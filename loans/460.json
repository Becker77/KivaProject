Everything turned out as planned because she was able to pay her daily expenses and provide for her children. She began her business about eight years ago and little by little she has been able to succeed. She started out just selling just food items and other household items. Then, she decided that since she had enough space, she would open up an internet cafe in her store. Erika was able to invest her money in the internet caf\u00e9 and then earn more money since she always has paying customers using the computers.\r\n<p>\r\nShe needs a loan of $975 dollars.  She will pay it back in 6 months. That way it will help her upgrade her computers with better programs and to stock her little store with more items.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture, and Central Asian traditions.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>But, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.<\/p> \r\n\r\n<p>IMON's History<\/p>\r\n<p>Since December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

S. is 35 years old, is married, and is taking care of 2 children. He is a fighter and likes his work, even though, at times, it is very exhausting. He offers a tricitaxi (a bicycle-operated taxi) service. He has been pursuing this activity for more than 6 years. Before this, he raised livestock, but with the money from that, he succeeded in buying a bicycle. At first, he didn\u2019t have the experience needed for this, but over time, he got it. This loan that he is requested will be used to make improvements to his bicycle and to provide a better service to his clients. His dream is to succeed and for his children become professionals, since Adrian didn\u2019t have the opportunity to go to school. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Avni Shah, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":100,"image":{"id":360886,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Transportation","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"Capital for his business ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Leon","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.435556 -86.879444","type":"point"}},"partner_id":96,"posted_date":"2009-07-29T17:50:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":100,"lender_count":3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Adrian De Jesus ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-07-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2009-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2009-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2009-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2009-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2010-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":16.67,"local_amount":333.33,"processed_date":"2009-08-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T15:29:42Z","rounded_local_amount":340.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73600082},{"amount":16.66,"local_amount":333.33,"processed_date":"2009-09-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T17:57:14Z","rounded_local_amount":340.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87035973},{"amount":16.67,"local_amount":333.33,"processed_date":"2009-10-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T21:39:10Z","rounded_local_amount":340.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96948367},{"amount":16.67,"local_amount":333.33,"processed_date":"2009-11-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T12:32:37Z","rounded_local_amount":340.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103790312},{"amount":17.21,"local_amount":344.17,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T13:33:15Z","rounded_local_amount":351.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110680947},{"amount":16.12,"local_amount":322.51,"processed_date":"2010-01-21T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:34:40Z","rounded_local_amount":329.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118075486}],"funded_date":"2009-07-29T18:29:26Z","paid_date":"2010-02-15T11:34:40Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Avni","image":null}},{"id":129959,"name":"Adijat","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Adijat is a hair specialist and she also sells hair-cream and hair-extensions.

She is an ambitious and hard working person. She lives with her parents and with her sister Lisbet who is 22 years old. They live in their own home located in Palcamayo. Since she was 15 years old she has been baking breads for sale in her neighborhood and today she has her own bakery from where she sells pies and cakes. Her responsibilities soon grew when her sister, Lisbet, wanted to study to be a nurse at the university. So Jocelinda decided to study agriculture to help her parents in the harvests of sweet peas, potatoes, and vegetables. On the weekends she goes to supervise the fields and she barters for the best prices in the central markets in her city and in the capital. Jocelinda's favorite thing to do is to help her family. She would like to purchase in wholesale a stock of merchandise for her bakery with the goal of one day having her own fields. She will be able to have larger harvests of vegetables and be able to meet the demand.

This is a mixed group of 21 individuals living near each other. They are represented by Mrs. Sokhna D., who is the Vice-President. Mrs. D. has been working for over 30 years selling fabrics, shoes, palm oil and miscellaneous items. She also prepares food for sale. She has chosen this work because she was attracted to it but also in the desire to earn an income allowing her to provide for her personal needs. She is seeking a loan of 2,250,000 West African Francs for her group. This loan is destined for purchasing various goods to increase the members\u2019 stock. The main objective of the group members is to increase their income and to improve the socioeconomic conditions of their respective families. \n\nAbout this loan:\nAl Ouma is a Senegalese nonprofit whose full name is The Association for Koranic Education and Teaching. \n\nOriginally founded to work with at-risk children, especially talib\u00e9s (young boys from poor families who beg in Senegalese metropolitan areas),  Al Ouma has evolved its mission to work with adults as well as children.   They currently have over 10,000 members, and are actively engaged in supporting the economic development of their members in the hopes of improving their quality of life, and that of their at-risk children.\n\nAl Ouma's members are currently organized into smaller associations which meet each week to contribute to a group fund that helps finance small loans for members.  Members typically put in $2 USD per week.  Because UIMCEC and Al Ouma both share the mission of fighting poverty through economic empowerment, they have formed a partnership to provide loans to Al Ouma associations at a lower interest rate than UIMCEC usually offers its clients.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4750,"image":{"id":736487,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Bolstering

Prior to the marriage, she was studying to be a jewelry maker and is now involved in a fine jewelry business.  She makes women's national jewelry from gold with unusual designs.  Nasiba sells her goods at a market and primarily makes the jewelry to-order.  She has a large catalog of samples for every taste.  She does not yet have apprentices because she has a small child and would not have time for apprentices.  In the future, Nasiba plans to open her own shop and teach her trade to young women.  She has been partnering with us since 2010 and previously obtained a loan to purchase scrap to make her jewelry.  This is now her second time obtaining financing from us, and this is another loan to be used for household buildings.  Because Nasiba's husband is currently working outside the city limits, and their house construction has began, Nasiba needs our

Today thanks to the support that Ceprodel offered her for half the loans, she has been able to amplify her business in the purchase of materials such as plates utensils and place settings.

Su necesidad actualmente es invertir en infraestructura ya que su local es peque\u00f1o y adem\u00e1s no presenta buenas condiciones para los clientes.\r\n<\/div>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":115536,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Market","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"The sale of food.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Managua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.150833 -86.268333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":74,"posted_date":"2008-01-15T21:45:13Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Domitila Del Carmen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-01-29T23:02:28Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":6000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-02-29T08:00:00Z","amount":1500},{"due_date":"2008-03-29T07:00:00Z","amount":1500},{"due_date":"2008-04-29T07:00:00Z","amount":1500},{"due_date":"2008-05-29T07:00:00Z","amount":1500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":81.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":82,"local_amount":1513.85,"processed_date":"2008-02-29T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-05-30T09:26:21Z","rounded_local_amount":1556.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":145758},{"amount":82,"local_amount":1513.85,"processed_date":"2008-03-30T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-05-30T09:26:21Z","rounded_local_amount":1556.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":169548},{"amount":82,"local_amount":1513.85,"processed_date":"2008-04-30T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-05-30T09:26:21Z","rounded_local_amount":1556.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":196865},{"amount":79,"local_amount":1458.46,"processed_date":"2008-05-30T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-05-30T09:26:21Z","rounded_local_amount":1499.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":223625}],"funded_date":"2008-01-15T23:02:28Z","paid_date":"2008-05-30T09:09:33Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":35730,"name":"Veselin","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Veselin V. is registered as a private agricultural producer in the village of Rogozen near Vratza.

Her greatest dream is for her children to successfully complete their studies. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Laurie Paguio, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":360911,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"to purchase clothing to sell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Leon","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.435556 -86.879444","type":"point"}},"partner_id":96,"posted_date":"2009-08-03T21:10:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":450,"lender_count":3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Claudia Maria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-07-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":9000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":900},{"due_date":"2009-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":900},{"due_date":"2009-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":900},{"due_date":"2009-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":900},{"due_date":"2009-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":900},{"due_date":"2010-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":900},{"due_date":"2010-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":900},{"due_date":"2010-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":900},{"due_date":"2010-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":900},{"due_date":"2010-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":900}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":45,"local_amount":900,"processed_date":"2009-08-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T15:29:25Z","rounded_local_amount":918.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73600088},{"amount":45,"local_amount":900,"processed_date":"2009-09-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T17:57:29Z","rounded_local_amount":918.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87035980},{"amount":45,"local_amount":900,"processed_date":"2009-10-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T21:39:02Z","rounded_local_amount":918.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96948374},{"amount":1.25,"local_amount":24.95,"processed_date":"2009-11-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T12:31:39Z","rounded_local_amount":25.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103790321},{"amount":45.31,"local_amount":906.15,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T12:33:13Z","rounded_local_amount":924.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103790322},{"amount":45.27,"local_amount":905.31,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T13:33:38Z","rounded_local_amount":923.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110680954},{"amount":43.17,"local_amount":863.59,"processed_date":"2010-01-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:34:40Z","rounded_local_amount":881.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118075492},{"amount":45,"local_amount":900,"processed_date":"2010-02-19T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:08:59Z","rounded_local_amount":918.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123911524},{"amount":45,"local_amount":900,"processed_date":"2010-03-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-06T07:51:01Z","rounded_local_amount":918.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128947370},{"amount":45,"local_amount":900,"processed_date":"2010-04-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:20:01Z","rounded_local_amount":918.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136675652},{"amount":45,"local_amount":900,"processed_date":"2010-05-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:17:34Z","rounded_local_amount":918.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144710047}],"funded_date":"2009-08-13T05:48:09Z","paid_date":"2010-06-15T09:17:34Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Laurie Paguio","image":346696}},{"id":129975,"name":"Beatrice","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Beatrice is the 45-year-old mother of five children who are currently in school.

Previously she tried selling her handmade clothing to wholesale vendors, but they refused to pay her a good price.

Hilda has been selling her products from that location for the past two years.  Her business has proven to be very profitable, since she is able to cover her shop rent and her household expenses.  \r\n<p>\r\nIn addition, Hilda has farmland in which she grows oats (as seen in the photograph).  She stores whatever she harvests so that she can sell in times of drought.  Hilda successfully divides her time between both businesses in order to provide for her family\u2019s welfare.\r\n<p>  \r\nThis is Hilda\u2019s ninth loan with MFP.

While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nMarlina is married and has a school-aged child. To make a living, Marlina makes and sells food. The main source of income for the business comes from selling frozen products, fish and tamarind fruits. Marlina has been engaged in her business for over two years and earns approximately 5,000 Philippine pesos a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Marlina joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Marlina is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase new items to expand her product offering. This will be the second loan taken out by Marlina from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement her family's income. \r\n\r\n<b>About ASKI:<\/b>\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas.

lifetime, but by what that person imparts to the next generation. This is the reason that Yolanda G., 54, does well to improve her farm business--not just for herself but for her children as well. Yolanda's husband died a few years ago and, at present, she strives to raise their two children who are both in school. They currently reside in Silang, Cavite, south of the country capital, Manila.\r\n\r\nYolanda takes care of her own farm where she grows pineapples and bananas. When ripe, she sells these fruits to the community market and earns quite a lot. Also, she grows peanuts and sells them to business connections. This kind of business works as a lot of Filipinos love to eat steamed peanuts, fried peanuts and even peanuts turned into peanut butter. She also has a sari-sari (variety) store to cover whatever family needs remain. Yolanda earns around Php10,000 net income monthly.\r\n\r\nTo help her improve her peanut business, she decided to borrow Php30,000. She will use this loan in line with applying the entrepreneurial training she receives in CCT*. She will purchase necessary materials and acquire human resources to boost her peanut dealership. She says that the loan will largely support her business capital and enable her to make it grow.\r\n\r\nAt present, her difficulty is a low volume of product deliveries resulting is a low rate of sales. Nevertheless, Yolanda never gives up hope of making this business grow and continually strategizes for growth, because she knows this business will not only sustain her and her family now, but will be beneficial for her children in the future. She wants her eldest son to have a successful marriage someday.

of the Republic of Togo, and sells them, for cash or credit, in the city of Koutiala, both hawking and from home, to a clientele made up of women and men.\r\n\r\nSanata expects to make a monthly profit of 75,000 CFA francs which she will use to pay the interests of her loan and help to provide for the daily needs of the family, as well as reinvest in other income generating activities.\r\n<br

independizados, vive en el cercado de la ciudad de Chiclayo, ciudad bastante conocida por su movimiento comercial y de transporte.\n\nLa necesidad de salir adelante y apoyar a sus hijos hizo que hace ocho a\u00f1os empezara un negocio de venta de comida en su domicilio, empez\u00f3 con pocos utensilios e insumos y gracias a su esfuerzo el negocio ha ido creciendo, actualmente ya tiene un peque\u00f1o restaurante en donde atiende a sus clientes todos los dias, en su mayor\u00eda son trabajadores de la zona que acuden a almorzar durante la hora de almuerzo, su buena saz\u00f3n y la amabilidad con la que trata a sus clientes han hecho que su negocio goce de muy buena preferencia.\n\nLa continua demanda por su negocio ha hecho que los insumos con los que cuenta no sean suficientes para brindar una buena atenci\u00f3n, por ello Hilda desea ampliar su restaurante con la compra de mesas, sillas y algunos insumos para preparar m\u00e1s platos de comida, por ello se ha visto en la necesidad de solicitar por primera vez a Edpyme Alternativa un cr\u00e9dito de 2000 nuevos soles que le ayuden a lograr su objetivo.\n\nHilda es una mujer amable y que gusta mucho del trabajo que realiza, su m\u00e1s grande anhelo es seguir creciendo como empresaria. Ella es muy estimada por las personas que la conocen, las cuales la consideran una mujer de confianza y luchadora.\n\n","en":"Hilda is 51 years old, divorced, and has 3 children who are independent.  She lives near the city of Chiclayo, a city well known for its commercial and transport activity.\r\n\r\nThe need to move ahead and help her children some 8 years ago led her to launch a business selling meals from her house.  She began with few utensils and little supplies and thanks to her effort, the business has grown.  At present, she already has a small restaurant where she waits on customers every day.  The majority are workers from the zone who come for lunch around lunch time.  The good flavors of her food and the amiability she displays towards her customers has resulted in the restaurant gaining favor.\r\n\r\nThe rise in demand has resulted in short supplies, affecting her service.  For that reason, Hilda wishes to buy more supplies and to expand her restaurant by buying tables and chairs. Then she will be able to prepare more plates of food.  For that reason, she approached Edpyme Alternative for the first time, requesting a loan of 2,000 new sols that will help her achieve her objective.\r\n\r\nHilda is an amiable woman who likes her work very much.  Her great hope is to continue growing as an impresario.  She is much admired by those who know her.  They consider her a woman with confidence and fighting spirit.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Harold Sims, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":522368,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Restaurant","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"BUYING TABLES, CHAIRS, AND SUPPLIES TO IMPROVE SERVICES IN HER RESTAURANT","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Chiclayo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":143,"posted_date":"2010-04-10T19:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":725,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hilda Clarisa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":131.76},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":146.73},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":149.44},{"due_date":"2010-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":150.85},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":159.13},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":164.26},{"due_date":"2010-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":167.18},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":175.97},{"due_date":"2011-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":178.18},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":187.01},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":193.26},{"due_date":"2011-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":196.23}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.76},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.19},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.69},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.68},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.55},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.6},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.79},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":64.59},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.79},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.06},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.13}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":47.76,"local_amount":131.76,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:07:24Z","rounded_local_amount":135.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144695118},{"amount":53.19,"local_amount":146.73,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:38:39Z","rounded_local_amount":150.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151878163},{"amount":54.17,"local_amount":149.44,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T10:50:58Z","rounded_local_amount":153.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159618192},{"amount":54.69,"local_amount":150.85,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:01:48Z","rounded_local_amount":155.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166832592},{"amount":57.68,"local_amount":159.13,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T09:57:06Z","rounded_local_amount":163.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172099198},{"amount":457.51,"local_amount":1262.09,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-16T10:43:37Z","rounded_local_amount":1297.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177554620}],"funded_date":"2010-04-13T17:11:35Z","paid_date":"2010-11-16T10:43:37Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Harold Sims","image":602722}},{"id":196389,"name":"Hazem","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Hazem J. is 27 years old and from Gaza.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, Tajikistan is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She used to own a food sales business in which she made use of her culinary skills by preparing meals without the use of too much seasoning. Thus, her meals promoted good digestion for her patrons. However, her problem was that she was unable to pay rent for her business space. As a result, after finishing construction of her house, she got the idea of setting up a general store there. She has been in this business for almost 5 months now, during which time she has been drawing in customers, which makes her feel happy. She also supports her young children with their school work.

Her eldest daughter works as a waitress at the local restaurant and her next two daughters are attending a high school.\r\n\r\nIn 2006 Batsuuri started running a handicraft-making business. She buys sheep\u2019s wool, processes it and then makes Mongolian traditional handicrafts. She or her children sells them mostly to tourists. When summer comes she makes more handicrafts to sell tourists as many tourists come to visit Mongolia.\r\n\r\nWhen Batsuuri began running her business, her working capital was 50,000 tugrugs ($1 USD= 1450 MNT). As a result of her hard work, her business capital has increased 200,000 tugrugs. Besides running a handicraft business, to increase her family income, she plants vegetables on the land she owns. She requests a loan to buy raw material such as wool, wire and paint to increase her business

Ariendo is a system wherein poor people using wealthy people\u2019s farmland give cavans (sacks) of rice to the owner every harvest in payment. The amount depends on the agreement between both parties.\r\n\r\nBaltazara wishes to have her own land to farm someday on which her husband and her two sons will work. To start reaching that goal, she has no other choice for now but to continue to involve herself in the common practice of ariendo. The loan she is requesting will be used to start up this business for her family to be able to augment the income of her husband and two sons. With her loan assisting her farming business, someday she will be able to buy land of her own to

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She started her business eight years ago and, over the years, she has managed to position herself in the market.  In order to gain customers, she started out doing home visits and, once she had built up her customer base, she opened premises where she only had one chair and one mirror.

They have a 1 year-old son for whom they both dream of building a better future so that he grows up healthy, with the financial and social security that he deserves."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":776528,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty Salon","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to buy hairdressing supplies such as shampoo, rinses, massage products and work tools","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:33Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Delsy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-05-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":69798},{"due_date":"2011-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":76247},{"due_date":"2011-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":77709},{"due_date":"2011-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":79198},{"due_date":"2011-11-05T07:00:00Z","amount":80716},{"due_date":"2011-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":82263},{"due_date":"2012-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":83840},{"due_date":"2012-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":85447},{"due_date":"2012-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":87084},{"due_date":"2012-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":88753},{"due_date":"2012-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":90455},{"due_date":"2012-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":98490}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.39},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.93},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.74},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.56},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.4},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.24},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.11},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.9},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.81},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.75},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":38.39,"local_amount":69798,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:50:11Z","rounded_local_amount":70059.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221673775},{"amount":84.68,"local_amount":153956,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T10:21:42Z","rounded_local_amount":154533.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257188244},{"amount":426.93,"local_amount":776246,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:42:14Z","rounded_local_amount":779156.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276650725}],"funded_date":"2011-06-04T16:31:20Z","paid_date":"2012-05-15T09:42:14Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Oxnard","image":null}},{"id":307043,"name":"Ester","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"As a married parent of six children, Ester works hard to support her family. \r\n\r\nShe has a fish selling business in the Philippines, and also earns additional income from selling food and personal products.

Her future plan for her crops is to improve the yield.  With this loan, Rosa will purchase fertilizers and supplies to be able to improve her crops.  She thanks the lending institution for their support in these ten loan cycles, as it has helped her to make housing improvements and improve her crops.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Kathleen O&#039;Connell, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":381981,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farm Supplies","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To purchase fertilizers to be able to improve her crop yield","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Managua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.150833 -86.268333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":98,"posted_date":"2009-09-03T00:30:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-08-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":20000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":1000,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2011-02-21T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:05:23Z","rounded_local_amount":20506.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195765883}],"funded_date":"2009-09-17T15:53:56Z","paid_date":"2011-03-15T11:05:23Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen O'Connell","image":578556}},{"id":138253,"name":"Gila","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":" Gila G. is currently in the business of selling maize and sorghum  and is requesting a loan to purchase more maize to sell. <P>\r\n\r\n Gila is 30 years old and is married to a husband who is a businessman.

He is experienced in the business of making dried apricots.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.<P>\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Called chiya pasals, these tea shops make a sweet, milky tea that can be purchased for a few cents a cup.  With a Kiva loan, Patan BPW's borrowers are able to keep their store shelves stocked while increasing their profit margins by buying in greater volume.\r\n\r\nThis loan was administered by Kiva's local partner microfinance institution, Patan Business and Professional Women (Patan BPW).
