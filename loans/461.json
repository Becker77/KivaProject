They are all attending school. He is very hard-working and dedicated to his work. \r\n<p>\r\nSamuel has been a carpenter for 22 years. Carpentry has been his major occupation and provides the main source of his family's livelihood. He owns a carpentry shop, where he manufactures all kinds of furniture items. Samuel builds chairs, wardrobes, beds, and other such pieces. \r\n<p>\r\nHe tells us that lack of adequate working capital has prevented him from being able to pre-finance most of the orders he receives from his customers. This, he says, slows down his work because he is obliged to wait for full funds from his customers before any work can begin, which usually results in substantial delays.

Everyday he strives his best in all his farming activities from sowing the seeds to harvesting corn, potatoes, peas, and other crops. He also raises animals and sells them at the weekends at a livestock market close to his community. His children are his main support in all this work as they help him with the harvest and selling his produce, and this makes him feel satisfied with their achievements. For the future, he wants to carry on with his work.

Plus, he likes being part of the community bank because all the members are responsible people and very supportive. He is grateful to the people who manage the loan and it will be very useful to him in continuing his business.

He is married and the father of four children between the ages of 8 and 22. They are all attending school. He has been a farmer for twenty years. He sells maize, beans, tea, millet and milk locally.\r\n\r\nHe has requested this loan of 45,000 KES to purchase a dairy cow, which will help improve his family's living standards in terms of both food and income. In five years he aspires to start up a large retail shop business and have a posho mill.\r\n\r\nThe challenge he is facing is that market prices for farm produce are low and there is not enough financing available to purchase farming inputs like fertilizers, which affects his crop production.

18 years ago Mariela started her family with Dar\u00edo.  In the beginning things were very difficult for them, with family problems and many failures in each of the businesses that they entered.  As a product of these losses, her husband became involved with alcohol, and during those difficult years Mariela was the only support of her family.  She never lost hope and with the important support of her children decided to enter into the noble work of weaving clothing textiles.  Initially she only was dedicated to manual weaving, but by saving they implemented their factory piece by piece.  Currently they feel very proud and content for the results they have obtained, because finally life smiles on them and gives them the opportunity to progress.  Mariela and her husband Dar\u00edo have hopes to give a good education to her exemplary and loved children and in order to solidify their desires they plan to increase the volume of production.  With this goal, they appeal to your great heart and ask for a loan.

AMK has a delinquency rate of only 0.09% and AMK has a default rate of 0% on Kiva.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":202367,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To ask for a loan to purchase more chickens for breeding.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KH","country":"Cambodia","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 105","type":"point"}},"partner_id":109,"posted_date":"2008-09-12T21:50:49Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":600,"lender_count":1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Teng","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Vath","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Vath","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"San","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-09-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KHR","disbursal_amount":2400000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2008-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2008-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-02-26T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2010-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2010-02-26T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2010-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2010-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2010-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2010-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2010-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2010-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2010-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":600,"local_amount":2400000,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T09:33:42Z","rounded_local_amount":2503830,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172059280}],"funded_date":"2008-09-12T21:58:47Z","paid_date":"2010-10-15T09:33:42Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Nobles Microfinance Club","image":130048}},{"id":68987,"name":"Luis","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Lu\u00eds es un hombre muy trabajador, que con mucho esmero sale todas las ma\u00f1anas rumbo a sus terrenos de cultivo, junto a ello, cuida de sus vaquitas, las lleva todas las ma\u00f1anas a alimentarse.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93 percent of the country is mountainous and only 7 percent of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still lives in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients have a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

R. is from the village of Bitibut, Sapang Dalaga, Misamis Occidental.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling daily use products such as shampoo, soap, toothpaste etc., in the local community. Vergie has been engaged in her business for over one year and earns approximately 2500 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Vergie joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Vergie has successfully repaid a previous loan of 3000 PHP from GDMPC. Vergie is requesting a new loan of 6000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the second loan taken out by Vergie from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement her family's income. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

These factors have played into a difficult economic year for many Cambodians, Em S. included.\n\nIn light of these economic difficulties, Em S. is asking for a loan of US$1,200 to purchase a truck so that her family can transport goods from market to sell and also batteries.

Murodbeg is 36 years-old. He buys and sells cattle from different market places and has been in the business for the last 10 years. His main customers are butchers and livestock farmers. He is requesting a second loan after successfully repaying a first one. With the previous loan, Murodbeg was able to increase the number of heads that he trades. Murodbeg is married and the father of three children. With the loan from Kiva, he plans to increase his herd of cattle for trading and, if possible, open up his own butchery.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  Today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n\r\nTajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged an already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still lives in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Her husband Ronie T., who is 33 years old, works as a driver to earn his living. They have  no children. \r\n\r\nMeriam joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2007 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 3 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Meriam has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 7000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 4500, thus uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 4th loan, she is borrowing PHP 10,000, which she intends to use to purchase additional stock to sell in her general store so that she can continue to save up for the future. \r\n\r\nMeriam T. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\n\r\n In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed on a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Meet Monica, from Chuka, Kenya. Chuka is not known for farming but she is earning a living through agriculture. She is happily married and, together with her husband, is blessed with three lovely children. <br \/><br \/>For the past 10 years, she has been practicing mixed farming, and because of her experience, she commands a lot of respect from fellow farmers and she is regarded as a mentor. Income from goat and cow milk, eggs, and crop selling have allowed her to earn a decent income. To make the extra coin, Monica engages in small personal business. <br \/><br \/>Monica passionately loves dairy farming and animals on her farm have been given names. Milking and feeding her cows makes her very proud. Through milk selling, she has had quite good returns and the demand for milk has been expanding. Demand has been overwhelming and she needs an extra cow to satisfy fully the demand. <br \/><br \/>She is requesting a loan to buy a quality dairy cow. Monica does not intend to buy just an ordinary cow but she wants to buy a distinct breed that is easy to manage and has a natural ability to produce rich creamy milk. The dairy cow will be producing between 15 and 20 litres of milk a day. The increased milk production will translate to more income and Monica will be able to improve her living conditions and secure the future of her school-going children.<br \/><br \/>Listening to Monica speak, one would be forgiven for thinking that she is an expert in dairy farming, but because of passion and determination she intends to beat all odds. This loan will permanently change the living standards of Monica, and there is no doubt that you can find rewarding employment in dairy farming.<br \/><br \/>With your contribution this mum will be able to make her dreams a reality.

She has been selling fruit there for three years. After trying her hand at marketing several different products, she found her niche selling a variety of fresh and dried fruits. Through her creativity, hard work, and financial assistance in the form of loans and advice from \u201cNadiya Ukraine\u201d, her business has developed into a very successful enterprise. Svetlana maintains around $1000 in inventory. In a typical month she will see about $2000 worth of sales with a net income of a little over $1000. \r\n\r\nSvetlana is requesting a loan for $500 to supplement her available working capital. Her only son, who she raised by herself was, just recently married. Svetlana was able to help financially with the wedding but now needs to rebuild her cash reserves as the busy summer season approaches. She is excited about the possibility of helping her son and daughter-in-law further by opening a second vending location that her daughter-in-law could help run. Eventually, she may be able to operate a successful business of her own.   \r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n\u0421\u0432\u0456\u0442\u043b\u0430\u043d\u0430 \u0430\u043a\u0442\u0438\u0432\u043d\u043e

This small business has allowed her to cover food costs for her dear children.  She believes that increasing the variety of products and merchandise will ultimately be useful to her family.  While she dedicates her time running the store and taking care of her children, her husband Lorenzo works at an auto mechanic shop.

Luna, Cadiz City, Negros Occidental.\r\n\r\nMrs. K. knew that the small income that her husband earned was not enough for her dream for her children. This is the reason why she decided to join NWTF-Project Dungganon - to borrow enough capital to start a business to supplement her husband's income.\r\n\r\nUsing her first loan, she put up a food stall, selling different kind of fruit in the local market of Cadiz. She noticed that her business income helped her very much with the needs of her family. Her business is doing well and earns about PHP 12,000 per month.\r\n\r\nThis new loan of Php 13,000 is Mrs. K.'s 9th and will be utilized for the purchase of additional inventory and as working capital. The profits from this will be used to supplement her family's income.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b> About NWTF:<\/b>\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the call of not just a few, but thousands of women.

They have learned to live a life where they can finally be called honorable.

chasm in two small jumps. This is a motto of Nazira N., the leader of this group, who once decided to change her life totally and she did succeed. Now what she has is the result of her determination and a little bit thanks to curiosity. She is a person who is impatient and always wants something more than what she has. Her eager desire to obtain more from life leads her to victory. She married at the age of 20, and now at 23 she is the mother of two children. Her husband is a security guard in the night club. As soon as her first son was born, her ambitious mind did not let her stay at home and she immediately organized a business. At first, she got a loan about 7,000 KGS to build a small grocery shop inside of the house. With the rest of the money she bought goods for daily use. Now she has a refrigerator in the shop, which was purchased to sell ice-cream. The business flourishes day to day, and in the future she wants to buy a car and build a bigger shop. Now her profit per month is 5,000 KGS. With this loan she is going to buy foodstuff to increaseher sales. \r\n\r\nDamira A. is a 27-year-old wife and mother of two little children. Her husband is at home and they both deal with breeding and selling horses and cattle. This business was inherited. She has a shop where she is going to sell daily foodstuff, so she wants to get a loan to buy foodstuff. \r\n\r\nAynagul S. is a 53-year-old wife and mother of seven children who are all married and live separately. Her husband is at home and looks after livestock. They are breeding, fattening and selling cattle. Also they sell milk. They started a business with 25,000 KGS and now the total revenue is 7,000 KGS. She wants to get a loan to buy a cow in order to sell milk.\r\n\r\nSoltobek T. is 63-years-old and a married father of five children, three who are married and live separately and two who attend school. He bought a car with saved money and began to trasport passengers. His revenue is 13,000 KGS per month. He already married off his son and bought a house. He is planning to change his car and save money for the wedding of his other son. Now he wants to get a loan to buy bull-calves in order to fatten them and resell afterward.\r\n\r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance, a young and ambitious socially-focused MFI in Kyrgyzstan.

Silvestrina wants to save money because, even though her children are not living in her house, she feels the need to help and support them anytime.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1700,"image":{"id":625377,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy rice, flour, and other foods","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"DO","country":"Dominican Republic","town":"Puerto Plata","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"19.75 -70.75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":44,"posted_date":"2010-10-25T17:10:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1700,"lender_count":42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Silvestrina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eira","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Naharony","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Natividad","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gumercinda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Melisa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yolanda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Luisa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Colombina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-09-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"DOP","disbursal_amount":62000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":4690.28},{"due_date":"2010-10-27T07:00:00Z","amount":4777.83},{"due_date":"2010-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":4867.03},{"due_date":"2010-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":4957.86},{"due_date":"2010-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":5050.42},{"due_date":"2010-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":5144.69},{"due_date":"2011-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":5240.72},{"due_date":"2011-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":5338.56},{"due_date":"2011-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":5438.21},{"due_date":"2011-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":5539.73},{"due_date":"2011-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":5643.13},{"due_date":"2011-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":5311.54}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":128.6},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":131.01},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":133.45},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":135.94},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":138.48},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":141.06},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":143.7},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":146.38},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":149.11},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":151.9},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":154.73},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":145.64}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":128.6,"local_amount":4690.28,"processed_date":"2010-10-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T13:41:35Z","rounded_local_amount":4745.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177395562},{"amount":131.01,"local_amount":4777.83,"processed_date":"2010-10-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T13:42:28Z","rounded_local_amount":4834.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177395563},{"amount":133.45,"local_amount":4867.03,"processed_date":"2010-11-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T13:51:27Z","rounded_local_amount":4924.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182534090},{"amount":135.94,"local_amount":4957.86,"processed_date":"2010-11-24T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T13:52:13Z","rounded_local_amount":5016.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182534091},{"amount":138.48,"local_amount":5050.42,"processed_date":"2010-12-08T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T12:58:20Z","rounded_local_amount":5109.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188670857},{"amount":141.06,"local_amount":5144.69,"processed_date":"2010-12-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T12:59:13Z","rounded_local_amount":5205.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188670858},{"amount":891.46,"local_amount":32511.89,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T03:02:17Z","rounded_local_amount":32894.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191414202}],"funded_date":"2010-10-26T21:31:00Z","paid_date":"2011-02-16T03:02:17Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":246029,"name":"Thelma","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Thelma C. is a 52-year-old married woman who supports her family by operating three business ventures: tricycle, food vending and catering. She lives in Catlagan, Bgry. Daan Banwa, Kabankalan City, Negros Occidental. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2005 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her tricycle, food vending and catering businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average income of PHP 6,000. Thelma is now borrowing PHP 25,000 to purchase raw materials. This will be her 12th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 19,500, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey towards economic freedom. Thelma aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future wellbeing by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

Throughout her life she has had to work at whatever was possible that would produce income in exchange.  Not having finished secondary school and believing, like in the old days, that the more children one had the greater ability to cultivate the fields and earn more money to eat and have health, those priorities led her not to plan her family.  With no other alternative now, she must split herself up to work from sun to sun.\r\n\r\nShe works selling dry goods (maize, dehydrated potato, L. beans, grains, Quinoa, broad beans, pallares beans).  She also sells small farm animals (guinea pigs and barnyard fowl).  She sells in the Combapata market.  In addition, when suppliers bring coca leaves from the Peruvian jungle in small amounts she takes them to her stand in the market to sell too.  Coca leaf is considered to be a sacred plant and Incas grew it in antiquity.  It\u2019s currently part of our cultures and it\u2019s known only for its properties, not as a drug.  In Andean society this leaf is too sacred to desecrate using it for evil like some humans do against other humans. With what her sales of products and small animals produce she educates and feeds her minor children.\r\n\r\nShe is asking for a loan to buy small farm animals and a few dry goods that she does not grow herself.\r\n\r\nThe other group members alternate their activities with retail sales.  They grind grains.  Most of them have small or large mills that they least out in town to grind various products which the people can then go sell at wholesale in cities throughout most of Per\u00fa.\r\n\r\nShe is grateful for and values the loan granted by this means and at the same time pledges to repay in a timely fashion.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2600,"image":{"id":655955,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To buy small farm animals and a few dry grains that she doesn't grow.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Quispicanchi - Cusco","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":119,"posted_date":"2010-12-05T03:50:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2600,"lender_count":94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Paulina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Otorino ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sonia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ubaldina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Esperanza ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alejandrina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Silveriana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tomasa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Remigia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Nayda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-11-26T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":7300,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":2600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":1100.69},{"due_date":"2011-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":1144.78},{"due_date":"2011-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":1190.53},{"due_date":"2011-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":1238.14},{"due_date":"2011-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1287.63},{"due_date":"2011-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1338.23}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":392.03},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":407.73},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":424.02},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":440.98},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":458.61},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":476.63}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":392.03,"local_amount":1100.69,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T12:27:36Z","rounded_local_amount":1109.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188633288},{"amount":407.73,"local_amount":1144.78,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T01:40:38Z","rounded_local_amount":1153.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191375913},{"amount":424.02,"local_amount":1190.53,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:21:35Z","rounded_local_amount":1199.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195793369},{"amount":440.98,"local_amount":1238.14,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T10:19:50Z","rounded_local_amount":1247.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201235124},{"amount":458.61,"local_amount":1287.63,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T10:15:48Z","rounded_local_amount":1297.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206101384},{"amount":476.63,"local_amount":1338.23,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T10:37:22Z","rounded_local_amount":1348.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211171817}],"funded_date":"2010-12-18T02:14:16Z","paid_date":"2011-06-15T10:37:22Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":258321,"name":"Alphajor","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Here is Alphajor J., a small-scale businessman in Kabala, a town in northern Sierra Leone.

She lives apart from her partner. She is the caretaker of her son Carlos, 12 years old, and he is the reason why she will continue to work arduously. She lives in a rented house. Nelida is the sole support of the household. Since she was a girl her parents taught her how to work in the land. Today she is an agriculturist and she has 2 hectares of land where she cultivates coffee and cocoa, plants that are native to the jungle region of Valle Rio Apurimac. She has been working on her own land for the past 11 years and during the harvest she has help from farm hands who offer their services to help collect the products. What she most enjoys about her work is the harvest and its quality is the reward for months of hard work. She considers the most difficult part of her work to be the transportation of her products to the depots located in the city of San Francisco. She is able to get better prices for her products there. The difficulty rests on the fact that she doesn't have enough financial resources to make the advanced payments to the farm hands who help with the harvest. This is the reason why she accesses loans through MFP (Kiva Field Partner). But her priority now is to plant more coffee plants. She has 1 hectare of land that is not currently used. This is her eighth loan through MPF and she feels that this support will help her a great deal to progress in her work. She is very well liked by her colleagues at their communal bank, especially because she is so committed to them. With the 500 nuevos soles she requests she will hire farm hands to help her with the harvest."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":742702,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to hire farm hands to help her with the harvest","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-03-31T11:30:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":200,"lender_count":6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nelida ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-03-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":200}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":200,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:42:48Z","rounded_local_amount":562.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244621124}],"funded_date":"2011-03-31T15:23:29Z","paid_date":"2011-12-15T10:42:48Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":291104,"name":"Jenny","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jenny P. is from the village of Victoria, Alicia, Isabela.

She is mainly motivated by her three sons and her parents, with whom she lives. Being abandoned by her partner has caused her to go through various difficulties which she could only face with the help of her family. \r\n\r\nSince being very young she has worked in various fields, but for the last seven years she has worked selling clothing, moving about in her district market - a place that is very crowded but that also has more delinquency, which is why she always tries to take the necessary precautions. Moreover, selling in the entrance to the markets is not an easy task since she has to set up her awning very early because people generally visit the market in the morning. She sells until 3:00 in the afternoon and after that returns home to take care of her children. \r\n\r\nCarmen's wish is to buy a stall inside the market so she can stop exposing herself to the danger, have better security, and have economic stability in her business. The years that she has working in her community bank have given her the opportunity to grow economically and this fourth loan will help her to improve and provide the possibility to continue working with her companions with whom she has many projects to carry out as a group, such as organization. With the 1800 soles that she is requesting she will acquire a larger quantity of clothing merchandise for the winter season. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Daniel Burke, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":331952,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"Increase her merchandise","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-06-09T22:20:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":625,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Carmen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-05-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1800,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2009-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2009-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2009-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2009-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2009-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":300}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.17},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.17},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.17},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.17},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":104.17},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":104.15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":104.17,"local_amount":300,"processed_date":"2009-06-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:42:52Z","rounded_local_amount":311.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52990735},{"amount":104.17,"local_amount":300,"processed_date":"2009-07-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:44:29Z","rounded_local_amount":311.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63211837},{"amount":104.17,"local_amount":300,"processed_date":"2009-08-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:26:41Z","rounded_local_amount":311.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73641362},{"amount":104.17,"local_amount":300,"processed_date":"2009-09-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:39:08Z","rounded_local_amount":311.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87080802},{"amount":104.17,"local_amount":300,"processed_date":"2009-10-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:12:53Z","rounded_local_amount":311.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96996941},{"amount":104.15,"local_amount":300,"processed_date":"2009-11-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:55:35Z","rounded_local_amount":311.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103842281}],"funded_date":"2009-06-10T01:11:09Z","paid_date":"2009-12-15T13:55:35Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Daniel Burke","image":11816}},{"id":118173,"name":"Bayarsayhan","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Bayarsayhan S. lives with his wife and two teenage children in Ovorhangai province, one of Mongolia's central provinces.

She began by selling these products; now she prepares and sells spices, condiments, and salsas, and thus her earnings have increased. Her store is located in a small space within her home, where she warmly serves her customers. She is very happy with her business, given that it allows her to take care of her children. However, acquiring the goods she needs requires her to carry the heavy load uphill to her house. Her greatest desire is to construct her house with durable materials and extend her store, thus improving her quality of life. This is her second loan with MFP, and she knows that this contribution will be very beneficial for increasing her working capital. She is committed to making all payments on her loan, and she also enjoys working with her colleagues in the group.

She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 1998 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. \r\n\r\nBy working hard in her salt, shrimp paste, frozen foods and fishing businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable.

This will be her 23rd loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon.  Her previous loan of PHP 11,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey towards economic freedom.  \r\n\r\nRizalina aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the  Dungganon way.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). \r\n\r\nThrough the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams.

Sometimes Yolanda's children help her with the business, but generally she prepares everything by herself and offers to her clients breakfast and lunch. She likes this line of work because she does not have to work the whole day to make a living though she does have to start very early in the morning. Yolanda is already used to this schedule and the food preparation business is the main source for her financial stability.\r\n\r\nIn addition, Yolanda also has a sound equipment rental business; this helps her increase her earnings. She has several goals that she would like to achieve, and one of them is to have a spacious commercial location. This is Yolanda's 10th loan with MFP; she feels very happy to be a part of her communal bank because it helps her grow as a person and develop true friendships with the other members of the bank.

The purpose of the loan is to increase their inventory and acquire new products for the Christmas season which is when they have the most sales.  Most of the group members have experience in support groups so they are familiar with the responsibility and commitment necessary to progress; as their name says, these are seeds of progress that will improve the lives of their families.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Scott Crandall, Kiva

family. Ten years ago, she got the idea to start raising cattle to contribute to the family finances, taking advantage of the space she had available in their land for this business. She and her husband are engaged in this business together. Slowly, the number of cows has increased and her clients have started asking for more and more. With an endless list of requests, she has finally decided to increase the number of livestock she keeps and for this reason she is requesting a loan.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture, and Central Asian traditions. \r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still lives in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He was one of the first people to join this lending group nine years ago, and then he dropped out.  Moses is frank to tell Pearl Microfinance Limited that for the three cycles he was out (one year), things were slow and his level of hard work had dropped a bit, and this affected his income. \r\n<p>\r\nHe is the Chairman of the village and also has rental houses in Semuti trading centre that helps bring in money.

He is 29 years old, married, and is the father of 2 children who are 6 and 9 years old.  They both go to school.  He did not go to school because his parents at that time didn't let him study.  This was because they gave priority to working on the machamba (a small agricultural field) and in the cattle pasture.  He lives in the service worker houses with his family and even supports his mother and a nephew, who both live with him.\r\n\r\nHe has never left Boane, only leaving his parents' house to build his own home.  He works together with his wife in Banalandia at a banana production and sales business in Boane District.  He works about 8 hours each day and receives a monthly salary of 1,630 MZN that he uses for household expenses.  He even saves some through Xitique (a traditional rotating savings system).\r\n\r\nHe has never had loans through banks.  He found out about Hluvuku through service colleagues who are also clients of this institution.  This is his 2nd loan, which has a value of 10,000 MZN.  With it, he plans to buy construction materials (beams, panes, cement, steel, sand, and windows) in order to continue with the construction of his house.  The previous loan was for 6,600 MZN, for the same purpose.\r\n\r\nIn the future, he would like to ask for more loans in order to continue to build his house and provide better living conditions for his family.\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Erika Korowin, Kiva

Shadai is 18 years old and lives in the town of Mukono in the Mukono region of Uganda. She is single and has no children.

The loan will be used to purchase more cosmetics like lotions and braids. With the help of this loan, she hopes to generate greater profits and be able to buy food at home and to pay school fees for herself.\r\n\r\nIn the future, Shadia hopes to travel to Rwanda.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>Note to lenders:<\/b>\r\nBRAC Uganda has recently begun posting a new loan product to Kiva that funds young entrepreneurs in BRAC\u2019s Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. This Kiva borrower is receiving a new ELA loan.\r\n\r\nThe ELA program first provides disadvantaged adolescents, usually girls who are out of school, with livelihood training and financial literacy skills. Afterwards, ELA participants can receive micro-finance loans to expand their small businesses. These loans offer adolescents a unique chance to access finance at a young age and improve their prospects for the future, and target a segment of the population not typically served by traditional micro-finance.\r\n\r\nKiva is privileged to partner with BRAC Uganda in posting these new loans, and give Kiva lenders the opportunity to fund deserving young entrepreneurs and support a promising new sector in micro-finance.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":100,"image":{"id":581694,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics

Sobre Talca existe una curiosa referencia en Chile, la frase \"Talca, Par\u00eds, y Londres\". Entre los mitos al respecto, algunos dicen que es una derivaci\u00f3n de la originalmente dicha por un ingl\u00e9s \"Talca parece Londres\", por la abundante neblina que cubre frecuentemente la ciudad en la temporada invernal, a semejanza de la capital del Reino Unido.\n","en":"This communal bank is called \u201cDespertar\u201d (To Awaken) and is composed of 18 entrepreneurs who are in a variety of businesses such as: underwear sales, honey and vegetable sales, marmalade making and selling, drape and curtain making, metallic structure manufacturing.  All are from the city of Talca.\r\n\r\nErika, who in the photo appears seated in the first row on the first spot from left to right and is wearing a white jacket with a lilac kerchief around her neck, sells used clothes at home all day and on weekends at a farmers market.  Her customers are recurring so she knows them and gives them easy payment terms.  She buys her merchandise, specifically bundles of clothes, every three months in the city of Santiago.\r\n\r\nIn the next few months, Erika will start a new business selling snacks, beverages and sandwiches.  To do so, she\u2019s awaiting delivery of a sales kiosk that she\u2019ll set up outside a school.  She will, therefore, invest the loan money in merchandise to stock her new business.  If it doesn\u2019t work out for her though, she\u2019ll buy more bundles of clothes to stock her original business.\r\n\r\nHer goals are to finally be able to make the new business a reality and to provide work for her daughter-in-law while Erika will be able to split her time among both businesses.  Besides, she\u2019d like her clothing sales business to expand and to build a shed in her yard to set it up as a clothing store with dressing rooms and display cases included.\r\n\r\nErika lives with her husband, her 18-year-old daughter and 9-year-old granddaughter.  Her dream on a personal level is to have an independent business that will allow her to have a better quality of life for her family.\r\n\r\nShe is very grateful to Fondo Esperanza.  She likes taking part in the meetings very much because she learns from the trainers.  Besides, she\u2019s managed to apply what she\u2019s learned to her business; she now spreads out her expenses and is more organized.\r\n\r\nTalca is part of the Maule region located in the center of our country.  It is the region\u2019s administrative, economic and cultural center being the most important city in Chile\u2019s Central Valley.  There is a curious reference to Talca in Chile, the phrase: \u201cTalca, Paris and London.\u201d  Among the myths relating to it, some say it derives from what an Englishman once said: \u201cTalca parece Londres,\u201d because of the abundant fog that frequently covers the city in winter like in the capital of the United Kingdom.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4925,"image":{"id":780050,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Used

She has a small farm in which she grows plantains that she sells in her local market. Because this fruit is seasonal (it is produced every 6 months), she is forced to purchase plantains from other farms so that she can keep her business afloat. She has been in business for 8 years, and counts on her husband, who is in charge of picking the fruit or buying it from other farms, for support. Teofila then sells the plantains at the market. What she likes about her job is that it allows her to stay active. Furthermore, it is lucrative because this fruit is in high demand and sells well everyday. Teofila has obtained 6 loans with MFP, and what she likes about her microfinance institute is that all of its members are good people who are punctual with their repayments. The money that she is requesting at this time will be used to purchase 1,000.00 PEN worth of plantains.
