Riski is 46 years old and a widow with two children. She sells women\u2019s shawls in the central market of Shahrituz and her business has been successful for 15 years. Riski\u2019s sales are the main source of her income which allows her to improve the living conditions in her home and to provide her children with education. She requests $1000 to purchase more shawls in order to increase the range of goods she offers for sale. Riski would like to thank everyone for supporting her and promises to pay off the loan on time.\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and with it\u2019s famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is 44 years old and is the group leader of this two-member group loan offered by PMPC. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are both collectively responsible for paying back the loan of their fellow group member if they are delinquent or default. The official name of this borrowing group is Crispina J. Group.\n\nCrispina is married and has five school-aged children. She owns and operates a business planting and harvesting corn for sale. She has been engaged in her business for over fifteen years and earns approximately 1,500 PHP a month.\n\nIn 2008, Crispina joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 12,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional seeds, seedlings and young crops to raise.\n\nCrispina is requesting a new loan of 7,000 PHP which will be used to purchase fertilizer such as manure. This loan will be her 7th from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay her children\u2019s tuition fees. \n\n\nAbout PMPC:\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\n\n\n *Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Balao, Solana, Cagayan. He is 30 years old, married and has three school-aged children. He makes a living by raising livestock, principally pigs, which he fattens before selling. He has been in this line of work for more than two years and earns about 3,500 PHP each time he sells an animal. \r\n\r\nEarlier this year, Danilo joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve his life and ability to engage in business.

town of Thanh Hoa. H\u1ed3ng is the group leader of a 5-member group loan offered by Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they all are responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is 11-\u0110\u00f4ng V\u1ec7 (08.01.11-\u0110\u00f4ng V\u1ec7).\n\nH\u1ed3ng is married and has 2 school-aged children. To make a living, H\u1ed3ng owns and operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising livestock.

H\u1ed3ng has been engaged in this business for over 5 years and earns approximately 2,500,000 VND a month from these activities.\n\nIn 2010, H\u1ed3ng joined Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. H\u1ed3ng has successfully repaid a previous loan of 3,253,800 VND from Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women. This previous loan was used to purchase baby livestock to raise and sell in the future. She is now requesting a new loan of 6,159,600 VND which will be used to purchase livestock feed and other supplies. The loan will be the 2nd loan taken out by the borrower from Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women. H\u1ed3ng plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family.\n\n\nAbout the Other Borrowers in the Group:\n\n\n1.  N.

The entrepreneur resides in Aravan, a small but cozy southern town situated on Silk Road. The town is a melting pot of people of various occupations such as farmers, cattle breeders, carpenters and ceramic masters. Santalat was born, got married and raised three children in this blessed place. It is a Kyrgyz wedding tradition for gifts to be made to both a bride and a groom. Santalat, according to custom, received a young colt. Over time, by re-selling already grown horses, she was able to generate capital to purchase her very first sheep and a dairy cow. She increased the number of cattle to four sheep and two cows. Every morning Santalat yields several liters of milk, which she uses to make various milk products. Her cattle breeding business was started with initial capital in the amount of 3 000 soms, while a monthly profit is typically 2 500 soms. Meanwhile, her husband\u2019s monthly income from driving a cab is 3 000 soms. Santalat believes that  a constant flow of income into her family's budget will allow her to repay the loan, which she requests so that she can purchase a refrigerator. \r\n\r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\n This loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance (MBF), a young, ambitious and socially-focused Microfinance Institution in Kyrgyzstan.

Single, she manages her own household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for her everyday expenses.  \r\n\r\nAnagina operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a Php5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Aside from this, she also sells direct-selling products to her customers. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of Php300 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php 10,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nAnagina hopes to be able to expand soon and dreams of opening a restaurant someday.

Santo Domingo is a colorful and picturesque city.\r\n\r\nWhile Jaime works as a chauffeur, Sara has been the owner of a neighborhood store for the past two years, a business that she began on the advice of family members. She works between ten and twelve hours a day with the help of her children and sometimes her husband. Little by little the business is growing, but it is difficult not having capital to invest in it. This is why she has decided to request this loan, which she will use to buy merchandise. Once she has her store better stocked she will be able to sell more and to have a higher income. In spite of the fact that this is her first loan, her credit evaluation showed her to be an enterprising woman with a low risk of defaulting, so it is expected that Sara will make her payments on time.\r\n\r\nSara's dream is to have a modern mini market with a variety of products. In this way she will be able to have a better quality of life and to continue to educate her children."}},"status":"deleted","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1095362,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to invest in her grocery store","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Santo Domingo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":190,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sara Magdalena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-04-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":415.68,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":53.32},{"due_date":"2012-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":57.7},{"due_date":"2012-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":58.59},{"due_date":"2012-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":59.72},{"due_date":"2012-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":61},{"due_date":"2012-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":62.06},{"due_date":"2012-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":63.29}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.52},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.99},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.9},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.06},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.37},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.45},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":64.71}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kate Kremer","image":null}},{"id":450810,"name":"Joseph","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Joseph is 55 years old and has five children who are in school.

She is married and the mother of three, plus she has two other people to support.  Having lacked the chance to excel in school due to a lack of financial means, she soon got started in an apprenticeship for making bread (baking) with the help of her parents.  At the end of her training, thanks to her know-how, she quickly won over the trust of her customers through the quality of her product.  Right now, the demand exceeds the supply, but Ms. K. doesn\u2019t have the means necessary to respond to the need.  She\u2019s therefore requesting financing to get situated appropriately, to get supplies of flour and sugar, and to equip herself with tools of the trade.  The revenues derived from this work will enable her to do better in helping to cover family expenses and to provide the right education for her children.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by

She is 30 years old. Marites is the group leader of a five-member group loan offered by ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n<p>\r\nMarites is married and has two school-aged children. To make a living, Marites owns and operates a general store. While not the only means of generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from selling a variety of different products in the local community. Marites has been engaged in her business for over 13 years and earns approximately 5,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2009, Marites joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Marites has successfully repaid a previous loan of 7,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional products to sell. Marites is requesting a new loan of 15,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase new items to expand her range of products offered. This loan will be the third loan taken out by Marites from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated by the business to improve and expand the business. \r\n<p>\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n<p>\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs. \r\n<p>\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

She is 39 years old, married, and has five adult-aged children. To make a living, Ligaya owns and operates a business venture in the retail sector. The main source of income for the business comes from selling household items and making food to sell in her local community. Ligaya has been engaged in her business for over six years and earns approximately 3,500 PHP per month from these activities. Her husband is a motorcycle driver and has his own motorbike.\r\n<br>In 2001, Ligaya joined Kiva partner, PMPC, to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 50,000 PHP from PMPC. This loan was used to acquire a motorcycle. Ligaya is requesting a new loan of 50,000 PHP, which will be used as additional capital. This loan will be her twentieth from PMPC. \r\n<p>\r\n<b>About PMPC<\/b><br>\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao.

name is Florentina Maria M., and I am a native of Bela-Vista in the district of Matutuine. I am 41 years old, a married mother of two, and a daughter of a polygamous father. I grew up in a large family with nearly 22 siblings; thus, obtaining an education was difficult. For survival, I learned how to fish at a young age, and, because of my talent for sewing, my father decided to enroll me in a sewing school at the age of 18. To purchase sewing materials, I would sell horticultures. At the end of my sewing courses I worked as a waitress in a tavern because of my lack of experience. After a year, I acquired a sewing machine and began to work from home. Right now I have 4 sewing machines, one machine to make buttonholes, a tailor\u2019s workshop, and 3 employees (two women and one man). With the current loan I intend to increase the volume of my business and transform the tailor\u2019s workshop into a sales boutique where we would sell appropriate materials and diverse fabrics\u2014right now I only work with fabrics provided by my clients. \r\n<p>Florentina\u2019s business\u2019 impact on the community is great; currently there exists no dressmaker with the same quality of service who also offers greatly reduced costs to visitors to Maputo seeking a dressmaker.

After working for years in nail salons throughout northern California, Anh made a bold decision to pursue her dream and became her own boss. Anna Kim Chi Beauty Salon has now been in business in downtown Redwood City, California for six years.  \r\n\r\nHer parents doubted her decision to go into business for herself. \u201cMy mother and father were worried and tried to convince me to give this up. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t listen. I was confident and determined to make my salon a success. The more effort you put in, and the braver you are in your life, the more success you will have.\u201d\r\n\r\nIn addition to haircuts, Anh\u2019s salon also provides nails, waxing, and skin-care services. Her salon attracts foot traffic from around the neighborhood, and with her low priced quality services, customers keep coming back. It\u2019s a simple formula, explains Anh. \u201cGood haircuts, good service, and low prices!\u201d On a recent day, Anh proudly wore her \u201cI Voted\u201d sticker from the November 2nd elections as she cut her client\u2019s hair and she proudly boasts, \u201cThis country has been so good for my family. I love to vote!\u201d\r\n\r\nWhen Anh needed financing to make improvements to her salon, she turned to Opportunity Fund - her local microfinance institution (MFI) - for a small business loan.  Anh learned about Opportunity Fund years ago when her eldest daughter opened a savings account through the non-profit MFI. With a $3,500 loan she will be able to make electrical renovations and bring her salon into compliance with fire codes.  Anh is also excited to have the chance to use a microloan to build her credit.  \u201cI don\u2019t need a lot of money at once, so this is very good. Then, once Opportunity Fund knows me and that I can repay, I\u2019ll be able to get another loan to help with a bigger remodeling job.\u201d

She is 19 years old, and has a high school degree.  She is married and has a son named Bernardo Israel who is 1 years old.  She and her husband have an auto body and requests a loan to increase her business.  She will buy paint, thinner, oil, primer, sandpaper.  She offers services of auto painting, fixing dents, etc.  In addition, she also sells honey, royal jelly (dietary supplement made from bees) and brown sugar.  Her business is called \"The Honey Auto Body Shop.\"  She started this business 5 years ago, and she started selling honey in her body shop 4 years ago.  Her business is a family business; her parents taught her the honey  and royal jelly business, and she inherited the business from them.  \r\n\r\nHer favorite part of the work is selling honey and decorating the containers with lace that she puts on them.  She is proud because she was taught to work hard to succeed.  She sells the most during the vacation periods of April and December. Her customers are tourists, since her business is at the side of a highway and the tourists stop to buy the honey products.  The challenge she faces with her business is the climate, since during the rainy season she cannot get the merchandise because it gets wet. She will use her earnings to invest in the business.  Her business has helped her, because she is not employed, but has her own business and in this way is able to support her son.

She is separated from her husband with whom she had 5 children. As a result of the separation she had to raise them by herself and with minimal help from their father. So she has educated and fed her five children, four of whom are now grown and have their own families, and she only has an 8 year-old daughter in her charge. Her daughter is her reason for working to get ahead day after day. She lives in her own house along with her daughter. \r\n\r\nHilda\u2019s work consists of selling food. Every day in the front yard of her house she sets up her table and grill and starts to prepare her exquisite vegetable stews. Among the things she sells we find Juanes [similar to a tamale], all kinds of grilled items, roasted plantain fritters with pork, and other wonderful foods with her special seasoning and kitchen secrets. She has been doing this most recent job for a year. In addition to this job, she also works for a government agency and has an income from that from that as well. She does it by herself and things are going well for her because she has the two incomes and this allows her to provide a better quality of life for her daughter. What she likes about her job is that it allows her to have an extra income in addition to her salary as a state employee. At first things were a little complicated when she began her business, but little by little she got used to it. Like all women who want to get ahead in life, she has many goals. Her main goal for now is to focus on her business and improve the infrastructure of her house, where she works. She also wants to begin to raise chickens to sell for the end-of-the-year festivities. \r\n\r\nThis will be her second loan with Microfinanzas Prisma. She is very happy to know that she will have financial help, since this way she will feel more sure of making progress with her business. She also promises once again to make her repayments, as she did with the previous loan she had. With the requested amount of PEN 1,000.00, she will buy ingredients so she can continue to do her job. She will also buy some chicks and feed so she can begin raising them.   \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":923631,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy ingredients for making food and also baby chickens so she can start raising them for sale ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-11-21T06:30:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hilda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-10-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":148.74},{"due_date":"2011-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":159.72},{"due_date":"2012-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":159.09},{"due_date":"2012-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":171.6},{"due_date":"2012-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":178.01},{"due_date":"2012-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":182.84}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.78},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.89},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.66},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.35},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.76},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.56}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":55.78,"local_amount":148.74,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:42:15Z","rounded_local_amount":150.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244622063},{"amount":59.89,"local_amount":159.72,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:51:19Z","rounded_local_amount":161.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250836166},{"amount":59.66,"local_amount":159.09,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:17:51Z","rounded_local_amount":161.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257245930},{"amount":64.35,"local_amount":171.6,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:30:30Z","rounded_local_amount":173.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270099043},{"amount":135.32,"local_amount":360.85,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:58:09Z","rounded_local_amount":365.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301456635}],"funded_date":"2011-11-22T12:35:42Z","paid_date":"2012-09-15T10:58:09Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jennifer Day","image":null}},{"id":364590,"name":"Adriana","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Adriana naci\u00f3 en la ciudad del Ollantaytambo pero vive en la misma ciudad donD. naci\u00f3, ella tiene 60 a\u00f1os D. edad y es casada y fruto D. esta uni\u00f3n tiene seis hijos.  \n\nAdriana desarrolla sus actividades cotidianas y econ\u00f3micas en la ciudad D.

Since her schooling was cut short due to a lack of financial means, she soon undertook an apprenticeship in hairdressing and braiding.  Currently, she is finished with her training and wants to get situated and on her own but doesn\u2019t have the resources.  Nevertheless, with her initiative, she is for the moment successful in doing braids at a crossroads location in order to find substantial revenues for getting situated properly and to open her own workshop.  During the Easter season, when the demand for braids from women and girls is very high, she\u2019s requesting financing for supplies of hair extensions and <i>chouchouvi<\/i>.  Her customers would be able to buy hair extensions directly from her for braiding.  Thus, she will be able to make a profit from selling hair extensions, in addition to her handiwork.  This will enable her to carve out a place for herself under the sun and to rival her friends, who have been able to pursue their schooling.   \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":303339,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty Salon","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"Hairdressing and braiding hair ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TG","country":"Togo","town":"Ts\u00e9vi\u00e9","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"8 1.166667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":22,"posted_date":"2009-04-15T02:20:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":525,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ama ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-03-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":250000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":23358.54},{"due_date":"2009-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":23708.92},{"due_date":"2009-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":24064.55},{"due_date":"2009-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":24425.52},{"due_date":"2009-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":24791.9},{"due_date":"2009-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":25163.78},{"due_date":"2009-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":25541.24},{"due_date":"2010-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":25924.36},{"due_date":"2010-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":26313.22},{"due_date":"2010-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":26707.97}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.05},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.79},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.54},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.29},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.06},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.84},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.64},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.44},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.26},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.09}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":49.05,"local_amount":23358.54,"processed_date":"2009-06-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:50:25Z","rounded_local_amount":24060.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52992798},{"amount":49.79,"local_amount":23708.92,"processed_date":"2009-07-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:55:46Z","rounded_local_amount":24420.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63214030},{"amount":50.54,"local_amount":24064.55,"processed_date":"2009-08-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:39:27Z","rounded_local_amount":24787.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73643529},{"amount":51.29,"local_amount":24425.52,"processed_date":"2009-09-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:56:57Z","rounded_local_amount":25159.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87083134},{"amount":52.06,"local_amount":24791.9,"processed_date":"2009-10-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:39:06Z","rounded_local_amount":25536.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96999391},{"amount":52.84,"local_amount":25163.78,"processed_date":"2009-11-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:01:56Z","rounded_local_amount":25919.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103844767},{"amount":53.64,"local_amount":25541.24,"processed_date":"2009-12-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T15:29:26Z","rounded_local_amount":26308.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110735849},{"amount":54.44,"local_amount":25924.36,"processed_date":"2010-01-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:11:48Z","rounded_local_amount":26702.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118125634},{"amount":55.26,"local_amount":26313.22,"processed_date":"2010-02-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:50:39Z","rounded_local_amount":27103.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123962029},{"amount":56.09,"local_amount":26707.97,"processed_date":"2010-03-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:34:37Z","rounded_local_amount":27510.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128994714}],"funded_date":"2009-04-15T16:00:40Z","paid_date":"2010-04-15T09:34:37Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Daniel Kuey","image":669418}},{"id":105577,"name":"Alumukeng Lumumba Night Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. L.

Having a rich experience in the business, she decided to launch her own a tailoring shop two years ago.\r\n\r\nAs a seamstress who has set up shop in Chisinau City, she is hoping to provide a variety of services to local clients. She employed tailors who actively participate in increasing the business despite nationwide competition. They can offer alterations on prom dresses, bridesmaid dresses, pants, jeans and mess kits. Tatiana enjoys the customers and she really enjoys meeting people and helping them to get what they need to have done.\r\n\r\nTatiana did extensive research before starting up her tailoring shop. She began producing better grades of garments with fine material and a highly qualified workman team. A good quality sewing machine will be her biggest start-up expense. She decided to borrow a loan of 30,000 lei from Microinvest to buy a new sewing machine for new workers where each of them is interested in business

is 31 years old and lives with her husband and three children in the Dornogobi province of Mongolia. She and her family live together in a ger, a traditional Mongolian nomadic tent. Her son, age 8, attends a local secondary school while her daughter, age 5, attends kindergarten. Her youngest child is an 8-month-old infant who stays at home. Bolortuya owns and operates a local public bath house. These bath houses are important for local people, as many of them do not have running water with which to bathe. She began her business in 2007 and she earns between 150,000 and 200,000 tugrugs per month. While her business is doing well, it can be expensive to maintain a public bath house. Bolortuya replaced one third of her showers last year, and these repairs make it hard to expand or significantly improve her business. Because of this, she is requesting a 900,000 tugrug loan in order to make repairs and remodel her bath

They live together in their own house. \r\n\r\nFor 28 years, Samuel has grown peas, potatoes, corn, and above all, gladiolas. Just after the harvest, he takes his products to the capital where he has a market stall. He says taking his harvests to Lima is profitable, as the prices there are 100% higher. This permits him to save and to live comfortably. \r\n\r\nSamuel says that at first he did not like agriculture, but when he started his own family, he began to work the fields out of necessity. In the future, he would like to grow more, especially gladiolas, which bring good returns on a small investment. \r\n\r\nThis is Samuel\u2019s eighth loan with MFP and he promises to be punctual with each of his payments. With this money, he will buy a bag of pea seeds, several bags of manure, fertilizers, and bottles of insecticides and fungicides.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by jeffrey hersk, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":875,"image":{"id":466206,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Pea seeds, manure, fertilizers, and insecticides","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-01-08T16:30:11Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":875,"lender_count":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Samuel ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-12-30T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":875,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-29T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-29T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-29T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":2500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":875}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":875,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2010-08-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:39:25Z","rounded_local_amount":2502.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166886653}],"funded_date":"2010-01-09T21:11:23Z","paid_date":"2010-09-15T10:39:25Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"jeff hersk","image":384019}},{"id":171428,"name":"Josephin Epifania","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Josephin labora en la Alcaldia Municipal de Nueva Guinea, es madre de 3 ni\u00f1os: Lesly que estudia 5to grado de primaria, Johathan de 14 a\u00f1os en 3er a\u00f1o de secundaria y Franklin de 15 a\u00f1os estudiando el 4to as\u00f1o de secundaria; requiere financiamiento para mejorar su casa y espera contar con el apoyo de kiva para realizar este peque\u00f1o proyecto, pues desea ponerle ceramica a la casa y mejorar la cocina.

Here, everyone knows the \u201cLos Pajaritos\u201d [Little Birds] store owned by Osvaldo O. P., 42 years of age. His father started the business 30 years ago when he lost his job. He began selling household food products and miscellaneous items. At that time, Osvaldo\u2019s brother worked at the store, and Osvaldo has been in charge for the last five years. With much discipline and effort, he has managed to make a living. \r\n\r\nAlthough Los Pajaritos sells groceries and household items, on the weekends cold drinks make up the greatest volume of sales and profits, making the business profitable for the whole month. Also, the customers like that the prices are lower than those offered by the competition.\r\n\r\nOsvaldo is applying for his third loan with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo. With it, he will buy grocery items like sugar, rice, flour, canned goods, grains, and cooking oil in bulk. By buying in quantity, he can get special discounts and stock up the store. With his previous loans, he was able to get the business off the ground, as it had been stagnant due to a lack of working capital. Now, Osvaldo can offer a wide variety of products to his customers.\r\n\r\nOsvaldo\u2019s dreams and goals are to increase his income to provide for his family. For this reason, all of his loan will be invested in the store, to keep it growing. For Osvaldo, life has constant challenges. Sometimes he feels that he needs more money for things he desires, but because he has many responsibilities, he knows he must wait.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by jeffrey hersk,

They tell us that this is because during harvest time all the women go to their fields to pick lemons together.  It is located in the community of Paso Rinc\u00f3n, San Juan Bautista Tuxtepec, in the state of Oaxaca.  It has 6 members who know each other because they all live in the same town and pick lemons together.

Do\u00f1a \u201cLeo,\u201d as she\u2019s known in her community has a small corn mill that all the women in her community come to use to grind corn to make tortillas and a small plot of land that she grows lemons on.  She needs the loan to buy fertilizers and manure for her crops.  She also needs a few sacks of corn to sell at the mill.\r\n\r\nDo\u00f1a \u201cLeo\u201d wakes up every day at 5am to open the mill and grind corn for her customers.  The mill is located in her house.  She hopes in the future to buy a new mill because the one she has breaks down sometimes.  Leonarda is a very cheerful woman who very much wants to work.\r\n\r\nMrs. Angelina P. O., 67, is another member of the Mujeres Unidas group.  She only got to third grade.  Angelina lives just with her 10 year old grandson who is in fifth grade.  She is a lemon farmer and needs the loan to buy fertilizers and manure for her crops.\r\n\r\nDo\u00f1a \u201cGela,\u201d as she\u2019s called by her friends, tells us that December is the month when profits from the lemons are highest because lemons are scarce then due to the cold.  Her farm plot is 200 meters from her house.  She hopes that her grandson will be able to go to the university in the future to become a great engineer.\r\n\r\nThe other four members are: Rosa Elvira M. P., Nelly Marisol M.

Twenty years ago, she arrived in Cartagena de Indias from the city of Amurallada in search of a better future.  Elizabeth wanted so much to study in order to become a professional, but she had difficulty gaining admission into the university.  Her friends recommended that she learn how to sew and now she says that she is happy that she made that decision.  Elizabeth has excelled because the experience she has gained as an independent entrepreneur allows her to generate her own income for covering the household expenses.  At the moment, Elizabeth also sells a variety of merchandise through specialized catalogs.

This is 40 years old Esili M. from Kyela, married with five children between the ages of 12 and 25. Esili has been running a rice business since 2004. Working at the business for 9-12 hours per day, 6 days per week, she currently earns about $100 a month and is now requesting a loan of $375 in order to purchase rice in bulk. In the future, she plans to increase the variety of crops she sells. Esili thanks you for your support!\r\n\r\nABOUT SELFINA:\r\n\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets; thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":303367,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To purchase rice in bulk.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Kyela","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-9.583333 33.85","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-04-14T18:30:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Esili M.

In addition, her house has six rooms which she has rented for the last year; she does this to help her husband defray household expenses.

She lives with her husband in a community called Hern\u00e1ndez, which is in Los Chiles, Alajuela province.  This community is noted for its mountains, great landscapes, and high humidity; in addition, it is on the road very close to the northern border of our country.  Major economic activities are ranching and agriculture.  Specifically, they grow basic grains, tubers and oranges.\r\n\r\nSince she was a girl, Keila rose every day at 4:30 in the morning to milk the family cows because dairy farming has always been a part of her life.  She assures us that there is plenty of demand in her community for the milk of her cows, and, indeed, her parents used dairy farming to support their family.  Now, Kelia wishes to have her own business, and with more cows, she would be able to increase production and take advantage of her experience and skill.\r\n\r\nFor this reason, Kelia wishes to obtain a small loan of 641,000 colones ($1,200), with which she will buy five more cows and expand her business.  She hopes that this expansion will allow her to buy the small house of her dreams.\r\n\r\nKelia is a member of the Empresa de Cr\u00e9dito Comunal Unidos por un Desarrollo (Group of Communal Credit United for Development), one of 100 member organizations of EDESA in Costa Rica.  This is her second loan, and she hopes to prosper personally and economically.   <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jeff Schell, Kiva

She earns her living by operating three business ventures:  a general store, farming and a pig fattening business. Her husband, Rodrigo C., who is 52 years old, works as a farmer to earn his living and also helps in his wife's business activities.  They have nine children who are 11 to  29 years old. \r\n\r\nMarrieta joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2007 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past six loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Marrieta has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 14,500 PHP helped her earn a monthly profit of approximately $214, raising the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 7th cycle loan, she is borrowing 20,000 PHP, which she intends to use to buy feed for the pigs and inventory for the general store so that she can continue to save up for the future expansion of her business. Marrieta C. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Every day she distributes her products from very early in the morning.  She takes charge of distributing in the village where they live while her husband leaves on his bicycle to distribute their products in the nearby towns such as Santiago and San Lucas.  In this way he does not generate additional expenses for transportation.  Now she relies on twelve cows and two young calves.  She works as a group with her husband who helps to milk the cows and to feed them every day.  They do not worry about the space for their animals since they have an extensive plot of land that is at the rear part of their house in order to be able to take care of their stock better.  She has been performing this work already for a little over 10 years, by which she has developed an extensive knowledge of the work.  Now she needs another loan to buy another cow to extend the production of milk and cheese, since, as she says, thanks to God they already have a clientele to which they supply their products.

It is here we find Dalia. She is 45, married and has five children, two of whom are adults and the youngest three are ages 13, 7 and 3 and in school. Her husband works at a mechanic's shop. Dalia makes a living raising chickens and pigs on the small farm she has at her house. She tells us she gets up to 100 chickens a season, which she buys when they're little at a commercial center in the village and then raises them for a time until they're ready to sell. She sells the birds out of her home to people who come there and if not she plucks them and takes them to the market to sell to the local merchants. Her husband takes care of the pigs and then they sell the meat out of their home to neighbors and acquaintances. Dalia tells us that she has six years of experience with this job. She plans to use the loan to purchase chickens as well as feed and medicines for both the chickens and the pigs to ensure they have a good development. She has been with the community bank for eight years and she enjoys it because the loans have helped her a lot. Her goals are to keep making headway and to have good health."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":860494,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase chickens as well as feed and medicine for chickens and pigs.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Portoviejo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2011-09-01T01:00:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":775,"lender_count":26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Dalia Asunci\u00f3n","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-08-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":770,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":96.25},{"due_date":"2011-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":96.25},{"due_date":"2011-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":96.25},{"due_date":"2011-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":96.25},{"due_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","amount":96.25},{"due_date":"2011-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":96.25},{"due_date":"2011-11-28T08:00:00Z","amount":96.25},{"due_date":"2011-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":96.25}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.88},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.87},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":96.88},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":96.87},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":96.88},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":96.87},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":96.88},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":96.87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":193.75,"local_amount":192.5,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:04:04Z","rounded_local_amount":193.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232797943},{"amount":290.63,"local_amount":288.75,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:15:15Z","rounded_local_amount":290.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238609035},{"amount":193.75,"local_amount":192.5,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:53:27Z","rounded_local_amount":193.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244563305},{"amount":96.87,"local_amount":96.25,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:04:26Z","rounded_local_amount":96.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250774280}],"funded_date":"2011-09-06T12:48:45Z","paid_date":"2012-01-15T10:04:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Marty Greenstein","image":null}},{"id":335916,"name":"Kayelye Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Mme Salamata est la repr\u00e9sentante du groupe KAYELYE.

She now has 4 children and since then she has dedicated herself to different occupations and activities with the help her life long companion, her husband.  Five years ago she decided to dedicate herself to the sale of packaging, and products that she distributed and offered exclusively during the times of fairs in different towns and to villagers that lie around the city.  She started selling in small quantities.  Little by little due to the good service she provided and her charismatic character she continued increasing the quantity of her clients, therefore increasing her income for her home.  In addition to this activity, the days she has free she dedicates herself to offering sewing services and the sale of chocolates.  This generates an additional income for the education of her children.  What Mrs. Lourde hopes is to have a packaging wholesale distribution store.  This work would permit her to be much more close to her family, generate more income, and offer them a better quality of life.  This is why Mrs. Laura is soliciting a loan of $425 dollars, money that she will use to refurbish the location she is trying to open for the packaging wholesale distribution store, and she is promising to pay back the loan in 6 months.  \r\n<p> <b>Translated from Spanish by James Lombardo, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p> \r\nLa se\u00f1ora laura actualmente tiene  41 a\u00f1os form\u00f3 su familia a la edad de 19 y fruto del matrimonio ahora tiene 4 hijos, desde entonces se dedic\u00f3  a diversas  ocupaciones y actividades siempre con el apoyo de su compa\u00f1ero de toda la vida, su esposo.Hace ya 5 a\u00f1os decidi\u00f3  dedicarse a la venta de abarrotes, productos que distribu\u00eda y ofrec\u00eda exclusivamente en los d\u00edas de feria  por los diferentes pueblos  aleda\u00f1os a la ciudad donde radica, empez\u00f3 vendiendo en peque\u00f1as cantidades y poco a poco por la buena atenci\u00f3n que brindaba  y su car\u00e1cter carism\u00e1tico  fue incrementando la cantidad de  clientes y por ende aumentando los ingresos  econ\u00f3micos para su hogar \r\nadicionalmente a esta actividad  los d\u00edas  en los que dispone de m\u00e1s tiempo se  dedica a ofrecer  los servicios  de costura y venta de chocolates trabajo que le genera un ingreso adicional  para la educaci\u00f3n de sus hijos.

They have various businesses, among others selling cloth, high quality \"pagnes\" (lengths of brightly colored African print cloth) and damask fabric, fruit, firewood, dyed products, etc. <P>\r\n\r\nWith this new loan they expect to buy 3 wagonloads of firewood, 7 bolts of \"pagnes\", 5 outfits made out of damask, 6 stalks of bananas, 10 baskets of fruit, 20 cloth suits and 4 packs of coloring and ingredients for doing dyeing. They buy their goods at the market in Bamako, in M\u00e9dine in the town of Sikasso and surrounding neighborhoods. <P>\r\n\r\nThe merchandise is sold in the various markets of Sikasso and out of their families to a clientele composed of men and women, mostly for cash. They do their dyeing in their families' homes. They each expect to make an average monthly of 22,500 F CFA of which part will be used for family needs and the rest reinvested in their businesses. <P>\r\n\r\nThe ambition of some of the women of the Danaya group is to be able to buy a lot on which to build a house; other members would like to start up businesses on their own. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Teresa Kramer, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1525,"image":{"id":312205,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"purchase of various articles for re-sale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sikasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.316667 -5.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:16Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1525,"lender_count":55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Iya ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sanata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mariam ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mariam ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-04-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":750000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2009-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2009-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2009-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2009-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2009-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":125000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":254.17},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":254.17},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":254.17},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":254.17},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":254.17},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":254.15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":508.33,"local_amount":250000,"processed_date":"2009-06-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:23:08Z","rounded_local_amount":253945.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53020239},{"amount":254.18,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2009-07-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T19:20:35Z","rounded_local_amount":126972.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63242995},{"amount":254.17,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2009-08-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T22:43:53Z","rounded_local_amount":126972.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73678774},{"amount":254.17,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2009-09-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T03:57:00Z","rounded_local_amount":126972.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87112607},{"amount":254.15,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2009-10-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T07:09:56Z","rounded_local_amount":126972.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97028172}],"funded_date":"2009-06-16T16:02:40Z","paid_date":"2009-11-16T07:09:56Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":109705,"name":"Rosina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rosina O. is married and has three children.

trabaja transportando carga y pasajeros en su mototaxi. El nos comenta que empez\u00f3 alquilando mototaxis y que con sus ahorros pudo adquirir la suya hace cuatro a\u00f1os. Usualmente trabaja dentro de la ciudad aunque a veces tambi\u00e9n en rutas que unen la ciudad con sus caser\u00edos aleda\u00f1os.\n\nPor otro lado trabaja eventualmente como obrero. El es consciente de que si quiere ver a su familia progresar tiene que dar todo de si para sacarlos adelante. El continuo uso otorgado a su veh\u00edculo ha hecho que presenta algunas fallas que requieran de reparacion urgente, por ello se encuentra solcitando a Edpyme Alternativa un cr\u00e9dito de 800 nuevos soles.\n\nElvis es un padre honrado, empe\u00f1oso y trabajador. Su m\u00e1s grande anhelo es poder instalar una bodega en su casa para brindarle a su familia ingresos estables con los cuales puedan mantenerse. Ya ha trabajado anteriormente con nosotros y ha demostrado puntualidad y responsabilidad al momento de asumir sus cuotas.\n","en":"Elvis, 27, lives with his wife and their two children.  He has a three year old and a one year old.  They live in the Paij\u00e1n distict, Ascope province, in the La Libertad area.  It is located three hours from the city of Chiclayo.\r\n\r\nHe has worked transporting cargo and passengers in his \u201cmototaxi\u201d (three wheeled motorized vehicle) for ten years.  He tells us that he started by renting mototaxis.  Four years ago he was able to get his own with his savings.  He usually works within the city, although at times he also works routes that run from the city to the neighboring areas.\r\n\r\nHe sometimes works as a workman.  He is aware of the fact that if he wants to see his family progress, he needs to give all of himself to get them ahead.  The continual use of his vehicle has caused some defects that need to be repaired urgently.  That is why he is asking Edpyme Alternativa for a loan for 800 PEN.\r\n\r\nElvis is an honest and hard-working father.  His greatest desire is to be able to set up a convenience store in his house in order to give his family stable income to be able to support themselves.  He has worked with us previously, and he has demonstrated punctuality and responsibility with his payments.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":477170,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Transportation","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"Pay expenses of repair and maintenance for his vehicle","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Paijan -
