This group is composed of 4 members who all know each other and are neighbors. Gabriela A. Garc\u00e9s is a member of the group. She is 39-years-old and lives in a common law marriage. Her husband works in the fields. She completed her studies up until the 3rd year of secondary school and she has her secondary school certificate. She has two sons named Cesar (15-years-old and in secondary school) and Miguel \u00c1ngel (8-years-old and in 2nd grade). She has requested a loan to buy fertilizer to grow corn as well as to plant corn. On the weekends, she sells corn, chicarrones [pork rinds], and chicken feet.\r\n\r\nShe buys her merchandise in the Cuautla supply center and in the main squares of Tlayecac and Yautepec. She began this business 9 years ago. She did not know how to do anything but necessity made her work and since none of her neighbors were selling, she decided to sell corn and chicharrones. In the beginning she sold very little, but now people buy more from her. The majority of people in the town plant corn and although her sales decrease on the weekends during corn harvest season, she sells corn in the town centers. Her business is located in her home in San Andr\u00e9s Cuauhtempan, Tlayacapan. She considers this business important because each week it helps her with family expenses such as food and milk as well as school expenses for her children. She is not lacking the most necessary items. The most gratifying thing for her is serving her customers because it distracts her. When she's not selling, she feels sad. Her customers are her neighbors and residents of other neighboring communities that come to buy her corn. She uses her business earnings to buy school materials and uniforms for her sons. With her earnings, she improves the quality of the food that she gives to her family.\r\n\r\nGabriela is planning to expand her business, since she would like to sell sweets and cakes, and wants to open a location in a room that she plans to set up, with a door that opens out to the street. She wants to put up a ceiling and set everything up so that it's an attractive place. She plans to achieve this with the loans since she pays them little by little. This business has helped her family in the past and it continues to help them. She does not plan to stop and wants to continue saving for when she is older. \"Children live their lives and do not take care of their parents once they're grown,\" Gabriela tells us.\r\n\r\nShe is very happy with this loan because they approved her. She wants her sons to pursue their careers or technical vocations. San Andr\u00e9s Cuauhtempan, Tlayacapan is a town with a cold climate. They are still planting and there is a festival in San Andr\u00e9s on November 30th. All the families make food and expect visits from people who come from other towns.

Her goal is to continue investing in the business so that she can establish a steady source of income.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jere Wiseman, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":532050,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Catering","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Working capital","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Leon","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.435556 -86.879444","type":"point"}},"partner_id":96,"posted_date":"2010-04-30T16:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":750,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alma Nubia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-04-05T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":16000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2010-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2010-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2010-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2010-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2010-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2010-11-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2010-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2011-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2011-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2011-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2011-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":129.47,"local_amount":2761.93,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:18:26Z","rounded_local_amount":2763.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144711088},{"amount":58.12,"local_amount":1239.85,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-16T08:44:51Z","rounded_local_amount":1240.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159761539},{"amount":69.3,"local_amount":1478.42,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:16:09Z","rounded_local_amount":1479.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166848498},{"amount":55.61,"local_amount":1187.06,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-16T08:48:37Z","rounded_local_amount":1187.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172256445},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":1333.49,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-18T11:09:28Z","rounded_local_amount":1334.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177802452},{"amount":63.15,"local_amount":1347.17,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-17T11:00:30Z","rounded_local_amount":1347.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182956293},{"amount":311.85,"local_amount":6652.08,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T13:13:13Z","rounded_local_amount":6655.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188685422}],"funded_date":"2010-05-24T18:15:56Z","paid_date":"2011-01-15T13:13:13Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jere Wiseman","image":30736}},{"id":201099,"name":"Lhagvajav","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lhagvajav D., 42, lives with her husband in an apartment in Hovd province, Mongolia.

Presently, Maricel and her husband Jimmy have one child. Despite her early marriage and motherhood, Maricel is very protective of her son.

For this, it is necessary to purchase stone, sand, cement and iron. <p>\r\nIn the long run, her goal is to offer more products to her customers, achieve a better position to continue making home improvements, and help her children with school to enable them to continue preparing to be honest and good men.    \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Carrie Ting, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":202699,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Construction","sector":"Construction","themes":null,"use":"Construction of a room","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Managua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.150833 -86.268333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":98,"posted_date":"2008-09-24T05:20:22Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":275,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Isabel Cristina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-10-08T06:47:45Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":5000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":555.56},{"due_date":"2008-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":555.56},{"due_date":"2009-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":555.56},{"due_date":"2009-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":555.56},{"due_date":"2009-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":555.56},{"due_date":"2009-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":555.56},{"due_date":"2009-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":555.56},{"due_date":"2009-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":555.56},{"due_date":"2009-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":555.52}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":30.56},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":30.56},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":30.56},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":30.56},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":30.56},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.56},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.56},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.56},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.52}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":30.56,"local_amount":555.56,"processed_date":"2008-11-07T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-15T18:24:28Z","rounded_local_amount":595.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5281417},{"amount":30.56,"local_amount":555.56,"processed_date":"2008-12-07T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-15T09:55:20Z","rounded_local_amount":595.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9893244},{"amount":30.56,"local_amount":555.56,"processed_date":"2009-01-07T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T09:16:41Z","rounded_local_amount":595.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14816321},{"amount":30.56,"local_amount":555.56,"processed_date":"2009-02-07T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-15T08:18:30Z","rounded_local_amount":595.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20351028},{"amount":30.56,"local_amount":555.56,"processed_date":"2009-03-07T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T09:03:54Z","rounded_local_amount":595.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27038346},{"amount":30.55,"local_amount":555.56,"processed_date":"2009-04-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T09:39:16Z","rounded_local_amount":595.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35928649},{"amount":30.56,"local_amount":555.56,"processed_date":"2009-05-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T20:19:25Z","rounded_local_amount":595.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44383586},{"amount":30.56,"local_amount":555.56,"processed_date":"2009-06-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T16:24:18Z","rounded_local_amount":595.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52890078},{"amount":30.53,"local_amount":555.52,"processed_date":"2009-07-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T09:32:50Z","rounded_local_amount":595.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63111408}],"funded_date":"2008-09-24T06:47:45Z","paid_date":"2009-08-15T09:32:50Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Carolyn Ting","image":653228}},{"id":69163,"name":"Nurkhanim","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Nurkhanim F. is 54 years old.

Mar\u00eda le pone mucho empe\u00f1o a su trabajo por brindarle lo justo y necesario a sus hijos, los mismos que desde ya se sienten agradecidos con ella. Lo que le gusta de su trabajo es el trato directo que tiene con sus clientes con quienes comparte muchas ideas, adem\u00e1s le es muy rentable porque no s\u00f3lo tiene su puesto en el mercado, sino que tambi\u00e9n su esposo se encarga de vender los mismos art\u00edculos pero por los caser\u00edos de su zona.

They have three children who help their parents as much as possible.     Maria has been selling plastic goods from a stand in the market for 3 years.    She works hard at her business to provide for her children, and they appreciate her efforts.   What she likes about her work is that she interfaces directly with her customers, sharing ideas and conversation.   Her business does well because she not only sells from her stand in the market, but her husband is in charge of selling their plastic goods around the city as well.   This is the first loan with MFP, and with the money requested they will invest in more plastic goods to sell as well as expand their small stand in the market.  <\/p>\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Emily Charnes, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":260523,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Plastics Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To purchase more plastic goods to sell, and expand her small stand in the market","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-01-24T21:00:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":275,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-15T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":800,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":116.98},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":126.77},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":129.55},{"due_date":"2009-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":136.88},{"due_date":"2009-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":141.51},{"due_date":"2009-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":148.31}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":40.21},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":43.58},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.53},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.05},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.64},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.99}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":40.21,"local_amount":116.98,"processed_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T20:05:57Z","rounded_local_amount":128.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20423683},{"amount":43.58,"local_amount":126.77,"processed_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:37:07Z","rounded_local_amount":138.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27116952},{"amount":44.53,"local_amount":129.55,"processed_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:47:15Z","rounded_local_amount":141.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36011873},{"amount":47.05,"local_amount":136.88,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T01:02:53Z","rounded_local_amount":149.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44595471},{"amount":48.64,"local_amount":141.51,"processed_date":"2009-06-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:41:41Z","rounded_local_amount":154.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52989713},{"amount":50.99,"local_amount":148.31,"processed_date":"2009-07-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:43:06Z","rounded_local_amount":162.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63210848}],"funded_date":"2009-01-24T23:31:44Z","paid_date":"2009-08-15T16:43:06Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Emily charnes","image":51249}},{"id":89645,"name":"Oeun","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Oeun S. is 43 years old and lives with her husband in Kampong Cham, Cambodia.

The hope of Siliva and her husband is to plant without using chemical products since in the long run it impoverishes the land. For this, the couple propose to maintain and care for their lands organically, and once they harvest their fruits to offer them at the big markets in Lima. Silvia is very excited and pleased. Furthermore, she is convinced that this these kinds of products, with time, will result in very high demand and be very profitable. Silvia has been working dynamically and responsibility with her community bank. This is her second loan with Kiva partner MFP, and she has always been very good with her payments. The money she is requesting will be use to purchase fertile land that she happens to find.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Marty Greenstein, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":304156,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Purchase land","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Chanchamayo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.05 -75.316667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-04-17T04:20:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":650,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Silvia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-03-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":650}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":650,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2009-11-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:54:43Z","rounded_local_amount":2024.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103842094}],"funded_date":"2009-04-17T08:40:39Z","paid_date":"2009-12-15T13:54:43Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Marty Greenstein","image":null}},{"id":106029,"name":"Neema's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Neema Abudallah, age 26, is single with three children ages, 18, 16 and 12 years.

She then started cooking and selling food, buying and selling charcoal and selling ice.\r\n\r\nEventually, she thought of other businesses as her loanable amount in ASHI increased. Aside from her previous business she thought of raising livestock such as chickens, pigs, and cattle in their backyard. She lives in a mountainous area of the province of Antique, Philippines, and they have a wide, verdant space in their backyard that is good for raising animals. Some of these animals, after a certain period of time, will be sold and others will multiply. Her loan previously received is intended for this purpose. \r\n\r\nOut of the profit she will have in her businesses, she envisions that someday she will be able to build a stable house to shelter her family, and that she will become a successful entrepreneur someday, and she will be a mother that her children can be proud of.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":353346,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To

She has had an educational center for the last 5 years which she installed in her own home.  As a teacher, she saw that it would be appropriate to invest her knowledge in her own business, one in which she can impart to children not only academics, but human values too.  Giovanna likes her work very much; this is why she is so dedicated to it, as is her mother. They are always watchful of the needs of the children with respect to infrastructure, equipment, etc.  For this reason, she believes that she must improve the infrastructure to accommodate more students and provide more comfort for the children.

She has worked in this for 4 years and it has been very profitable.  She usually sells this beverage at the different activities in the area where she lives.  They always request her service because she is a reliable person.  Every Saturday she also goes to the local soccer field.  There are always a lot of people due to the games that they play there and she makes good sales.  Gloria hopes to keep working to consolidate her business and make it more stable in the future.  She has been thinking about tackling another parallel job but she still hasn\u2019t decided in what.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

With two years of experience, she is mastering her business and is much in demand.\r\n\r\nFatoumata, who is on her first loan, joined the loan program of the micro-finance institution Soro Yiriwaso through her mother-in-law. She intends to use her loan to buy a major quantity of merchandise for her shop. She gets her supplies in Bamako and in Bougouni. Accepting cash or credit, she makes her sales retail to a diverse and varied customer base.\r\n\r\nWith this loan, she plans on making a monthly profit of 60,000 francs CFA. With the profits, she envisions expanding her shop.\r\n\r\n

Thanks to her persistent work, Nazgul's business currently yields about 8,000 som per month from sale of milk and meat products.  In order to further grow her business, she requested a loan in the sum of 60,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company to purchase bulls for fattening up.

She hopes to scale up her farming business; however, she says that farmers are facing a great challenge occasioned by animal diseases and poor infrastructure."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":983743,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy and insure a dairy cow","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kitale","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1.016667 35","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2012-01-17T02:30:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Grace","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-12-26T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":31200,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":2243.06},{"due_date":"2012-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":2303.06},{"due_date":"2012-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":2363.06},{"due_date":"2012-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":2426.06},{"due_date":"2012-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":2490.06},{"due_date":"2012-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":2556.06},{"due_date":"2012-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":2623.06},{"due_date":"2012-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":2693.06},{"due_date":"2012-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":2764.06},{"due_date":"2012-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":2837.06},{"due_date":"2012-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":2912.06},{"due_date":"2012-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":2989.34}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.96},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.68},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.4},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.16},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.93},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.72},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.53},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.37},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.22},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.1},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.93}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":36.9,"local_amount":3070,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T10:53:06Z","rounded_local_amount":3213.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257226162},{"amount":27.96,"local_amount":2326.43,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-16T08:21:28Z","rounded_local_amount":2435.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263364397},{"amount":28.7,"local_amount":2387.93,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-16T08:17:04Z","rounded_local_amount":2499.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270276156},{"amount":29.82,"local_amount":2481.05,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-16T08:46:00Z","rounded_local_amount":2597.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276904741},{"amount":30.61,"local_amount":2546.63,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-16T08:36:32Z","rounded_local_amount":2666,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283524234},{"amount":31.42,"local_amount":2613.94,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-16T08:24:58Z","rounded_local_amount":2736.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287612872},{"amount":32.25,"local_amount":2683.04,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-16T08:55:56Z","rounded_local_amount":2808.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294599738},{"amount":33.1,"local_amount":2753.96,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:38:45Z","rounded_local_amount":2883.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301435113},{"amount":34.05,"local_amount":2832.76,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:18:25Z","rounded_local_amount":2965.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308435374},{"amount":90.19,"local_amount":7504.26,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-17T10:08:47Z","rounded_local_amount":7856.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315823897}],"funded_date":"2012-01-17T04:08:22Z","paid_date":"2012-11-17T10:08:47Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sharon K-S","image":1103477}},{"id":882169,"name":"Faustine","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Faustine aged 36 years.

husband's income was not sufficient to support their growing family. Slowly but surely the word got around and the customers started to come. Now her corner store is firmly established but it is not quite enough to make ends meet so in the afternoons she sells sweet drinks made of corn called <i>atol<\/i> and also lunch food called <i>tostados<\/i>. She works hard from early morning to late at night caring for her family, preparing the food for the day and running the two businesses. She is one busy person.\r\n<p>\r\nMaria also cares for her oldest daughter (age 15), who suffers from cerebral palsy resulting in mental and physical disability as well as speech problems. The daughter no longer receives treatment at the Fundabien Institution so the burden falls on Maria's shoulders Sometime she gets depressed and feels overwhelmed. But she has 6 other children that need her love and care, so she carries on the best she can. Her dream is to make sure the rest of the children get an education so they can get a good start in life. So she tends the store in the morning and sells her prepared food in the afternoon  and cares for her family. Every day is a struggle; but, for the sake of her family, she fights on knowing someday things will get better.\r\n<p>\r\nInterviewed by Lucia Tunay Ixcol<br\/>\r\nWritten by Nancy Lewis and Randy Fay, Kiva Fellows"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":71166,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Purchase supplies for the store","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GT","country":"Guatemala","town":"San Pedro Yepocapa, Chimaltenango","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"14.504167 -90.956944","type":"point"}},"partner_id":55,"posted_date":"2007-10-01T23:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":675,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Magdalena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-10-16T00:50:21Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":675,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2007-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2008-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2008-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2008-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2008-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2008-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2008-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2008-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":75}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2008-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2008-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":75,"local_amount":75,"processed_date":"2007-11-16T10:23:08Z","settlement_date":"2008-07-16T09:31:15Z","rounded_local_amount":75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":82337},{"amount":75,"local_amount":75,"processed_date":"2007-12-16T10:24:50Z","settlement_date":"2008-07-16T09:31:15Z","rounded_local_amount":75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97975},{"amount":75,"local_amount":75,"processed_date":"2008-01-16T10:15:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-07-16T09:31:15Z","rounded_local_amount":75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":116529},{"amount":75,"local_amount":75,"processed_date":"2008-02-16T10:15:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-07-16T09:31:15Z","rounded_local_amount":75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136364},{"amount":75,"local_amount":75,"processed_date":"2008-03-16T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-07-16T09:31:15Z","rounded_local_amount":75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159083},{"amount":75,"local_amount":75,"processed_date":"2008-04-16T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-07-16T09:31:15Z","rounded_local_amount":75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":183846},{"amount":75,"local_amount":75,"processed_date":"2008-05-16T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-07-16T09:31:15Z","rounded_local_amount":75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211408},{"amount":75,"local_amount":75,"processed_date":"2008-06-16T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-07-16T09:31:15Z","rounded_local_amount":75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":239557},{"amount":75,"local_amount":75,"processed_date":"2008-07-16T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-07-16T09:31:15Z","rounded_local_amount":75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":268485}],"funded_date":"2007-10-02T00:50:21Z","paid_date":"2008-07-16T09:07:15Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":24102,"name":"Felicita","description":{"languages":["es"],"texts":{"es":"Mrs. Felicita belongs to Comunal Bank Sol Naciente (Rising Sun),  at Jr. F.

Mart\u00ednez is 39 years old and married without children.  Her husband works as a carpenter in his own workshop-- his goals are to improve the family's financial situation through his work, as it is the only way he has been able to provide for his wife.  Claudia would like to open a beauty salon with all of the necessary amenities to satisfy her clients.  She additionally dreams of offering beauty-technician classes to those with limited resources who would otherwise not be able to pursue the career professionally.  Also, Claudia would like to have a child with whom to  share her life and professional experiences.  \r\n\r\nClaudia sells cosmetic products and her services as a beauty technician.  Her business is a traveling one, as she sells her products door-to-door and visits her clients at their homes.  Claudia began this business 12 years ago after learning the trade of beauty technician.  She began by visiting her clients at their homes, and later when offered the opportunity to work in a salon owned by a family friend she worked there as well.  Working at the salon exposed Claudia to a greater flow of clients.  \r\n\r\nClaudia is not only a micoentrepreneur, but also a professional who contributes to the satisfaction and happiness of others.  She also contributes to supporting her family.  The loan that she is requesting is to finance an investment in her inventory of beauty products so that she can have a wider variety of colors to offer to her clients.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from

Animal husbandry produces a good income, but there is a long wait for the animal to grow to marketable size. Because of that Abdurashid became a truck driver and started carrying fruits, vegetables and other freight. He began to work with Microinvest a few days ago.

Desde muy joven se dedica a las labores agr\u00edcolas en terrenos alquilados ubicados de 35 a 40 minutos de su casa en carro, pero los d\u00edas que no ingresan los autos, camina de 90 a 100 minutos hasta llegar a su chacra. Para Armando, tanto la siembra de pl\u00e1tanos, como de caf\u00e9, son igual de rentables, porque la producci\u00f3n del primero le genera ingresos cada 15 d\u00edas, mientras que el otro es una vez al a\u00f1o, pero acumula muy buenas ganancias que al dividirlas entre 12 meses resulta igual de ingresos que los pl\u00e1tanos. Por ello, estos dos cultivos son indispensables en sus chacras y se dedica a abonarlos y quitar las malezas las veces que requiera. Armando se siente muy motivado porque tiene una esposa muy trabajadora que lo apoya en cada uno de sus labores; y sus planes a futuro son de sembrar alternadamente diversos productos, hasta convertirse en latifundistas, para que sus hijos puedan tener y contar con todos los bienes necesarios, en aras de mejorar su calidad de vida. Armando es una persona muy inquieta y bromista con los dem\u00e1s integrantes de su banco comunal, este es su 2do pr\u00e9stamo con MFP donde viene trabajando responsablemente con cada uno de sus obligaciones. El dinero que solicita es para mandar a limpiar cada uno de sus cultivos, que por cada cuadra, cobran entre 350 a 400 soles.","en":"Armando is 36 years old and has lived with his common law wife for the past 13 years.  They have 5 children together.  Since he was young he has worked in agriculture, working on rented land that is located 35-40 minutes driving distance from his home.  On days that cars cannot pass through, he walks 90 or 100 minutes to get to his fields.  For Armando, raising both bananas and coffee are both profitable, because the production of the bananas generates income every 15 days, while coffee gives a profit once a year.  His coffee crop provides enough earnings that when he divides it out over 12 months, it ends up giving the same profit as his bananas.  Because of this, these two crops are indispensable for his fields and he works hard to fertilize them and protect them from harm.  Armando is very motivated because he has a wife who is also very hardworking, who supports him in his work.  His plans for the future are to alternate planting different crops and to eventually become landowners, so his children can count on having what they need, and to improve their quality of life.   Armando is a restless person and likes to joke around with the other members of his community bank.  This is his 2nd loan with MFP and  he has been responsible with all of his commitments.  The loan money will be used to clean his fields, because for each block he is charged 350-400 soles.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Rachel Crouch, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":304214,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"cleaning up his fields","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Chanchamayo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.05 -75.316667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-04-17T16:30:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":175,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Armando","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-03-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":175}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":175,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2009-11-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:54:45Z","rounded_local_amount":545.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103842097}],"funded_date":"2009-04-17T18:28:24Z","paid_date":"2009-12-15T13:54:45Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Rachel Crouch","image":59003}},{"id":106045,"name":"Leonora","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Leonora es socia del Banco Comunal Amaquella que significa No Seas Flojo en quechua.\nLeonora es casada, tiene 49 a\u00f1os y 4 hijos, Leonora tiene una tienda en un local alquilado en donD. venD. abarrotes en general, actividad que realiza todos los d\u00edas con la ayuda eventual D. sus hijos.\nLeonora necesita un pr\u00e9stamo D. 2100 dinero que ser\u00e1 invertido en la compra D. arroz, aceite, az\u00facar.\nLos sue\u00f1os D.

She would like her business to be stable so she can offer her children stability. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Shelly Hubman, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":343180,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"capital de trabajo","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Leon","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.435556 -86.879444","type":"point"}},"partner_id":96,"posted_date":"2009-07-01T19:20:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":250,"lender_count":6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lucia Ramona ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-05-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":4500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":450},{"due_date":"2009-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":450},{"due_date":"2009-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":450},{"due_date":"2009-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":450},{"due_date":"2009-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":450},{"due_date":"2009-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":450},{"due_date":"2009-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":450},{"due_date":"2010-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":450},{"due_date":"2010-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":450},{"due_date":"2010-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":450}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":50,"local_amount":900,"processed_date":"2009-07-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-05T09:30:54Z","rounded_local_amount":955.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":66055729},{"amount":25,"local_amount":450,"processed_date":"2009-08-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T15:29:56Z","rounded_local_amount":477.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73599953},{"amount":25,"local_amount":450,"processed_date":"2009-09-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T17:58:02Z","rounded_local_amount":477.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87035842},{"amount":25.99,"local_amount":467.81,"processed_date":"2009-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T21:42:19Z","rounded_local_amount":496.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96948237},{"amount":25.18,"local_amount":453.32,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T12:33:08Z","rounded_local_amount":481.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103790167},{"amount":25.11,"local_amount":451.93,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T13:33:45Z","rounded_local_amount":480.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110680837},{"amount":25.18,"local_amount":453.21,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:35:00Z","rounded_local_amount":481.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118075373},{"amount":23.54,"local_amount":423.73,"processed_date":"2010-02-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:09:09Z","rounded_local_amount":450.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123911425},{"amount":25,"local_amount":450,"processed_date":"2010-03-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-06T07:51:06Z","rounded_local_amount":477.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128947274}],"funded_date":"2009-07-01T21:04:23Z","paid_date":"2010-05-06T07:51:06Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Shelly Hubman","image":226625}},{"id":122429,"name":"Susan","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Susan B. is from the village of Yahong,Tudela, Misamis Occidental.

Lydia is requesting a new loan of 5,000 pesos which will be used to purchase raw ingredients needed to make products for sale. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Lydia from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business. \r\n<P>\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n<P>\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n<P>\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, we created this template for our field staff to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":125,"image":{"id":392776,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

He used to work as a plumber but decided to start his own business.  He started by investing his own money but demand for his wares started to grow and he was able to increase his stock little by little.  With his earnings he supported his four children providing for their education.  As time has gone by he has managed to break even but in the last few months sales have dropped to the extent that his expenses are more than his earnings.  For this reason he needs to diversify his products and invest in something that will be more profitable like cosmetics, perfumes, billfolds, and more clothing for the Christmas season since new styles come out then and parents want to please their children buying them toys; he hopes to overcome the economic crisis this way and come out ahead in his sales.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Pomape is a rural zone dedicated mainly to agricultural labour and located in the Monsef\u00fa district, known on the national level for its tourist and religious festivities. It is located twenty minutes from the city of Chiclayo. She has worked in livestock from a very young age. She raises cows and sells the milk that they produce to a local collector who provides this product to a milk processing company. This is an important source of income for her family, so she tries to work hard to maintain the business. In order to optimize her production, she normally feeds her animals natural grass that she acquires from the local farmers. Santos wants to acquire balanced food to help her cows continue to improve the quality of their milk. This investment is very important for her business, since in this season the grass and fodder that she normally feeds them is scarce. Thus, Santos has decided to request a loan of 1000 soles from Edpyme Alternativa, which will allow her to achieve her goal. Santos has already had a loan financed on Kiva through Edpyme Alternativa and Capital Semilla. With that loan, she was able to acquire balanced food to complement the food that she normally gives her animals. It helped her to obtain a good production, an so she is very happy and grateful to the people who are working with her through Kiva."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":682466,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to acquire balanced food for her cows, to improve the quality of the milk that they produce.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Caser\u00edo Pomape - Monsef\u00fa - Chiclayo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":143,"posted_date":"2010-12-31T16:50:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Santos","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":66.69},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":73.11},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":76.33},{"due_date":"2011-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":73.52},{"due_date":"2011-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":80.84},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.91},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.55},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.78},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.67},{"due_date":"2011-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":92.35},{"due_date":"2011-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":95.95},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":98.3}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25.01},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.42},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.62},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.57},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.31},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.72},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.71},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.54},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.63},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.63},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.98},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.86}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":25.01,"local_amount":66.69,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T02:56:40Z","rounded_local_amount":70.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191410589},{"amount":27.42,"local_amount":73.11,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T08:33:00Z","rounded_local_amount":76.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":196109003},{"amount":28.62,"local_amount":76.33,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T10:47:53Z","rounded_local_amount":80.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201271164},{"amount":27.57,"local_amount":73.52,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T10:48:10Z","rounded_local_amount":77.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206137742},{"amount":61.03,"local_amount":162.75,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:01:39Z","rounded_local_amount":171.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211210269},{"amount":31.71,"local_amount":84.55,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-19T07:43:22Z","rounded_local_amount":88.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":222204805},{"amount":32.54,"local_amount":86.78,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-16T08:03:01Z","rounded_local_amount":91.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227181530},{"amount":33.63,"local_amount":89.67,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T08:44:12Z","rounded_local_amount":94.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232778586},{"amount":34.63,"local_amount":92.35,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T09:47:43Z","rounded_local_amount":97.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238583220},{"amount":72.84,"local_amount":194.25,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:42:40Z","rounded_local_amount":204.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244541531}],"funded_date":"2010-12-31T19:53:04Z","paid_date":"2011-12-15T09:42:40Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Christine Cooper","image":1766620}},{"id":266690,"name":"Zarina's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Zarina lives in Multan, which is a big city located in the Punjab province of Pakistan.

Her elder son works in a hotel for a low income while the others stay at home and don\u2019t do anything. Zarina couldn\u2019t provide them education facilities due to financial constraints.\r\n \r\nHer husband also works in a Punjabi food hotel. His income is not very satisfactory, and that\u2019s why Zarina helps her family financially by operating an embroidery business. She started this business a few years ago. In Multan, this is a very common and demanding business because people from other cities come to buy embroidered dresses and other clothes from here due to their cheap rates and good quality. She collects orders from her neighborhood clients and finishes the orders on time to earn an income. She is very good at it and wants to expand her business on larger scale.  \r\n\r\nThat\u2019s why she has applied for a loan from Kiva's partner Asasah. With the loan, she will buy embroidery material in bulk such as clothes, beads, colored thread and sketches which help her to make the embroidered dresses in good quantity and in contact with different cloth shops and boutiques. \r\n\r\nShe hopes that it will bring positive results for her business. \r\n\r\nShe is a regular loan user of Asasah and this is her 2nd loan application.

In 2012, the members of Kamkata SHG group will each plant between half and 1 acre of maize.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1250,"image":{"id":925187,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to source farming inputs such as seeds and fertilizer at low prices for the 2012 planting season","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Chwele","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2011-12-09T06:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1250,"lender_count":43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Benard","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Caine","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Edward","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Esau","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Everlyne","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Festo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"George","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Getrude","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jackson ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dorcas","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rose","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rose","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jenipher","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-11-13T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":116900,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":1250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116900}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1250}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":1250,"local_amount":116900,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-27T10:16:00Z","rounded_local_amount":118726,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315680744}],"funded_date":"2011-12-17T13:17:07Z","paid_date":"2012-11-27T10:16:00Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Paul & Rachel Norridge","image":828426}},{"id":360978,"name":"Gerges","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Gerges is a 50-year-old Lebanese married man living with his wife and four children.

She is not married yet. For almost seven years, Umeda has owned a beauty salon. Everyday she services many brides. In general, she offers bride-dresses, manicures, pedicures, make-up and hairstyles.

Umeda likes her job very much, because she likes to see the smiles of happy brides every day.   \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and with it\u2019s famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the Fourth millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He is very interested and involved, and he wants so much to forge a good future for himself. He is an artesan, having learned knitting as a small child from his father. He is very happy carrying out his work and it has brought him very many benefits, in addition to being able to cover his expenses.

Hotamdjon is 41 years old. He is married and has three children. Hotamdjon is a noble worker dedicated to raising animals, primarily cattle, which he buys and sells in the commercial city markets. This work is very agreeable to him, because raising animals is what he enjoys most. Hotamdjon requires a certain amount of money to increase the number of his cattle. His goal is to increase his livestock and thereby increase his household income, in addition to being solvent in order to continue working on buying and selling animals.    \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\"\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists, and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New Western culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Eulalia has been engaged in her business for over three years and earns approximately 1,500 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2006, Eulalia joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services. She hoped to help improve her living situation and increase her ability to engage in business activities. Eulalia has successfully repaid a previous loan of 7,000 PHP from GDMPC. This previous loan was used to additional capital for her business. Eulalia is requesting a new loan of 7,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the sixth loan taken out by Eulalia from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three units offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental.

They have eight children, but only three still live with them in their own home.  He is proud to be growing coffee, bananas, avocados, and pineapple on his own land.  Together with his loving wife and the help of his children, Sixto works each day with great effort.  He begins very early in the morning and works until late afternoon, just as he learned from his parents.  Sixto has been farming for 40 years.  To honor his family and the memory of his father, he feels he must work extremely hard to produce in both quantity and quality.  What he enjoys most is working on his land because he feels the peacefulness of the countryside.  In the future, he hopes to build a house in the city of Pichanaki and start a grocery business for when he no longer has the strength to continue farming.  Yet he continues to buy land for cultivating natural products grown in the region so that he can leave an inheritance for his children.  \r\n<p>\r\nThis is his third loan with MFP.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She may soon begin to take small orders for special events or other activities.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Hannah Lily, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":284072,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"School supplies for her two children","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":93,"posted_date":"2009-03-12T15:00:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Giovana,","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-02-23T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":315,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":78.75},{"due_date":"2009-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":78.75},{"due_date":"2009-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":78.75},{"due_date":"2009-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":78.75}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":88.88,"local_amount":86.15,"processed_date":"2009-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T17:47:27Z","rounded_local_amount":88.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27084969},{"amount":73.61,"local_amount":71.35,"processed_date":"2009-04-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-29T08:17:23Z","rounded_local_amount":73.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35978449},{"amount":162.51,"local_amount":157.5,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-02T08:03:56Z","rounded_local_amount":162.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44439337}],"funded_date":"2009-03-12T15:53:06Z","paid_date":"2009-07-02T08:03:56Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":97885,"name":"Wema Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Zarina has been a clothes seller in the Nzovwe neighborhood of Mbeya for five years.

They are workers that are looking every moment for a way to progress. With their daily efforts they hope to achieve a better future for their children. The members live in the San Isidro de Chicon Community near the city of Urubamba, in the department of Cusco. This area is known for its beautiful countryside, its agriculture and its ranches. The city of San Isidro de Chicon is located ten minutes from the city of Urubamba.\r\nFrancisca is a member of the LOS DINAMICOS DE SAN ISIDRO DE CHICON Community Bank. She is 42 years old, is married and has two children (Elvis and Ofelia) that still depend on her for support. Francisca raises small animals such as guinea pigs, pigs and ducks. She is an enterprising woman. Since she has obtained her permit from the city to raise animals she has begun this business. This woman has been a member of the Community Bank for the past year. The loan she is requesting will be used to buy more guinea pigs and for animal food.\r\nThe other members also raise young animals or they sell groceries, work in agriculture, sell dry goods or build houses. Raul works as a driver in the city.\r\nThe members are worried because sales are down because their buyers work directly in the tourist industry. The heavy rains that fell for three days in the city of Cusco caused tourists to cancel their reservations for trips to Cusco. Tourism has fallen quite a bit.\r\nThe members are thankful for the opportunity that is available and promise to pay their individual payments on time. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Esther Levandoski, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4750,"image":{"id":488961,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To expand their businesses","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Urubamba - Urubamba - Cusco","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":119,"posted_date":"2010-02-15T23:10:12Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":4750,"lender_count":143,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":" Fabiana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Inoscencia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juan Cancio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Francisca","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mario","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Melquiades","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mario Cesar","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Mario","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sergia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hilario","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Julia Alejandrina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gregoria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Florencio Raul","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dominga","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Modesta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alicia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-02-03T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":13500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":4750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":2035.27},{"due_date":"2010-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":2116.69},{"due_date":"2010-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":2201.36},{"due_date":"2010-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":2289.42},{"due_date":"2010-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":2381.01},{"due_date":"2010-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":2476.25}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":716.11},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":744.76},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":774.56},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":805.53},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":837.77},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":871.27}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":716.19,"local_amount":2035.5,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T08:19:13Z","rounded_local_amount":2042.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128905971},{"amount":744.85,"local_amount":2116.95,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T09:48:58Z","rounded_local_amount":2124.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136633441},{"amount":774.64,"local_amount":2201.6,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T08:49:08Z","rounded_local_amount":2209.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144667863},{"amount":805.64,"local_amount":2289.71,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:24:17Z","rounded_local_amount":2297.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151851525},{"amount":837.84,"local_amount":2381.22,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T10:14:19Z","rounded_local_amount":2389.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159589884},{"amount":870.84,"local_amount":2475.02,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T09:41:10Z","rounded_local_amount":2483.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166800705}],"funded_date":"2010-02-17T01:00:15Z","paid_date":"2010-09-15T09:41:10Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Esther Levandoski","image":11830}},{"id":180508,"name":"Elena","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Elena Q. is a 47-year old married woman who lives in Binucot Pob, Sta.

Elena joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1999 in the hopes that she would be able to help her husband improve the quality of life of their family. With the help of her loans from NWTF-PD she has been able to increase their family income by engaging in a general store and hog-raising business.

Her previous loan of PHP 19,500 was used to fund the operations of her general store and her hog-raising business. The loan process had a positive impact on both the business and the family\u2019s living conditions. Now she is borrowing her 11th cycle loan, amounting to PHP 19,500. She also intends to use this loan towards her general store and hog-raising businesses. Elena is working hard to achieve her dreams and aspirations for her family, which is to provide them with a brighter future and a more comfortable life.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

People of this area are used to harsh winds and frosty winters. The main occupation of majority is cattle breeding. Our group is not an exception.\r\n\r\nDamira B., the leader of this group, is the mother of three children. She is 48 and, for a living, she raises livestock for sale. At present, she is raising five sheep for sale. Her husband works in a rayon (district) electricity station. One of her sons works in a pastry shop while the other son and her husband help Damira look after the cattle. The little daughter has been fortunate enough, as her parents sent her to university in the capital.\r\n\r\nDamira strives to provide a good life for her family. Therefore she is doing her best to increase the total population of her livestock. Now, her monthly income is around $110. It is not much money but Damira is an optimistic person and believes that she will manage to improve her family\u2019s living conditions. Besides, recently they have made a major repair to their house. Now, Damira needs a loan to purchase two sheep and fuel for farming.\r\n\r\nDamira\u2019s partners:\r\n\r\nB. Aiymbubu, 60, is a widow who has raised three children. Her two sons are now farmers and actively support their mother. As for Aiymbubu, she is engaged in reselling livestock and manages to earn $85 a month. Now she needs a loan to purchase more sheep.\r\n\r\nS. Mairamkul, 49, has three children and the whole family is occupied with cattle breeding. They started this business three years ago by means of a loan and their life has greatly improved since then. Now they again need a loan to invest in increasing the total population of their livestock.\r\n\r\nT. Ishen, 56, is a widow and has three children: two daughters are married and a son is a college student. To make a living Ishen built a shop and started raising cattle. Now, she has a stable business and two sources of income. She needs this loan to purchase more sheep and a cow.\r\n\r\n\r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---<\/b>\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance, a young and ambitious socially-focused MFI in Kyrgyzstan.\r\n\r\nMol Bulak Finance is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development on the basis of the 3-Ps concept - People (building human capital and taking care of its customers and the society as well), Profit (to be profitable in order to grow further) and the Planet (taking care of the environment).

Today, both businesses have become stable. Erdenebat is a talkative and open-minded man. He will save enough money to purchase an apartment with 2-3 rooms for his family, in the future. Erdenebat is requesting a 1,000,000 MNT loan in order to increase his working capital. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":626059,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"To buy more clothes.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MN","country":"Mongolia","town":"Bayanhongor","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"46 105","type":"point"}},"partner_id":116,"posted_date":"2010-10-25T19:00:11Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":800,"lender_count":27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Erdenebat","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-10-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MNT","disbursal_amount":1000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2010-12-27T08:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2011-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2011-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2011-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2011-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2011-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2011-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2011-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2011-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2011-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2011-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.66},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.66},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.66},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.66},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":66.77,"local_amount":83466.67,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T16:01:12Z","rounded_local_amount":85803.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182626728},{"amount":66.56,"local_amount":83214.38,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T15:06:48Z","rounded_local_amount":85544.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188764637},{"amount":66.78,"local_amount":83472.54,"processed_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-17T01:35:10Z","rounded_local_amount":85809.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191613467},{"amount":66.7,"local_amount":83378.65,"processed_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T09:10:38Z","rounded_local_amount":85713.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":196057609},{"amount":66.55,"local_amount":83193.16,"processed_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-16T08:31:41Z","rounded_local_amount":85522.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201495835},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":83337.51,"processed_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-21T07:54:21Z","rounded_local_amount":85670.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206930667},{"amount":66.8,"local_amount":83501.45,"processed_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-24T08:02:49Z","rounded_local_amount":85839.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":212422736},{"amount":66.77,"local_amount":83464.18,"processed_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-11T08:00:59Z","rounded_local_amount":85801.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":217258478},{"amount":66.44,"local_amount":83052.21,"processed_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-16T08:21:43Z","rounded_local_amount":85377.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221899960},{"amount":66.63,"local_amount":83252.55,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-17T08:24:29Z","rounded_local_amount":85583.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227127900},{"amount":133.33,"local_amount":166666.7,"processed_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-20T08:16:41Z","rounded_local_amount":171333.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":233405451}],"funded_date":"2010-10-28T23:44:42Z","paid_date":"2011-10-20T08:16:41Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Brett & Margaret Silberg","image":null}},{"id":246237,"name":"Joy","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Joy S. is from Gango, Ozamiz City.

Suddenly, she was unsure of what she could do for a living in her new home. \u201cThere are so many opportunities in this country, but not knowing English was a huge barrier. Where could I work if I didn\u2019t speak the language?\u201d \n \nEager to continue working with children, Libia began volunteering with preschool and afterschool programs in San Francisco as a childcare provider and Spanish teacher. A coworker, noticing Libia\u2019s expertise, soon suggested she open her own in-home childcare business. \u201cI didn\u2019t even know such a thing existed!\u201d, Libia recalled. \n \nLibia\u2019s in-home childcare center, called \"Nest Garden Heart\", has now been in business for nearly 15 years and Libia is a pillar in her community. \u201cIt is amazing to work with children and to be able to watch them grow,\u201d says Libia. \u201cMany of them first come to my home when they\u2019re as young as 2 months old, and stay until they are ready to go to preschool. I\u2019m there as they take their first steps and get their first teeth.\u201d \n \nNest Garden Heart offers a wide variety of activities and resources to help the children learn and grow, including areas dedicated to reading, music, theater and costumes, and art. This encouraging educational environment is particularly important given that many of the children in her care are special needs or at-risk youth who come to Nest Garden Heart via San Francisco family service agencies. Libia also offers overnight childcare to parents who work the night-shift and need a safe space to leave their children.  \n \nSince Libia received her first loan from Opportunity Fund in 2006, she has used two microloans to renovate her backyard and set up a garden and play space. Now, with a loan Libia will be able to purchase new equipment and furniture designed for special needs children, replace worn-out and missing educational supplies, and ensure that her small business continues to be a success.\n\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":6200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":6200,"image":{"id":714110,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Child

What she enjoys the most about her work is advising her customers about the products that will have the best effects on their maladies.  She\u2019s been in business four years and considers the most difficult part convincing her customers about the importance of her products.  Even so, she continues firm in her goals.\r\n\r\nWith support from the loan, she\u2019ll ask her suppliers to leave a larger volume of natural products.  In time, she\u2019d like to open a store exclusively dedicated to the natural products.\r\n\r\nThis will be her 13th loan with MFP.  She hopes to have support from lenders to continue growing and commits to be punctual with her installment payments like she\u2019s been in prior loans because she wants to be able to access future loans.  She is very participative in the communal bank.  She will use the requested 2000 new soles to buy more natural products that she hopes to use to better stock her sales stand.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":820121,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy more natural products to stock her store.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-07-24T03:00:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Norma ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-06-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":193.53},{"due_date":"2011-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":198.8},{"due_date":"2011-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":206.05},{"due_date":"2011-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":213.58},{"due_date":"2011-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":222.2},{"due_date":"2011-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":230.03},{"due_date":"2012-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":235.81}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.96},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.89},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.56},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":78.31},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81.47},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":84.35},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":86.46}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":143.85,"local_amount":392.33,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-17T08:13:36Z","rounded_local_amount":393.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227350773},{"amount":75.56,"local_amount":206.05,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:48:12Z","rounded_local_amount":206.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232851137},{"amount":78.31,"local_amount":213.58,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:57:40Z","rounded_local_amount":214.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238666313},{"amount":81.47,"local_amount":222.2,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:43:11Z","rounded_local_amount":223.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244621471},{"amount":84.35,"local_amount":230.03,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:50:58Z","rounded_local_amount":230.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250835544},{"amount":86.46,"local_amount":235.81,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:17:30Z","rounded_local_amount":236.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257245302}],"funded_date":"2011-08-19T00:57:34Z","paid_date":"2012-02-15T11:17:30Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":324097,"name":"Kisanga Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Hamdan, who is in his mid 50s, is married and has four children who go to school and college.
