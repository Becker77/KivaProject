She is married to Edwin, a driver.  Together they work hard for a safe and secure future for themselves and their family.\r\n\r\nElena operates a meat business. Live pigs or meat are bought directly from hog raisers. The live pigs are then slaughtered, and then the meat is sold to members of the immediate community. Elena has many patrons who buy the cut meat and then sell it from their respective market stalls. There are many patrons who prefer Elena\u2019s products because they are assured of its freshness and cleanliness. It is also a little cheaper to buy meat from an independent meat shop than the ones in the market who sometimes use the services of professional slaughterhouses for their meat. The cost of slaughter is added to the final price of the cut meat and passed along to the customers. Thus, Elena has many patrons who regularly anticipate her meat. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of $10 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting an 11,000 PHP loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy live pigs to be slaughtered and sold every day. She also will invest a portion of the loan to buy pork, poultry and beef from other raisers.  She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.\r\n  \r\nElena hopes that her business will continue to be successful, just as she fervently hopes that her children will be able to graduate one day, and be finished with their studies. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay Micro Finance loans.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":665615,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Butcher

Rasonable Group's","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Rosalie R. is from the Barangay of Carmen Annex, Ozamiz City, Misamis Occidental. Rosalie is the group leader of a two-member group loan offered by  Paglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC). While both members of the group would receive an individual loan, they would be collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group member if one of them is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is Rosalie R.\u2019s Group. <p>\r\n\r\nRosalie is a married, 35-year-old woman who is blessed with one school-age child. To earn a living, she is engaged in the agriculture industry. Specifically, she produces seaweed (locally known as guso) for re-sale purposes. She has been engaged in this line of business for five years, and she typically earns an average of no less than 5,000 PHP per month from these activities. <p>\r\n\r\nIn 2011, Rosalie joined PMPC to gain access to financial services. By doing so, she hopes to be better able to engage in business activities and to thereby improve her family's standard of living. Rosalie is an active member of PMPC under the PDP-LP, a microfinance program that reaches out to rural communities. She is now requesting her first loan through PMP, in the amount of 5,000 PHP ($125), which would be used to finance production of her guso. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business as a result of the loan to improve her family's living conditions. For instance, she would like to use the additional revenue to meet their family's basic needs, save for the future, repay the loan, and expand her business. <p>\r\n\r\nAbout PMPC: PMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen

With the profits from this season\u2019s harvest, she plans to send her children to school.\r\n\r\nWith this loan, Yusula\u2019s Group will be able to plant a total of 6.5 acres of land and purchase a total of 13 solar lights.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n"}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1803237,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Green","Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to purchase a solar light and gain access to cost efficient hybrid seeds and fertilizer for maize cultivation.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Matete","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1500,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Yusula","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Emily","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rose","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mary","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"John","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Robert","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rael J","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"David","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Pius","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alice","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Boaz","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"David","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Chesumen K","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-03-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":139760,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":1500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":139760}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1500}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Susan Grantham","image":456803}},{"id":992458,"name":"Maryori Yanitza","description":{"languages":["es"],"texts":{"es":"Maryori es una joven de 24 a\u00f1os de edad,soltera e hija de padres luchadores que viven en las afueras de la ciudad su padre se dedica al trabajo de seguridad y su madre es ama de casa, tiene un hermano que trabaja como electricista y apoya a sus padres.

Today Ketut Karsi only raise 1 mother pig. Food given was also simple, from banana tree trunk that was cooked and then mixed with rice shells fed twice a day morning and evenings. Usually pregnancy time for pigs are only 3 months, and it could produce 6 to 8 piglets. raising for 6 months cost about Rp400,00 (about US$44). After it was felt large enough, that is usually 3 months raising piglets, they are ready to be sold. That could reach up to Rp 2,000,000 (about $220) each harvest and 3 months profit after feed expenses would be Rp1,600,000 (about $176) used to support her tenant farmer husband, and 2 children, who dropped out school after 1st year college.  Ketut Karsi hope the capital to be obtained from Dinari could add the mother pigs to be raised, so that her income would increase, given living expenses has increased too.\r\n<p><b>Translated from Bahasa Indonesia by Gwan Liong Ang, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\nWalaupun keadaan rumah yang masih sangat sederhana yaitu  terbuat dari gedek dan kayu namun usaha yang ditekuni sebagai peternak babi tetap berjalan. Saat ini ini Ketut Karsi hanya memelihara 1 ekor induk. Pemberian pakan yang dilakukan masih sangat sederhana yaitu, pakan yang terbuat dari batang pohan pisang yang direbus kemudian dicampur dengan dedak padi, pemberian ini dilakukan 2 kali yaitu pagi dan sore hari, biasanya masa hamil babi hanya 3 bulan  dan dapat melahirkan bibit 6 sampai 8 ekor anak babi. Pemeliharaan selama 6 bulan menghabiskan biaya sampai Rp. 400.000,- . Setelah dirasa cukup besar yaitu 3 bulan pemeliharaan anak babi siap dijual. Hasil penjualan bisa  mencapai Rp.2.000.000,- sekali panen dan keuntungan selama 3 bulan setelah dikurangi biaya pakan yaitu Rp.1.600.000,- dipakai untuk membantu pendapatan suaminya yang hanya seorang petani dan memenuhi kebutuhan 2 orang anaknya yang sudah putus sekolah pada tingkat pertama, Ketut Karsi berharap dengan modal yang diberikan oleh Dinari bisa menambah jumlah induk yang dipelihara agar pendapatannya semakin banyak mengingat kebutuhan hidup yang semakin banyak

Muminiso is a 38-year-old woman. She is married and is the loving mother of five children.\r\n\r\nMuminiso is a market vendor. For the last thirteen years she has been selling cottonseed oil at the local market. In the traditional Tajik cuisine the majority of the meals are fried or cooked using cottonseed oil, especially our national dish, \u201cPilau\u201d, which needs a lot of cottonseed oil in order to make it delicious.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

En la actualidad Luz Helena est\u00e1 solicitando su primer financiamiento a la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo para comprar insumos de peluquer\u00eda, como tinturas, shampoo, enjuagues, crema de masajes capilar,  todo esto en mayor volumen con relaci\u00f3n a como actualmente lo hace, lo cual es de mucha utilidad porque con el cr\u00e8dito estar\u00eda disminuyendo los costos de consumo diario, haciendo este negocio m\u00e1s atractivo y con mayor capacidad de reinvertirle.\nSu m\u00e1ximo sue\u00f1o es crecer con su familia y tener 2 peluquer\u00edas, que generen m\u00e1s empleos, y su mayor desafi\u00f3 est\u00e1 ligado justamente al cumplimiento de esa meta,  porque dispone de muy poco tiempo especialmente para la fase inicial de su nuevo plan de negocios, ya que esta actividad le absorbe mucho tiempo, teniendo en cuenta que el barrio donde se desempe\u00f1an  es muy comercial y esto hace que el trabajo siempre sea permanente y adem\u00e0s porque la atenci\u00f3n de sus dos hijos, en las edades de 5 y 10 a\u00f1os  requiere de ella una gran dedidaci\u00f2n y un mayor esfuerzo.\n","en":"Luz Helena lives in Bogot\u00e1, she owns a hairdresser\u2019s she opened more than 3 years ago, also considering her husband is a stylist. A relative provided them with enough money to start the business and to set off their dream and their project for their family life. Since then, Luz Helena and her husband have been working in the hairdressing business: they offer beauty treatments such as drying, massaging, hairdos, dyeing, perms, haircuts and hair straightening: they highlight male and female beauty and create new images that, according to the expectations of their customers, can be elegant, formal or informal. Luz Helena is now requesting her first loan to the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo (Mario Santo Domingo Foundation) to buy a wider quantity of hairdresser\u2019s products (dyes, shampoos, hair rinses, conditioners) than the amount she now has, something that would be very useful because with the loan she would reduce the expenses of the daily consumption, thus making this business more appealing and easier to reinvest.\nHer biggest dream is to grow in this business with her family, and to open 2 hairdresser\u2019s thus generating more work; her biggest challenge is exactly to achieve this goal, as she doesn\u2019t have much time to dedicate to the initial phase of her new business plan. In fact, her present activity takes too much time, since the neighborhood where they work is a busy commercial area, and this means there is always a lot of work for them; moreover, she needs to dedicate a great attention to and a put greater effort in the caring of her two children, aged 5 and 10.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Emanuela Villa, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":547771,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty Salon","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"To buy hairdresser's products.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Bogot\u00e0","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2010-05-31T15:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":525,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Luz Helena ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-05-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":86118},{"due_date":"2010-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":92773},{"due_date":"2010-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":94706},{"due_date":"2010-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":96679},{"due_date":"2010-11-05T07:00:00Z","amount":98693},{"due_date":"2010-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":100749},{"due_date":"2011-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":102848},{"due_date":"2011-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":104990},{"due_date":"2011-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":107178},{"due_date":"2011-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":115266}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.21},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.71},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.72},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.75},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.82},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.89},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.12},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.27},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.51}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":45.21,"local_amount":86118,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:11:56Z","rounded_local_amount":89067.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159636214},{"amount":48.71,"local_amount":92773,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:17:18Z","rounded_local_amount":95950.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166850311},{"amount":49.72,"local_amount":94706,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:08:08Z","rounded_local_amount":97949.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172117068},{"amount":50.75,"local_amount":96679,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T14:01:01Z","rounded_local_amount":99990.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177410937},{"amount":51.82,"local_amount":98693,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T14:08:57Z","rounded_local_amount":102073.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182550594},{"amount":52.89,"local_amount":100749,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T13:14:10Z","rounded_local_amount":104199.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188688196},{"amount":54,"local_amount":102848,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T03:39:00Z","rounded_local_amount":106370.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191427431},{"amount":55.12,"local_amount":104990,"processed_date":"2011-02-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-16T08:39:47Z","rounded_local_amount":108585.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":196000847},{"amount":56.27,"local_amount":107178,"processed_date":"2011-03-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:08:02Z","rounded_local_amount":110848.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201288856},{"amount":60.51,"local_amount":115266,"processed_date":"2011-04-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:03:59Z","rounded_local_amount":119213.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206157015}],"funded_date":"2010-06-01T03:46:15Z","paid_date":"2011-05-15T11:03:59Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Emanuela Villa","image":625792}},{"id":208983,"name":"Yisel Mar\u00eda","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Yesel Mar\u00eda P.

Her business is buying and  \r\nselling small farm animals. \r\n\r\nShe requests a new loan in the amount of 500 neuvos soles, funds that will be invested in the  purchase of more livestock to raise and resell later in fairs. She also has a plantation. \r\n\r\nHer dreams for the future are to increase her working capital and improve her earnings. What she most enjoys about the community bank are the meetings and the talks given. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Erika Lindig, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":596702,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To purchase livestock.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Mrs. Seum S. is 56 years old and the mother of a 16 year old child who is still attending school. \r\n\r\nThis is a village bank loan consisting mainly of end-of-term loans. Ten members have end-of-term loans and the rest have monthly payment loans. They are not required to pay any principal on the loan until the very end of the loan term. End-of-term (EoT) loans are AMK's main product because it is the most beneficial to Cambodia's poor. It allows them to repay portions of the principal whenever they are financially able. Most clients start to make payments many months before the end of the loan term. Almost all of AMK's clients make their payments on time. AMK has a delinquency rate of only 0.09% and AMK has a default rate of 0% on

Both of her children are currently attending elementary school in Atebubu, where she resides with her immediate family. <p>\r\n\r\nTo support her family, she sells food items such as beans, maize, rice, and groundnuts at the market square. In fact, she notes that she has been in this business for over three years now. Janet explains that she buys her food items from the wholesalers in her community and sells them to food vendors for a profit. <p>\r\n\r\nJanet is now seeking a loan in order to increase her working capital so that her dream of buying goods in bulk can be achieved. By doing so, she will be able to sell her goods to a large number of customers (i.e., she will increase her market share) and will thereby increase her profit margin. Notably, Janet belongs to a group in her community known as \"Assurance\". In this group, members guarantee each others' loans as social collateral (i.e., if one member does not promptly repay her portion of the loan, then the other members are responsible for curing the arrears), and they provide support for one another to repay their respective loans.

It has gone very well since then and she has been able to grow the business, making her famous in her community and increasing customer demand.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Her husband passed away two months ago and she currently lives with one of her daughters in the district of Cayalti, located an hour from the city of Chiclayo.\r\n\r\nFor the past three years she has run a small fruit-selling business at the entrance of her home. She sells seasonal fruits to her usual customers.  This business has helped her to cover household expenses and she currently relies on it to support herself.\r\n\r\nOlinda hopes to expand her business during this time of year because fruits such as mango, plum, pacay fruit and tamarind are in great supply in the summer. These fruits are very sought after in this season to prepare drinks, because of the stifling heat. Olinda does not have enough funds to do this herself, and for this reason she is for the first time asking for a loan of 700 Peruvian soles from Edpyme Alternativa.\r\n\r\nOlinda has not let her husband\u2019s absence get her down, and she wants to keep working. Her greatest hope is to set up a small grocery store with which she can keep moving ahead in the coming years.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Catherine Fountain, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":451545,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Purchase of fruit to expand business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Cayalt\u00ed - Chiclayo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":143,"posted_date":"2009-12-19T01:50:13Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":250,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Olinda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-12-15T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":700,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":48.17},{"due_date":"2010-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":49.77},{"due_date":"2010-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":53.4},{"due_date":"2010-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":53.22},{"due_date":"2010-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":54.46},{"due_date":"2010-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":57.77},{"due_date":"2010-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":59.16},{"due_date":"2010-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":60.36},{"due_date":"2010-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":63.01},{"due_date":"2010-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":65.05},{"due_date":"2010-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":66.99},{"due_date":"2010-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":68.64}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17.2},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.78},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.07},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.01},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.45},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.63},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.13},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.56},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.5},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.23},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.93},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":24.51}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":17.2,"local_amount":48.17,"processed_date":"2010-01-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:16:05Z","rounded_local_amount":49.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118065214},{"amount":17.78,"local_amount":49.77,"processed_date":"2010-02-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T09:47:13Z","rounded_local_amount":51.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123900312},{"amount":19.07,"local_amount":53.4,"processed_date":"2010-03-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T08:45:30Z","rounded_local_amount":54.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128934468},{"amount":19.01,"local_amount":53.22,"processed_date":"2010-04-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:08:52Z","rounded_local_amount":54.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136662083},{"amount":19.45,"local_amount":54.46,"processed_date":"2010-05-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:07:00Z","rounded_local_amount":55.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144694789},{"amount":20.63,"local_amount":57.77,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:38:29Z","rounded_local_amount":59.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151877841},{"amount":21.13,"local_amount":59.16,"processed_date":"2010-07-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T10:50:29Z","rounded_local_amount":60.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159617887},{"amount":21.56,"local_amount":60.36,"processed_date":"2010-08-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:01:34Z","rounded_local_amount":61.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166832296},{"amount":22.5,"local_amount":63.01,"processed_date":"2010-09-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T09:56:26Z","rounded_local_amount":64.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172098918},{"amount":71.67,"local_amount":200.68,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-16T10:42:02Z","rounded_local_amount":205.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177554378}],"funded_date":"2009-12-19T03:14:15Z","paid_date":"2010-11-16T10:42:02Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"C.

(0) is a 42-year-old female living in the town of Melaya, Bali. Ni Made is the group leader of a four-member group loan offered by MUK. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they all are responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is Sari Amertha 1 (MUK-0016).\r\n\r\nNi Made is married and has two school-aged children. She owns and operates a business raising pigs for sale. She has been engaged in this business for over a year and earns approximately 200,000 IDR a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Ni Made joined MUK to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. She is now requesting a loan of 2,500,000 IDR which will be used to purchase piglets to raise and sell. The loan will be her first from MUK.\r\n\r\nNi Made plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to financially support immediate members of her family.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b> About MUK:<\/b>\r\nThe mission of Koperasi Mitra Usaha Kecil (MUK) is to assist small businesses in Bali by providing training, business consultation and loans thereby helping the owners and their families improve their everyday lives.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>Note to Kiva Lenders: <\/b> \r\nThis group uses a community lending model (commonly referred to as Village Banking) that is very common throughout Asia. In this model, a select number of group representatives will take out a large loan on behalf of their entire group (often an entire village). They will then distribute and manage the loan and collect repayments for the lender.\r\n\r\nThis is a common and efficient practice in the region, but it makes reporting on Kiva somewhat unusual. Unlike most other loans, Kiva\u2019s partner, MUK, will be in contact primarily with the group leadership team who in turn will be overseeing the end borrowers. As such, journal updates likely will reflect the performance of the lending group rather than the individual end borrowers.\r\n \r\nTo learn more about Village Banking on Wikipedia, please click <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Village_Banking\" TARGET=\"_new\">here<\/a>.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>*****************************************************<\/b>\r\nNi Made Y. (0) merupakan 42 tahun wanita. Dia (perempuan) tinggal di kota Melaya - Bali. Ni Made adalah pemimpin kelompok sebuah kelompok peminjam yang terdiri atas 4 anggota. Meskipun setiap anggota kelompok menerima pinjaman perorangan, mereka semua bertanggung jawab untuk mengembalikan pinjaman rekan anggota kelompok mereka jika ada yang menunggak atau gagal membayar. Nama resmi kelompok peminjam ini adalah Sari Amertha 1 (MUK-0016).\r\n\r\nMeskipun bukan satu-satunya sarana untuk menghasilkan pendapatan, sumber utama penghasilan bisnis tersebut terutama berasal dari beternak babi untuk dijual. Ni Made sudah menjalankan bisnis ini selama lebih dari 1 tahun. Dari kegiatan-kegiatan ini, Ni Made menghasilkan sekitar 200,000 IDR. Dalam 2010, Ni Made bergabung MUK untuk mendapatkan akses ke layanan keuangan untuk membantu meningkatkan -nya kondisi kehidupan dan kemampuan untuk menjalankan kegiatan bisnis. Ni Made meminta pinjaman untuk pertama kalinya dari MUK. Dia (perempuan) sekarang meminta pinjaman baru sebesar 2,500,000 IDR.\r\n\r\nPinjaman ini akan menjadi 1st pinjaman yang diambil oleh peminjam dari MUK.\r\n\r\nTentang MUK:\r\nMisi Koperasi Mitra Usaha Kecil (MUK) adalah untuk membantu usaha kecil di Bali dengan memberikan perlatihan, konsultasi bisnis, dan pinjaman uang, dengan demikian membantu pemilik usaha dan keluarga mereka memperbaiki hidup sehari-hari.\r\n\r\nPesan untuk Peminjam Kiva: Grup ini memakai model pinjaman komunitas\/\"\"community lending\"\" (biasanya dijuluk Bank Desa\/\"\"Village Banking\"\") yang populer di Asia. Di model ini, sejumlah representatif dari grup akan meminjam uang sejumlah lebih besar untuk seluruh grup (kadang-kadang seluruh desa). Representatif ini akan distribusi dan mengendalikan pinjaman, dan mengkoleksi pembayaran untuk peminjam akhir. Ini adalah praktek umum dan efisien di daerah ini, tapi merumitkan cara lapor untuk Kiva. Tidak serupa pinjaman lain, partner Kiva, MUK, akan menjadi kontak utama dengan tim kepemimpinan grup, yang sebaliknya menjadi kontak dengan peminjam akhir. Demikian, jurnal yang ditulis akan merefleksikan hasilnya tim kepemimpinan, bukannya peminjam-peminjam akhir.\r\n\r\nUntuk belajari lebih banyak tentang Village Banking di Wikipedia, mohon kunjungi website ini: http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Village_Banking.\t\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1125,"image":{"id":523377,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To purchase piglets to raise and sell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Melaya, Bali","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":82,"posted_date":"2010-04-13T11:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1125,"lender_count":37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ni Made","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Made ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Komang","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Ketut","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-04-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"IDR","disbursal_amount":10000000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":10000000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1125}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":1125,"local_amount":10000000,"processed_date":"2011-04-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:28:26Z","rounded_local_amount":10147545,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206189218}],"funded_date":"2010-04-16T05:13:38Z","paid_date":"2011-05-15T11:28:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":5,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jeff Avery","image":233371}},{"id":196709,"name":"Ana Maria","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Ana Maria tiene la edad de 48 a\u00f1os, tiene 1 hijo a su cargo.

She makes a low income from this business, $4 each day, to cover the daily expenses of the family. Her husband also contributes to the family's income; he fishes along the Tunle Sap River. \r\n\r\nMrs. Pich usually sells fish that her husband catches, as well as those she purchases from other fishermen, for additional income.

Lucena has successfully repaid a previous loan of 20000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Lucena is requesting a new loan of 20000 PHP which will be used to purchase new items to expand product offering. This loan will be the ninth loan taken out by Lucena from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand the borrower's business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 29 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

She is 57 years old. Felisa is married and has 3 adult children. To make a living, Felisa owns and operates a specialized retail store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from buying and selling charcoal in the local community. Felisa has been engaged in her business for over 5 years and earns approximately 3,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Felisa joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Felisa has successfully repaid a previous loan of 8,000 PHP from GDMPC. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional products to sell. Felisa is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP, which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This loan will be the sixth loan taken out by Felisa from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three unit offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Paralelo a esta actividad, ella realiza jornadas de trabajo, en cultivos de sus vecinos; quienes le pagan un dinero extra por su trabajo. Ahora est\u00e1 planeando sembrar en mayores cantidades, pues requiere de mayor capital. Ella pertenece al banco comunal \u201cflor de almendra\u201d, y este es el primer cr\u00e9dito que tiene con MFP, donde est\u00e1 segura podr\u00e1 alcanzar sus objetivos. Manuela, est\u00e1 pensando utilizar el cr\u00e9dito en arreglar el auto que tiene, para incursionar en el trasporte p\u00fablico cubriendo las rutas Kivinaki-Cerro Picaflor. \n\n","en":"Manuela, age 43, is a valiant single mother who cares for her four children with much love and affection.  She lives in her own home in the native community of Kivinaki in the central Peruvian jungle.  The serious demeanor of this hardworking woman indicates the constant struggle she faces to move her children forward.  For the past ten years, Manuela has been caring for her coffee and orange crops each day beginning in the early morning hours.  These crops have resulted in good earnings as a result of her negotiations with the intermediaries who visit her three hectares of land during the harvest season.  In addition to her own farm, Manuela works as a laborer in cultivating the crops of her neighbors who pay her extra money for her work.  Now she plans to grow her crops in greater quantities, but she needs more capital.\r\n<p>\r\nManuela is a member of the Communal Bank \u201cFlor de Almendra\u201d (Almond Blossom).  This is her first loan with MFP.  She is confident that her group can accomplish its objectives.  Manuela will use her loan to repair her automobile since she plans to enter the public transportation sector by offering services along the routes betweeen Kivinaki and Cerro Picaflor.

D. lives in Abdurahmon Jomi. He is 27 years old, is married and does not have children.  Zarobuddin has a high school education and sells food.  He has a small store where he sells his products.  He brings products from Dushanbe.  Zarobuddin has been in this business for 3 years and would like to increase his inventory.  He needs a loan to do that and this is why he has turned to us.  Zarobuddin will pay back the loan over a 12 month period.  <p>\r\n\r\nBy getting new products, the client will not only increase his own income, but will also provide local residents with food products.

Yamileth's dream is to triumph in the food service industry, now that there are many restaurants in competition with her.  She wants to improve both her food service and attention for her customers because they provide the income for her business.  \r\n<p>\r\nHer profits come from selling food and renting rooms to students.  She has owned her business for 26 years.  She began   working on her own, renting rooms in her home to the students.  When the students requested that she also prepare their meals, she started a formal business.  This endeavor has turned out to be one of her most enjoyable experiences.\r\n<p>\r\nShe will use the money from the loan to buy products that she uses to prepare meals.

Yolanda C., 30 years of age, is the wife of Rolando C., an electrician. Her husband is the one who assembles the video game machines and videoke (amateur singing to a recorded music video background) machines and sells them to their customers.\r\n\r\nYolanda and Rolando are now living happily in Barangay III, Tangub City and are blessed with three children all of whom are now of school age.\r\n\r\nThe couple has run this video game and videoke machine-assembly business for already ten years. From the average of two units being assembled and sold, they are earning an average net income of P6,000 a month. With eight units of videoke machine and several video game machines operating in the city, they are also receiving an average share from all these units of not less than P5,000 every 15th and 30th day of the month.\r\n\r\nJust this year, Yolanda joined Paglaum MPC because she is interested in our programs and services. With a good character and with capacity, she was given the privilege of obtaining a loan of P50,000 with the purpose of purchasing additional parts and accessories to assemble new video game units and to recondition all other old units for sale.\r\n\r\nThe future profits from this loan will be used to save for their children\u2019s future and for their daily needs. The couple plans to expand their business to other cities and nearby municipalities.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":431943,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Games","sector":"Entertainment","themes":null,"use":"To

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

She lives in her own house, together with her husband Marcos, 36, and their only daugther Yelisa, 13. They are the reason for her hard work. With a great deal of effort Carmen has worked the fields and made them fertile. She sows potatoes and peas and she sells the harvest on a wholesale basis in the city of Tarma. The income from the sales has granted them the necessary finances to support the family which is why she puts all she's got into  her business. She has been harvesting for 4 years and she very much enjoys the work. The hardest part is distributing the product to the markets. The sacks are very heavy and make her very tired. In the future she would like to improve production to see better revenues. This is the eighth loan cycle with MFP (Kiva Field Partner). She has always been on time in the past and she is committed to being on time again. In her community group she is a very involved member, always on top of the group's business dealings.

He is married and has two children.\r\n\r\nSantos learned to farm when he was 10 years old.  It was his dad who taught him because they didn't have a regular job and he has several siblings.  In farming, they found a way of making a living and a way of life.  Santos currently sows corn with a gravity irrigation system as it is the dry season (a system through which water for irrigating the crops doesn't need any mechanisms, just gravity.  A slope is found for the water to run down and find its level, watering all the crops). However, when it rains, Santos says that they lose crops through flooding as the water is not very deep.\r\n\r\nSantos walks for fifteen minutes from his house to the main road where he boards a bus which takes thirty minutes to get to the city where he buys his farming supplies.\r\n\r\nSantos is requesting a loan from Fundaci\u00f3n Campo so that he can buy 12 sacks of fertilizer, 80 pounds of corn seed, and other supplies that he needs to sow 14,000 square meters of corn which he waters with a gravity irrigation system and sells on the cob.\r\n\r\nBy purchasing his supplies all in one go, Santos obtains lower prices and avoids having to travel to buy in small amounts.  In addition, he will be certain that he can give his crops the care they need, when they need it.  This will allow his production to increase and also his income.\r\n\r\nSantos will work hard to build a house from brick as he currently lives in a house made from adobe which doesn't have internal room divisions."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":914698,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy 12 sacks of fertilizer, 80 pounds of corn seed and other supplies he needs to sow 14,000 square meters of corn","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Usulut\u00e1n","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:16Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":30,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Santos Cesar","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-11-09T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":1000,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-16T08:21:42Z","rounded_local_amount":1000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283491896}],"funded_date":"2011-12-17T20:28:45Z","paid_date":"2012-06-16T08:21:42Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Oxnard","image":null}},{"id":360686,"name":"Srauy","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Srauy (in the photo) and her husband, Po are farmers.

name is Catarina C., and I am a 39-year-old native of Salamanga, Matutuine district, Maputo province. I am a married mother of 4 children, and I attended school up until the 6th grade. I could not continue my studies due to the 16-year civil war that severely affected the Matutuine district. During the civil war my parents took refuge in neighboring South Africa. For two years I worked as a cabinet-maker in a carpenter\u2019s shop and after that I worked as a housemaid for two residences. In 1989 I married a young Mozambique man who at the time also worked in South Africa. With the end of the civil war in 1992 my husband and I decided to return to Mozambique. In 1994, after settling the family in the city of Maputo, I dedicated myself to the sale of diverse products from my residence. My family found it difficult adapting to urban life and in 1995 we decided to move back to my native home of Salamanga, Matutuine district. That same year I began to work on a project of reintegration for those returning from neighboring countries; I worked as a sewing instructor. At project\u2019s end in 1996 I returned to the sale of everyday goods at the local market. In 1998 I rented a small commercial establishment belonging to my brother, and to this day I continue to work there. At this time my husband and I and 4 other employees depend on this business. With the loan I intend to acquire a vehicle to transport diverse cargo to my commercial establishment. This would facilitate our contribution to the increased rent and to the availability of diverse products at accessible prices to more than 100 families residing in the town of Salamanga. <p> <b>Translated from Portuguese by Marco Alves, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>Catarina C. de 39 anos de idade, Natural de Salamanga, distrito de Matutu\u00edne Prov\u00edncia de Maputo, Casada Maritalmente, M\u00e3e de 4 filhos, tendo sido escolarizada at\u00e9 6\u00aa classe, N\u00e3o conseguiu continuar mais com os estudos devido a  guerra  civil dos 16 que afectou severamente o distrito de Matutu\u00edne.\r\n\r\nDurante a guerra os pais refugiaram-se na vizinha \u00c1frica do Sul em  1985, Por l\u00e1 come\u00e7ou a trabalhar numa Carpintaria com a Fun\u00e7\u00e3o de marceneira,  por um per\u00edodo de Dois Anos e mais tarde veio a trabalhar como empregada Domestica em duas residenciais.  \r\n\r\nEm 1989 Casou-se Maritalmente na Africa do sul com um jovem mo\u00e7ambicano, que na altura se encontrava a trabalhar naquele pais vizinho. \r\n\r\nCom o fim da Guerra em 1992 decidem com o marido voltar a Mo\u00e7ambique em 1994,  Tendo  fixado a fam\u00edlia na cidade do Maputo e l\u00e1 dedicava-se a venda de produtos diversos na sua resid\u00eancia, segundo ela, n\u00e3o foram felizes com a realidade urbana assim viram-se obrigados em 1995 a voltar para Salamanga no distrito de Matutu\u00edne, zona de origem. \r\n\r\nAinda no mesmo ano come\u00e7ou a trabalhar num projecto de reasentamento dos regressados dos pa\u00edses vizinhos como facilitadora dos cursos de corte e costura.

san is a charming 31 year old lady, has two children and is separated from her husband. She lives in the town of Ruai in the outskirts of Nairobi. By natural instinct Susan started braiding her sister\u2019s hair when they were growing up. As time went by she became an expert in plaiting and braiding hair. A close friend of hers who was operating a salon suggested she learn how to apply chemical to clients\u2019 hair and also how to style hair. Her friend taught her the skills free of charge over a period of two years. Susan saved Ksh 5,000 (USD 76) while she was a member of a merry-go-round group in her village. From this money, she rented a stall for Ksh 2,000 (USD 30) in the year 2005. With the balance she bought a mirror for the stall and then started plaiting clients\u2019 hair since she did not have enough money to purchase salon equipment. Her friend Catherine Wambura then gave her a blow-dryer free of charge in order to support herself. Clients flocked her stall and by the end of the year 2005, from her small savings and proceedings from her business, Susan managed to buy a dryer. Today her salon is one of the most frequently visited salons in Ruai. Due to the growing number of customers and the desire to give them first class service, Susan is requesting for a loan of USD 475 in kind, which will enable her to purchase a blow-dryer, hair dryer, steamer, and various chemicals. This will greatly help to support her business since she could not steam clients\u2019 hair before due to lack of a steaming machine. This equipment will greatly boost her business. She intends to pay her loan within a period of 8-12 months."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":41066,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty Salon","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"To purchase  a blow drier, Hair drier, Steamer ane Hair relaxing chemicals","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Ruai, Nairobi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":36,"posted_date":"2007-06-08T04:13:59Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":475,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Susan","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-06-22T10:17:32Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":475,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":59.38},{"due_date":"2007-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":59.38},{"due_date":"2007-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":59.38},{"due_date":"2007-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":59.38},{"due_date":"2007-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":59.38},{"due_date":"2007-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":59.38},{"due_date":"2008-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":59.38},{"due_date":"2008-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":59.34}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":59.38},{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":59.38},{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":59.38},{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":59.38},{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":59.38},{"due_date":"2008-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":59.38},{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":59.38},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":59.34}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":60,"local_amount":60,"processed_date":"2007-08-10T09:17:08Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-10T10:29:15Z","rounded_local_amount":60,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":41038},{"amount":60,"local_amount":60,"processed_date":"2007-09-10T09:17:23Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-10T10:29:15Z","rounded_local_amount":60,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52814},{"amount":60,"local_amount":60,"processed_date":"2007-10-10T09:17:50Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-10T10:29:15Z","rounded_local_amount":60,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":65539},{"amount":60,"local_amount":60,"processed_date":"2007-11-10T10:18:31Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-10T10:29:15Z","rounded_local_amount":60,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":79402},{"amount":60,"local_amount":60,"processed_date":"2007-12-10T10:19:53Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-10T10:29:15Z","rounded_local_amount":60,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":94671},{"amount":60,"local_amount":60,"processed_date":"2008-01-10T10:15:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-10T10:29:15Z","rounded_local_amount":60,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":113187},{"amount":60,"local_amount":60,"processed_date":"2008-02-10T10:15:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-10T10:29:15Z","rounded_local_amount":60,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":132590},{"amount":55,"local_amount":55,"processed_date":"2008-03-10T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-10T10:29:15Z","rounded_local_amount":55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":154527}],"funded_date":"2007-06-08T10:17:32Z","paid_date":"2008-03-10T10:04:54Z","journal_totals":{"entries":5,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":15633,"name":"Liana","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Liana is a widow with a grown son named Arthur.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets; therefore, they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions.

Some raise cuy (guinea pigs) and will use the loan for food and medicines for their animals.\n\nAll of the members appreciate and thank you for the loan and promise to pay the monthly payments on time.\n\n(EDY MARLENY is not pictured in the photo)"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4725,"image":{"id":423209,"template_id":1},"video":{"id":1281,"youtubeId":"fPi6ZMrPhXM","title":"Kiva Entrepreneur EDY MARLENY from  Peru","thumbnailImageId":423209},"activity":"Bakery","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Breadmaking supplies","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Oropesa - Quispicanchi - Cusco","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":119,"posted_date":"2009-11-16T18:30:18Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":4725,"lender_count":152,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Edy Marleny","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Tania Gladys","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alicia Fortunata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jose Braulio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Olinda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Segura Nelly","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ana Cecilia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Medi Flavia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Felicitas\n","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Carlota Irma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yanez","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Vda De Astete Guillermina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Mercerdes","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Victoria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-10-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":13800,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":4725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":2080.5},{"due_date":"2009-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":2163.73},{"due_date":"2010-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":2250.28},{"due_date":"2010-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":2340.3},{"due_date":"2010-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":2433.92},{"due_date":"2010-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":2531.27}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":712.35},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":740.84},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":770.47},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":801.3},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":833.36},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":866.68}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":712.43,"local_amount":2080.74,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T11:36:00Z","rounded_local_amount":2083.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103750224},{"amount":740.95,"local_amount":2164.05,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T12:01:37Z","rounded_local_amount":2167.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110637652},{"amount":770.58,"local_amount":2250.58,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T10:43:00Z","rounded_local_amount":2253.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118034149},{"amount":801.39,"local_amount":2340.56,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T09:05:14Z","rounded_local_amount":2344.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123872246},{"amount":833.44,"local_amount":2434.16,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T08:19:21Z","rounded_local_amount":2437.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128905513},{"amount":866.21,"local_amount":2529.91,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T09:48:46Z","rounded_local_amount":2533.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136633168}],"funded_date":"2009-11-18T16:31:20Z","paid_date":"2010-05-15T09:48:46Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Liz Nagle","image":784126}},{"id":155108,"name":"Nary's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Nary H. is a group leader of four members who all live in the Kshach village in Kandal province.

She has a perfect repayment record on past loans, and her story is typical of other Dominican and Haitian borrowers at Esperanza International.\r\n\r\nSory lives with her husband and four children in El Seybo, a small rural town in the heart of the agricultural east of the Dominican Republic. Life in rural areas of the Dominican Republic can be tough, with no potable running water, frequent power outages (if one has power to begin with), and inadequate access to healthcare among other issues. Despite these difficulties, Sory has a successful small business selling clothing to people in her community. With this loan, she will buy underwear, women\u2019s pants, and bedsheets to sell at a small markup.\r\n\r\nThis is Sory\u2019s eighth loan with Esperanza International. In less than three years, she has been able to increase her loan size by nearly ten times, a true testament to her hard work. With continued profits, Sory hopes to keep the growth of her business going and finish the construction of her home in order to give her family a more comfortable place to live (a common construction technique in the Dominican Republic is to build in stages as one acquires the money to do so). In addition, her profits have given Sory confidence that her children will grow up with a good education and have the opportunity to pursue any profession they desire, a luxury Sory did not have while growing up.\r\n\r\nEsperanza International seeks to free children and their families through initiatives that generate income, education and health, and that restore self-worth and dignity to those who have lost hope.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.
