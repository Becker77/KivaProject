Thi Nguyen, 32 years old, has been participating in the Fund since 2006. The family\u2019s finances are encountering many difficulties; her husband works as labor for hire and she stays home to take care of their young children and work the fields.  The farming work does not take up all her time, so she planned with her husband to join the Fund to start a home business and supplement the family\u2019s income.  The project she decided to invest in was making statues from plaster.  The work is not too arduous, but the profit is still relatively high.  In subsequent rounds of funding she always invested in buying more plaster.  Since she has been in the Fund and doing this trade, the family\u2019s finances have improved greatly, and she still has time to do farm work and take care of her children.  In this round of funding she is requesting 9,000,000 VND to buy more plaster.

The 4 younger ones are attending school.\r\n\r\nAfter getting married, Helena left Manica with her husband who resided in the capital city of Maputo at the time. At the beginning of her life there, she used to spend a long time on her own because her husband was a truck driver. She then started a business selling Pastel ( a typical deep fried treat), a trade she learned from her mother during her childhood. Years later, her husband bought a plot of land in the city of Namaacha in the Swaziland boarder and built the house where they now live. \r\n\r\nNowadays, she is the owner of a snack bar located inside the Namaacha secondary school. She works from 4 am to 10 pm, time when the night classes end. She is helped by two employees who earn 1.500,00 MT each. Her best selling items are pastel, chamussas and cakes. She makes them to order, for baptisms, weddings and birthday parties. Helena travels once a week to buy wheat flour, vegetable oil cans and two bags of sugar for 1.200,00MT each, spending at least 15.000,00 MT and getting a profit in the amount of 10.000,00 MT monthly. \r\nBesides being responsible for her children, she also has her mother under her care.\r\n\r\nThis is her third loan with Hluvuku and her first with Kiva.

Paralelo a ello, tambi\u00e9n se dedica a cultivar papa, olluco y avena. Es as\u00ed que ha transcurrido 12 a\u00f1os realizando estas actividades agrarias, ya que le permiten cubrir las necesidades de su hogar. Con el tiempo espera comprar reses, en especial vacas, para que pueda extraer la leche y elaborar quesos de diferentes tama\u00f1os para llevarlos a comercializar en las tiendas de su localidad o a las ferias semanales de la ciudad de Tarma.

She raises animals such as guinea pigs, chickens, pigs, sheep, and donkeys, work that she really enjoys. She is very careful and gives them the necessary food so they grow up fat and healthy and she can sell them for a good price. \r\n\r\nAs well as raising livestock, Adela grows potatoes, olluca (a root vegetable), and oats. She has spent twelve years working in agriculture which has allowed her to pay for household expenses. In the future she hopes to buy more animals, especially cows, so she can use the milk to make cheese of different sizes to sell in local shops or weekly markets in Tarma. Adela\u2019s husband has a carpentry business where he makes very good furniture. In his spare time he helps Adela on the farm. \r\n\r\nThis is her sixth loan with Kiva partner MFP and she is happy to continue working with the members of her community group whom she respects greatly for their hard work. With the loan she will buy 10-15 cattle which she will fatten for several months and then sell them for a good price.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jane Agg, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":566069,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy animals","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-07-11T23:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":725,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Adela ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-06-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":725}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":725,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T15:14:09Z","rounded_local_amount":2047.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177449686}],"funded_date":"2010-07-12T04:33:24Z","paid_date":"2010-11-15T15:14:09Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jane A"}},{"id":217645,"name":"Jalia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jalia is married with four children.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from raising pigs for fattening and sale. Yolanda has been engaged in her business for over 6 years and earns approximately 4,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Yolanda joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Yolanda has successfully repaid a previous loan of 4,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to to purchase baby livestock to raise and sell in the future. Yolanda is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase livestock feed & other supplies. This loan will be the second loan taken out by Yolanda from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to financially support immediate members of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 29 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She earns her living by operating 2 business ventures: a sari-sari (general) store and a vegetable vending businesses. Her husband, Sergio O., is 56 years old and helps his wife with the businesses. They have 6 children who arebetween the ages of 23 to 32 years. \r\n\r\nMerlinda joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2004 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 14 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Merlinda has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 18,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 500\/day, thus uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her 15th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 19,000 which she intends to use as additional capital for the business. She hopes to continue to save up for the future and to provide for the needs of her family. Merlinda O. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

(PK-10331) is a 46-year-old man living in the town of Melaya - Bali.  He is married and has two school-aged children.  To make a living, Slamet owns & operates a business venture in the food sector making & selling food.  While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from selling snacks & other delicacies in the local community.  \r\n\r\nSlamet has been engaged in this business for over 10 years and earns approximately 600,000 IDR a month from these activities. Slamet really enjoys this business, especially when seeing the buyers are satisfied with the service.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Slamet joined MUK to gain access to financial services to help improve  his living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Slamet is requesting a new loan of 4,500,000 IDR from MUK which will be used to purchase additional inventory and as working capital.  This will be the 1st loan taken out by the borrower from MUK.  Slamet plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business  to pay the tuition fees of his children.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout MUK:\r\n\r\nThe mission of Koperasi Mitra Usaha Kecil (MUK) is to assist small businesses in Bali by providing training, business consultation, and loans thereby helping the owners and their families improve their everyday lives.\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nSlamet H. (PK-10331) merupakan 46 tahun pria.  Dia (laki-laki) tinggal di kota Melaya - Bali.  Dia (laki-laki) menikah dan memiliki 2 anak usia sekolah.  Untuk membiayai hidup, Slamet memiliki & menjalankan usaha.  Bisnis beroperasi di sektor pangan.  Tujuan utama bisnis tersebut adalah membuat & menjual makanan.  Meskipun bukan satu-satunya sarana untuk menghasilkan pendapatan, sumber utama penghasilan bisnis tersebut terutama berasal dari menjual makanan ringan & makanan kecil lainnya di tengah masyarakat setempat.  Slamet sudah menjalankan bisnis ini selama lebih dari 10 tahun.  Dari kegiatan-kegiatan ini, Slamet menghasilkan sekitar 600.000 IDR sebulan.\r\n\r\n\r\nDalam 2010, Slamet bergabung MUK untuk mendapatkan akses ke layanan keuangan untuk membantu meningkatkan  -nya kondisi kehidupan dan kemampuan untuk menjalankan kegiatan bisnis.  Slamet telah berhasil melunasi pinjaman sebelumnya dari MUK.    Dia (laki-laki) sekarang meminta pinjaman baru sebesar 4.500.000 IDR.  Pinjaman saat ini akan digunakan untuk untuk membeli inventaris & modal kerja tambahan.  Pinjaman ini akan menjadi 1st pinjaman yang diambil oleh peminjam dari MUK.  Slamet berencana untuk menggunakan pendapatan tambahan yang dihasilkan dari bisnis  untuk membayar biaya sekolah anak-anak peminjam.\r\n\r\n\r\nTentang MUK:\r\n\r\nMisi Koperasi Mitra Usaha Kecil (MUK) adalah untuk membantu usaha kecil di Bali dengan memberikan perlatihan, konsultasi bisnis, dan pinjaman uang, dengan demikian membantu pemilik usaha dan keluarga mereka memperbaiki hidup sehari-hari.\r\n\r\nPesan untuk Peminjam Kiva: Grup ini memakai model pinjaman komunitas\/\"\"community lending\"\" (biasanya dijuluk Bank Desa\/\"\"Village Banking\"\") yang populer di Asia. Di model ini, sejumlah representatif dari grup akan meminjam uang sejumlah lebih besar untuk seluruh grup (kadang-kadang seluruh desa). Representatif ini akan distribusi dan mengendalikan pinjaman, dan mengkoleksi pembayaran untuk peminjam akhir.

She is the group leader of a 7-member group loan offered by SEDA.  While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they all are responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is N. X\u00e1 1 - Nh\u00f3m 18 (18).\n\nThoi  is married and has 4 school-aged children. She owns and operates a business raising livestock, primarily chickens, for sale. Thoi has been engaged in this business for over 7 years and earns approximately 3,200,000 VND a month from it.\n\nIn 2007, Thoi joined SEDA to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Thoi has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,152,000 VND from SEDA, which was used to purchase baby livestock to raise and sell in the future. She is now requesting a new loan of 7.392.000 VND which will be used to purchase livestock feed and other supplies. This will be Thoi's 4th loan from SEDA.

This is a rural zone, with humble conditions, that does not count on all the basic services.\r\n\r\nRosa is a hard-working woman that has a great desire to help her family get ahead.  She dedicates herself to selling groceries (flour, rice, noodles, condiments, sugar, etc.) and beverages from a small general store located in her home.  Luckily, Rosa counts on established customers from her area.

They also have a stand in the Nery Garc\u00eda market selling meat.\r\n\r\nAparicio is very grateful for the loans he gets because they contributed to his being able to realize his dreams.  Now his wish is to send his children abroad to study.  The loan he\u2019s asking for will be used to buy beef at wholesale to sell.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":851680,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Butcher

It is also known for its famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi, and many others. The country, filled with epic mountain passes, is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, and boasts a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture, and Central Asian traditions. \r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 percent of the country is mountainous and only 7 percent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n<p>\r\nMore about IMON International\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition.

She is married to Fernando F., a factory worker, and they are blessed with two children. She makes sure that she helps her husband earn so that their family can have a better life.  She has been in the rug-making business for 11 years.\r\n\r\nMary Jean has been a regular member of the Kiva field partner, Center for Community Transformation* (CCT), for more than three years now. She regularly attends their weekly fellowship meetings and pays her weekly dues consistently. Because of her good repayment performance with her previous loans, she was able to borrow seven times through CCT\u2019s Cooperative. She is consistent in paying her dues because she used the money she borrowed to buy raw materials for her rug-making business.  She is able to earn a profit of about $275 a month.  \r\n\r\nNow with your help, she would like to apply for a 12,000 PHP loan. This amount will be used as a source of added capital to her expanding business for buying raw materials like strips of cloth, crayons and sewing thread.\r\n\r\nShe dreams that through this added capital, her monthly profit will also increase. She prays that someday they will have their own home and that her children will graduate from college. \r\n\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay Micro Finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":467978,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"To

Bevelyn is requesting a new loan of 5000 PHP which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This loan will be the 5th loan taken out by Bevelyn from HSPFI.

P. is from the village of Cabisera 25, Ilagan. She is 50 years old. Zenaida is married and has 4 adult children. To make a living, Zenaida owns and operates a general store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling a variety of different products in the local community. Zenaida has been engaged in her business for over 3 years and earns approximately 6,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Zenaida joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Zenaida has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Zenaida is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the 4th loan taken out by Zenaida from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 29 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

For Klichboy, there is nothing better than being in touch with nature and watching the fruit of his labor grow year after year.\r\n\r\n In addition, Klichboy raises cattle and his family helps him with his business.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The loan will enable her to provide her family with better living conditions at home. Maysaa' is a conservative woman, so her husband Odai is photographed instead at the FATEN branch.<p>\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout this loan product:\r\n\r\nFATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.<p>\r\n\r\nFor more information on lending in the Muslim

With this loan of 2,000 nuevos soles, which she will repay in 6 months, she will buy a larger quantity of clothing, ten bedspreads, a dozen wallets, ten sheets, a dozen pieces of jewellery, etc.  Gloria feels at peace because her business lets her support her home.  She is attracting more clients, and her income is increasing, which benefits her family.  This is all thanks to the support of Manuela Ramos. <p><b>Translated from Spanish by Tanya Harper, Kiva volunteer<\/b><\/p>\r\nLa se\u00f1ora Gloria pertenece al Banco Comunal Atenas Portillanas, vive en el Asentamiento Humano La Lupuna del distrito Yarina Cocha, departamento de Ucayali.

is a 45 year old man who lives in Saida, southern Lebanon with his wife and their six children. \r\n<p>\r\nMahmoud has owned a grocery store since 2007, and has sold scrap metal since 1990.  He requests a loan of $1500 from Al Majmoua to purchase a pick up for his businesses.  This is the first time Mahmoud has requested a loan. \r\n<p>\r\nMahmoud is special because he has two businesses and is doing his best to improve his family's financial situation.  His clients are friends and neighbors for his store and traders of scrap metals.

Thanks to Hluvuku and Kiva now Daniel has his own house where he lives with his family, his best product are recharge cards that are sold for 15,00MT, 45.00MT, 74.00MT and 90.00MT and sell for 20.00MT, 50.00MT, 80.00MT and 100.00MT traveling 4 times a month he gets an income of 5,000.00MT and is able to profit 1,000.00MT he helps his grandmother who is still in Homoine sending her a box of soap, 50kg of rice and 25kg of sugar every 6 months, which is about 1,500.00MT.\r\nThis is the second loan Jose is requesting to Hluvuku and Kiva. The first 12,000.00MT increased the volum of the merchandise to satisfy his clients' necessities, and now he is requesting 20,000.00MT is for the same because at the frontier there is great demand for his services. He is sure he will pay the loan before the deadline and request a new loan to enlarge his house.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Nina Delgado, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":353568,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To increase the stock in his business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MZ","country":"Mozambique","town":"Namaacha","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-25.970278 32.025556","type":"point"}},"partner_id":23,"posted_date":"2009-07-20T04:10:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jos\u00e9 Daniel ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-06-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MZN","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":16,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":527.46},{"due_date":"2009-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":551.3},{"due_date":"2009-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":576.22},{"due_date":"2009-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":602.27},{"due_date":"2009-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":629.5},{"due_date":"2009-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":657.95},{"due_date":"2010-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":687.7},{"due_date":"2010-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":718.78},{"due_date":"2010-03-13T08:00:00Z","amount":751.28},{"due_date":"2010-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":785.24},{"due_date":"2010-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":820.73},{"due_date":"2010-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":857.84},{"due_date":"2010-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":896.62},{"due_date":"2010-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":937.11}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.78},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.67},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.61},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.59},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.61},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":24.67},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25.79},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.95},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.17},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.45},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.78},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.17},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.62},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.14}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":19.78,"local_amount":527.46,"processed_date":"2009-07-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T14:55:13Z","rounded_local_amount":531.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63191077},{"amount":20.67,"local_amount":551.3,"processed_date":"2009-08-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T16:49:11Z","rounded_local_amount":555.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73618944},{"amount":48.96,"local_amount":1305.59,"processed_date":"2009-09-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T19:50:27Z","rounded_local_amount":1314.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87056782},{"amount":97.22,"local_amount":2592.6,"processed_date":"2009-10-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T23:26:36Z","rounded_local_amount":2610.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96971733},{"amount":105.17,"local_amount":2804.51,"processed_date":"2009-12-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T14:24:03Z","rounded_local_amount":2823.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110708866},{"amount":54.98,"local_amount":1466.07,"processed_date":"2010-02-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:27:24Z","rounded_local_amount":1476.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123937840},{"amount":28.22,"local_amount":752.47,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-20T08:11:47Z","rounded_local_amount":757.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123937841}],"funded_date":"2009-07-20T14:03:33Z","paid_date":"2010-03-20T08:11:47Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Nina Delgado","image":347326}},{"id":126685,"name":"Eunice Anyango","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Eunice sells cereals and other basic items at her kiosk in the town of Rongo, Kenya.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

This has meant that, so far, the business has not grown. This issue motivated her to request a loan of PHP7,000 from ASKI and Kiva lenders, as additional business capital. She will utilize this amount, if it is granted, to buy a larger volume of fish to sell in her village. She would be thankful for this financial assistance because it would help her very much to improve her fish vending business.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":150,"image":{"id":383445,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish

She lives with her life partner, Roberto (39), and their 3 lively children: Frank (10), Jean Pierre (7) and Derlys (2). They have had their own house under the blue skies of the Peruvian mountains for some years now.\r\n\r\nFrom an early age, she watched her parents farming their land to put food on the table; that is how she learned the techniques and everything she needs to know in order to farm, and she has been applying that knowledge since she began working on her own farm alongside her husband.\r\nShe gets up at dawn every day to go out to the fields, where she grows potatoes and carrots; she also keeps cattle. Faustina likes farming a lot; it's what she learned when she was a little girl, and she also makes a good profit from selling her produce, particularly potatoes.\r\nFaustina proudly says that she will work unceasingly until her children have a profession, since she wants them to study and be able to fend for themselves when she is no longer with them.\r\nLooking to the future, she wants to set up a grocery store in the center of the city, since she knows that is a profitable business.\r\n\r\nThis is Faustina's seventh loan from MFP and she is certain to be responsible and punctual with the repayments since she knows that only people who fulfill their responsibilities get ahead in life. She is also happy working with the community bank as the members are hard-working women who want to succeed. Faustina plans to invest the loan in stock for the grocery store she plans to open in the near future.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by John Rynne, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":452979,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Invest in a new business ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-12-20T09:30:13Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Faustina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-11-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":350}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":350,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2010-09-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:25:06Z","rounded_local_amount":1008,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172153767}],"funded_date":"2009-12-20T12:14:44Z","paid_date":"2010-10-15T10:25:06Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"John Rynne","image":161916}},{"id":167936,"name":"Lika","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Lika L., who lives in Damnak village in Takeo province, is 43 years old.

It has produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Her previous loan of 20,000 PHP helped her earn a monthly profit of about $418, thus raising the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 23rd cycle loan, she is borrowing 22,000 PHP, which she intends to use as additional working capital so that she can continue to save up for future improvements in her businesses.  Emma D. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\n\r\n In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She receives the Yanbal products at home and the clothing and phone cards downtown from a distributor.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He is married and has a one year old baby.  Juli\u00e3o studied until the 10th grade but had to stop when he became gravely ill.  After he recovered he entered into the business world by buying window frames and doors in neighboring Swaziland and re-selling them in the capital of Maputo.  He was able to build his own home and a commercial building.  He later changed jobs when the Mozambique government implemented a law that regulated border activity\u2014in order to monitor contraband on its way to Namaacham or Maputo.  His new job was selling basic products in a small convenience store.  He has never worked with other lending companies and this is his first loan, for 10.000,00MT, which he will use to increase the volume of his products.  He will buy rice, beans, peanuts and sugar.  He makes about 3.000.00MT and is able to save 1.000.00MT, since he is only responsible for his daughter.  He pledges to repay his loan before the determined time and hopes to receive another loan in the future.  He would like to purchase irrigation equipment  and get started in the agricultural field, since there is a large water source and fertile land in his region.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from

Bacilio lives in the community of Pampa el Coscal, province of Cordillera in the Municipality of Cabezas where he works in agriculture, planting corn and watermelon. His entire crop is sold at the market \"El Torno\" and not in his municipality.

She lives with her two brothers in la Mina Guifarro neighborhood, in the city of Juticalpa in the state of Olancho. She is a young woman who has always had to work since her mother immigrated to the United States illegally and someone had to help out with family expenses. Every weekend she works as a roving saleswoman, offering merchandise such as sandles, cosmetics, women's accessories and clothing. From Monday to Friday she has another job. Ana is asking for a loan because currently she does not have much inventory and she needs to travel to the city of Tegucigalpa to buy merchandise, above all the latest fashions. With the loan she will be able to increase her income because she will obtain more earnings which will allow her to support her brothers, who are both studying. One of the problems that she has had is that her mother is not in good health and she cannot be close to her to offer support. Her hopes are that her mother's health improves, and to have her own space that is large and beautiful to display her products, and for her brothers to have good careers. This is her second loan with FAMA and she has made her payments punctually.\n\nTranslated from Spanish:\nAna Cecilia tiene 25 a\u00f1os de edad, es soltera, no tiene hijos, y junto a sus dos hermanos reside en la Colonia Mina Guifarro en la ciudad de Juticalpa, departamento de Olancho. Es una joven que desde temprana edad ha tenido que trabajar porque su madre emigr\u00f3 a Estados Unidos de forma ilegal y alguien ten\u00eda que ayudar con los gastos familiares. Los fines de semana ella se dedica a vender de forma ambulante mercader\u00eda como ser sandalias, cosm\u00e9ticos, accesorios para mujer, y tambi\u00e9n ropa mixta, etc., y de lunes a viernes tiene un empleo fijo. Ana solicita el pr\u00e9stamo porque actualmente no tiene mucho inventario y necesita viajar a la ciudad de Tegucigalpa para comprar mercader\u00eda sobre todo estilos que est\u00e1n a la moda. Con el apoyo del pr\u00e9stamo ella podr\u00e1 tener mayores ingresos porque obtendr\u00e1 ganancias y con estas apoyar\u00e1 a sus hermanos ya que ambos est\u00e1n estudiando. Una de sus dificultades es que su madre est\u00e1 mal de salud y no puede estar cerca de ella para apoyarla.

He lives in Ica, a city that has recently had a large increase in investment, not only in agricultural exports - in other words, large farms - but also in the opening of new commercial centers that bring many jobs to regular citizens of Ica. In his free time, Mario Alberto enjoys building houses. Peru is well known for having some of the most delicious foods int he world, and one of the dishes that Mario Alberto enjoys is \"carapulcra con sopa seca\" (a combination of a pasta dish and a beef or pork stew that are often served together). Mario Alberto studied until the fifth year of secondary school, and he would have liked to have studied veterinary medicine. He lives with his partner, who is the head of the household, and they have two children together. The younger child is three years old and attends an early education center; the older child is 17 years old, and he is in the fifth year of secondary school.\r\n\r\nMario Alberto is a master construction worker, always working efficiently and responsibly. He works about nine hours a day. His friends encouraged him to go into this type of work, and because of the earthquake in 2007, the need for skilled construction workers has increased.In one day, he can attend to one client, and because of the complexity of the labor involved, he is able to earn an average of 52 soles (roughly 20 USD); on a good day, he could early 100 soles (roughly 38 USD), which helps him with a few additional household expenses. His business is successful because he does his work in a responsible and honorable way, and because of this, many people comment on his good work and recommend him to others. Now, Mario Alberto hopes that Kiva lenders can help him to be able to buy more tools, and with these tools offer better service and not have to rent necessary tools. Mario Alberto will repay the loan in six months.\r\n\r\nThis improvement of having good tools will help him in his daily work, and in this way, he will be able to increase his income to improve his family's quality of life.

She also says, \u201cno work, no life\u201d as she and her husband are daily wage earners and their source of income is unreliable and irregular based, mainly on work availability and appropriate workload. She is the featured borrower for Dorcas Lom Group and she is pictured with her hand raised.  Her kids are in the capital town to study in good schools as the village does not have a good school. Her husband is a farmer and works in a paddy field. During off farming season, he usually sieves sand and digs underneath the riverbank for massive stones and sells them at a good price. It is completely manual work and takes a hard toil on the labourer. Deprived of all basic education, both Lhingkhochong and her husband work hard to manage the family expenses with all available work.\r\n\r\nLhingkhochong's main source of income is selling her own vegetable produce. She usually plants all seasonal vegetables and sell them after a period of four months, when the plants are fully grown. Her other income-generating activity is selling rice in the village and nearby villages. The rice supply is bought from the neighbouring state and sold in the town market and also in the village. The generated income is meager and can\u2019t provide enough capital to start her livestock farming business, which had been her plan for quite a long time.\r\n\r\nWith the Kiva loan Lhingkhochong  plans to purchase two does and two bucks when she accesses the loan. Her plan is to rear the young goats while she is working in the fields and sell them when they mature. With the income she also aspires to start a charcoal business which is one of the highest demands in the area. It is non-seasonal and has no threat of expiration which is a very good option for generating income for them.\r\n\r\nShe thanked Kiva and WSDS for the wonderful support, enabling the group members to fulfill their desires and plans. She says she will always remain obliged and will also repay the loan on time. She also made a request that Kiva will continue helping them and hopes the co-operation will be a grand success. She says, \"thank you so much, Kiva!\u201d\r\n\r\nThe rest of the group members are also engaged in weaving, farming, selling vegetables, piggery etc.\r\n"}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1424381,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To purchase two does and two bucks, raise them, and sell them for a profit when fully grown.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"New Keithelmanbi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":238,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1750,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lhingkhochong","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nemvah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tingjakhol","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tingneilam","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kimneilam","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kholhing","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Phaljakhol","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nemngah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Themneng","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lhingjaneng","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lhingneilam","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-09-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":110000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":1750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":110000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1750}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":992974,"name":"Mt Udzungwa Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"KAIM, who is in his early 40's is married with three schooling children.

Her husband had passed away and Juana was left with the responsibility for her children. She looked for various alternatives to earn money and this was the best way to accommodate her needs, because she can also care for her children while she works. This is a better life, and Juana enjoys sales. First Juana began washing and ironing clothing and cleaning the houses of her neighbors, plus a couple of other activities that combined, earned enough income to support her children. In April 2002 Juana began to sell used clothing when her son, who lives in the U.S., sent her boxes of used clothing. She sold them, and was able to support her other children and help her grandchildren. Thanks to a previous loan with Kiva, Juana could buy more boxes of clothing. Now she'd like to buy used clothing for autumn and winter. \r\n\r\nJuana needs a loan of US $400, which she'll repay in 5 months. She'll use the money to buy more boxes of clothing so as to offer better supplies to her clients and increase her sales and income. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Sarah Bishop, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":213229,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Used Clothing","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"Buy merchandise","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Tampico, Tamaulipas","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"22.216667 -97.85","type":"point"}},"partner_id":16,"posted_date":"2008-10-17T11:50:12Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-10-31T14:44:58Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":5000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2008-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2009-01-31T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2009-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2009-03-31T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":80}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":80,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2008-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-17T09:07:17Z","rounded_local_amount":1046.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5279983},{"amount":80,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2008-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-21T08:55:54Z","rounded_local_amount":1046.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9891772},{"amount":80,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2009-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-24T08:50:50Z","rounded_local_amount":1046.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14815002},{"amount":80,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2009-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T07:54:07Z","rounded_local_amount":1046.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20349807},{"amount":80,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2009-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T09:02:02Z","rounded_local_amount":1046.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27037093}],"funded_date":"2008-10-17T14:44:58Z","paid_date":"2009-04-15T09:02:02Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sarah Bishop","image":107465}},{"id":73469,"name":"Patience","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Patience O. sells yams at Use market in Benin City, Edo State, Nigeria.

She married, and the fruit of this union is the four children she had. Confident that the sale of beers and sodas would generate a good income, she began a business two years ago. Her good relations, courtesy and the joy that she transmits brought in customers, and demand grew, exceeding her goals and increasing her workload. Trinidad has new goals, including the installation of a bar in the center of her district. She is looking for a location in an attractive neighborhood with a lot of recreation and shopping centers so that she will benefit from the numbers of people.

He started his career by making tailor-made shirts and pants; over the years his business has expanded.\r\n<p> \r\nMr. R. is requesting a loan to buy zippers (in every color), cloth and shoe soles, which would supply him with the materials necessary to take care of customer demands at a moment's notice. \r\n<p>\r\nWith this loan he will be able to buy a larger quantity of materials from Santa Elena (a local wholesale vendor) at a discounted rate.\r\n<p>\r\nIn the future, he would like to buy sheet metal to secure the roof of his shop. He dreams of one day being a material's distributor to other tailors in the city. \r\n<p>\r\nHe is grateful for any support we can provide his business so that his family may prosper!\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":424104,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Tailoring","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"To buy cloth, zippers and shoe soles.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Guayaquil (Paraiso)","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":147,"posted_date":"2009-11-13T00:20:12Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Praxedes Litardo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-10-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":400,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":41.57},{"due_date":"2010-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":46.57},{"due_date":"2010-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":47.75},{"due_date":"2010-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":49.62},{"due_date":"2010-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":50.23},{"due_date":"2010-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":51.65},{"due_date":"2010-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":52.82},{"due_date":"2010-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":59.79}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.57},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.57},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.75},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.62},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.23},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.65},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.82},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.79}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":41.57,"local_amount":41.57,"processed_date":"2009-12-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T13:27:31Z","rounded_local_amount":41.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110679517},{"amount":46.57,"local_amount":46.57,"processed_date":"2010-01-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:33:15Z","rounded_local_amount":46.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118074027},{"amount":47.75,"local_amount":47.75,"processed_date":"2010-02-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:07:06Z","rounded_local_amount":47.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123909994},{"amount":49.62,"local_amount":49.62,"processed_date":"2010-03-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T08:59:58Z","rounded_local_amount":49.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128945559},{"amount":50.23,"local_amount":50.23,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:17:57Z","rounded_local_amount":50.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136673922},{"amount":164.26,"local_amount":164.26,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:16:19Z","rounded_local_amount":164.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144708088}],"funded_date":"2009-11-15T22:09:37Z","paid_date":"2010-06-15T09:16:19Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Shelly Willard","image":null}},{"id":155580,"name":"Naomi","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Naomi T. is a 56-year-old woman living in the town of Auala 2.

He is 36 years old. Victorio is married and has 3 school-aged children. To make a living, Victorio owns and operates a business venture in the retail sector running a general store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling a variety of different products in the local community. Victorio has been engaged in his business for years and earns approximately 4,500 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Victorio joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Victorio is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Victorio from ASKI. He plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand his business.\r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She is 48 years old. Erlinda is married and has 9 adult-aged children. To make a living, Erlinda owns & operates a business venture in the retail sector running a sari-sari (variety) retail store.

Malipayon, Brgy. Banago, Bacolod City, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating two business ventures:  a general store and a pig fattening business. Her husband, Roel S., who is 47 years old, works as a driver to earn his living, and also helps in his wife's business activities.  They have four children who are 9 to 14 years old. \r\n\r\nAntonieta joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2010 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Antonieta has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. The additional working capital from her previous loan of PHP 5,000 helped her increase her monthly profit to PHP 10,000, improving the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her second loan, she is borrowing PHP 10,000, which she intends to use as additional capital to buy more stock for her general store so that she can continue to save for the future and send her children to school. Antonieta S. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

The members decided to give the group this name because they are ardent devotees of the saint San Judi\u00edtas who they celebrate through a yearly fiesta.  This group has eleven indigenous members who have dreams and ambitions.  They want to achieve their dreams through hard work and honesty.  They are people who are full of hopes and have goals to reach.  They are unassuming people and good friends to each other.  This is a group that would like to fulfil their dreams so that they can help their children to study and earn a living without forgetting their roots and origins.\r\n\r\nCarlos is the person who invited the other members to join this group as they are all neighbors and friends.  Carlos is 39 years old.  He works as a mechanic and has business premises which are one block from his home.  His son Ernesto helps him when he gets home from school as he really enjoys this work.  Carlos taught him to repair cars and recognize their parts and their purpose from a very young age.\r\n\r\nCarlos requested this loan to buy more spare parts as his stock is low and occasionally people come to buy parts from him and he doesn't have them.  He doesn't want to lose customers owing to a lack of parts.\r\n\r\nOne of Carlos' dreams is to have more merchandise in his repair shop as his customers trust what he sells them and the work that he does.  For their sake he would like to buy more merchandise and not have to delay the work that they provide him with.\r\n\r\nCarlos is very happy because every day he gains more customers who he provides with the service that they deserve.  This means that he can provide his wife Clara and his son Ernesto the best.  They both support him in the decisions that he makes.\r\n\r\nCarlos thanks Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad for the support that they have given both to himself and his fellow group members so that they can get ahead and fulfil their dreams."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4275,"image":{"id":858122,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Auto Repair","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to buy spare parts","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2011-09-07T08:40:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":4275,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Luis   Carlos ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ines  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Luisa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Carlos  ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rocio ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sabina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Soledad ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Librada ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Anayeli ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Olga ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Clemencia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-08-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":53000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":4275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":3312.5},{"due_date":"2011-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":3312.5},{"due_date":"2011-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":3312.5},{"due_date":"2011-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":3312.5},{"due_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":3312.5},{"due_date":"2011-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":3312.5},{"due_date":"2011-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":3312.5},{"due_date":"2011-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":3312.5},{"due_date":"2011-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":3312.5},{"due_date":"2011-11-04T07:00:00Z","amount":3312.5},{"due_date":"2011-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":3312.5},{"due_date":"2011-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":3312.5},{"due_date":"2011-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":3312.5},{"due_date":"2011-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":3312.5},{"due_date":"2011-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":3312.5},{"due_date":"2011-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":3312.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":267.19},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":267.19},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":267.18},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":267.19},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":267.19},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":267.19},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":267.18},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":267.19},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":267.19},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":267.19},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":267.18},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":267.19},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":267.19},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":267.19},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":267.18},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":267.19}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":1335.94,"local_amount":16562.5,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:11:38Z","rounded_local_amount":16624.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232807681},{"amount":1068.75,"local_amount":13250,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:22:44Z","rounded_local_amount":13299.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238618778},{"amount":1068.75,"local_amount":13250,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:04:25Z","rounded_local_amount":13299.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244573019},{"amount":801.56,"local_amount":9937.5,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:12:53Z","rounded_local_amount":9974.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250784742}],"funded_date":"2011-09-15T12:25:38Z","paid_date":"2012-01-15T10:12:53Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Oxnard","image":null}},{"id":336561,"name":"Youssef","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Youssef is a 45-year-old Lebanese married man and the father of three children.

A. is a citizen of the city of Yavan. He is 32 years old, married and has four children. He is unemployed. He earns an income by raising large-horned cattle and selling milk. Two of his cows have given birth so it is important that he increases the size of his cow barn. That is why he wants to receive a loan so that he can buy building materials. By building a strong cow barn he will be able to be well prepared for the winter and not worry that the cold weather would injure the cows. He plans to repay the loan within 12 months.<p><b>Translated from Russian by Maria Lyuksyutova, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\n\u0410\u0437\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0432

She has two children ages two and 18 years old.  Her oldest child is in school.  Her husband is a construction worker who works independently and is also sometimes contracted.  Veronica has worked as a domestic worker for over 20 years for different families.  She was given the opportunity to work as a domestic worker when she was a single mother who had been abandoned by her husband.  She had to pay for the necessities and this work has, until this day, allowed her to support her family.  Luckily she remarried and she now has a family.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":285235,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To purchase cooking oil, sugar and kerosene","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mwanza","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.516667 32.9","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-03-09T20:30:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Bahati","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-03-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-04-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:23:57Z","rounded_local_amount":52080,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027593},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-05-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:13:29Z","rounded_local_amount":52080,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613594},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-06-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:01:38Z","rounded_local_amount":52080,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010673},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-07-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:38:12Z","rounded_local_amount":52080,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63232959},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-08-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:52:21Z","rounded_local_amount":52080,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73664750},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-09-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T02:45:33Z","rounded_local_amount":52080,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87105470},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-10-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T06:26:29Z","rounded_local_amount":52080,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97022615},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-11-18T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:41:35Z","rounded_local_amount":52080,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103867864},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-12-18T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T16:44:30Z","rounded_local_amount":52080,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110757065},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-01-17T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:34:26Z","rounded_local_amount":52080,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118146177}],"funded_date":"2009-03-09T22:23:22Z","paid_date":"2010-02-15T12:34:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Adam Sutcliffe","image":null}},{"id":98061,"name":"Fortunata","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"\nLa socia FORTUNATA;

Saidakram is dedicated to agriculture and the sale of home-grown vegetables, which means that he can be around his family, helping to raise their quality of life and educate all his three children. Saidakram has been characterized as a person who is hard-working, since he has been working in agriculture since he was very young. This kind of work requires effort, dedication and above all, strength, as it can include heavy work, meaning that people get tired quickly. In spite of this, Saidakram is determined to raise the standard of living in his family, and to improve the quality of the seeds he cultivates. For this reason, he is asking for help in order to be able to receive more credit from IMON International.  <P>\r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International<P>\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and with its famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

su esposa que es la madre de sus 5 hijos, de los cuales viven con tres de ellos que lo apoyan en los trabajos agr\u00edcolas. La siembra y cosecha de papa es la actividad a la que se dedica diariamente desde hace 30 a\u00f1os, pero antes de acudir a su chacra alimenta a los animales que tiene como su burro y sus mulas, los cuales le son muy \u00fatiles para transportar los sacos durante la cosecha. Por ello que a  las 8.00am sus animales ya deben estar bien alimentados para que no sientan cansancio ni hambre durante la jornada de ida y vuelta a su almac\u00e9n. Despu\u00e9s de haber acumulado las papas, comienza la selecci\u00f3n con la ayuda de su esposa, y finalmente los transporta al mercado mayorista de la ciudad de Tarma. Milcerio ama la labor que realiza, puesto que sabe que gracias a ella obtendr\u00e1 el dinero para sostener a su familia. En los 30 a\u00f1os que lleva en esta actividad ha disfrutado de la abundancia de sus cosechas que le permitieron vivir temporadas de bonaza, como tambi\u00e9n de impotencia al ver que sus siembras se quedaban bajo el hielo y otras veces los gusanos malograban la totalidad de sus cultivos, pero esas circunstancias s\u00f3lo han sido pasajeras, pues no han mellado en su \u00e1nimo de seguir luchando para mantener a su familia. Este es el cuarto cr\u00e9dito de Milcerio con MFP, durante los anteriores ciclos demostr\u00f3 mucha responsabilidad en sus pagos, y para este ciclo se compromete seguir la misma din\u00e1mica, ya que los dem\u00e1s integrantes son muy buenos colaboradores para el progreso de su banco comunal. Los dos mil soles que solicita ser\u00e1n invertidos en la compra de fertilizantes qu\u00edmicos, para sus pr\u00f3ximas siembras.","en":"<p>Milcerio is 46 years old, he is a very sensible and responsible man. He lives happily with his wife, the mother of his 5 children, three of whom are still with them and help him work the fields. He sows and harvests potatoes, daily work that he has been carrying out for the last 30 years. But even before he starts tending to his fields he must feed the his donkey and his mules. They help him transport the large sacks of harvest.  By 8a.m. the animals must already be well fed so that they do not feel tired or become hundre during the trip to and from the silos. After having collected the potatoes he and his wife must go through a selection process, and only then will they transport them to the wholesale markets in the city of Tarma. Miclerio loves his work and it is thanks to this work that he obtains money to support his family. In the 30 years that he has been working he has enjoyed abundant harvests, giving him the opportunity to live through times of plenty. He has also seen harvests fall under a sheet of ice and other harvests that were completely spoiled by pests. But these times of hardship have been temporary and they have not impeded his will to keep struggling for the sake of his family. This is the fourth loan with MFP (Kiva Field Partner). In the past he has shown great responsibility in his payments and for this time around he promises to be equally responsible. The others inthe group are wonderful collaborators in the progress of their community bank. The two thousand soles he is requesting will be invested in the purchase of chemical fertilizers for this next harvest.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Erika Lindig, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":323698,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To purchase fertilizers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-05-26T12:40:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":675,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Milcerio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-05-06T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-02T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":675}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":675,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2009-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:30:00Z","rounded_local_amount":2028.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73641245}],"funded_date":"2009-05-26T15:18:38Z","paid_date":"2009-09-15T19:30:00Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":114445,"name":"Elisa Margarita","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Elisa Margarita L.

GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach.  Every client is trained in business management, basic health, life skills, financial management, profits and losses, and family values.  Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement.  GHAPE instills a sense of family and community within its clients and staff and has developed a strong bond of trust between the organization and its clients.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":363363,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Motorcycle Transport","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"Purchase of motorbike, licensing, documentation ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CM","country":"Cameroon","town":"Alabukam, Mankon, NW.
