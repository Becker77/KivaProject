She has 3 children and is married to a husband who is currently unemployed. She is a school teacher and would like to use this loan to buy more books for the children in her school and expand her business. She heard about K-MET because the school she teaches in is located next to the church where K-MET teaches community-based health workers. We had a chance to see her at work at the school and her children love her. When it comes time to journal, we will upload pictures of some of the children and a picture of the school.  Mercy says that she would like lenders to know that if you believe in something that is good, you can make it happen. <P>\r\n\r\nMercy recently joined the K-MET volunteer Community Health Worker (CHW) group in Kisumu, Kenya. As a CHW she will be trained by K-MET and will begin visiting members of her community who are sick with a variety of illnesses. Her work will include distributing Nutriflour (a vitamin-enriched flour produced by K-MET) to malnourished patients, providing reproductive health education, referring patients to local clinics and hospitals, and providing basic health

She earns her living by operating three business ventures:  a general store, hog raising and motorcycle transport. Her husband Osias, who is 42 years old, works as a laborer to earn his living. They have three children who are between 7 and 16 years old. Josefina joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2005 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 10 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Josefina has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 14,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 4,800, uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 11th loan, she is borrowing PHP 17,000, which she intends to use to buy stock for the general store so that she can continue to save up for her children's future education. Josefina is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

He is 43 years old and he is a very happy and hardworking man. He is married to Celsa who is 40 years old and their relationship produced 2 daughters, Karina, 16 years old, and Ana Maria, 13. They live together in a home that is their own in the district of Santa Rosa. Fabian started his adventure as an agriculturist since he was a boy on his parents' land. His passion for agriculture led him to acquire his own land where he has been working independently for the past 11 years. He cultivates cocoa, coffee, and coca leaves. During the harvest he has help from farm hands who can quickly harvest the product and he therefore is able to advance with his work. He feels a great sense of commitment to his work. It is thanks to his daily efforts that today he is able to enjoy the fruits that the plants give him. He has obtained good earnings for each kilogram of product he has sold. He says that the winter season is not his favorite because during those months insects and rain are in abundance and it prevents him from doing his work efficiently and the products of the plantations are damaged. \r\n\r\nThe loan which he requests will be used to acquire cocoa plants to graft them and take full advantage of the product when the weather is better. But his priority now is to purchase new land in order to expand his plantations and to increase production. This is his eighth loan through MFP (Kiva Field Partner) and he is committed to make all of his payments on time, especially because he wishes to access other loans in the future. He is a very well liked member of is communal bank. With the 500 nuevos soles which he requests, he will purchase cocoa plants to graft them and to take full advantage of the good weather season.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":742693,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase cocoa plants","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-03-31T11:30:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":200,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Fabian ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-03-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":200}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":200,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:42:29Z","rounded_local_amount":562.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244621123}],"funded_date":"2011-03-31T21:33:19Z","paid_date":"2011-12-15T10:42:29Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":291100,"name":"Dana Kerti Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jro Ayu Putu P.

She is a widow as her husband passed away after more than 15 years of marriage. She has 6 children and 3 grandchildren, but only the 3 youngest children (ranging from 14 to 8 years old) and the 3 grandchildren live with her. They all attend school, apart from the youngest grandchild who is only 3 years old.<p>Albertina moved with her family to Namaacha, a village bordering Swaziland, when she was little. She went to school until third grade, but stopped due to her family\u2019s difficult financial situation. She got pregnant with her first son at 17 years old and has been living with her future husband ever since, taking care of the house and the children.<p>Soon after Albertina\u2019s husband passed away in 2001, Albertina started to sell clothes in Namaacha. She has a stand at the local open market that is open twice a week (Wednesdays and Saturdays). During the other days of the week, Albertina sells from her house. The most sold items are sheets; each is sold for Mozambique Metical (MZN)15 or 30, depending on the quality and design. Albertina goes to Maputo to buy merchandise once a month, paying around MZN60 in transportation costs. At the market, Albertina makes between MZN300 and 1,500 per day, really depending on the season and weather conditions.<p>Albertina first heard of Hluvuku through a friend who was a client. This will be Albertina\u2019s second loan. The first loan was used to buy inventory and helped increase sales. Albertina was extremely happy with the loan, as it helped her buy basic needs for her children and also increase her monthly profits. This time Albertina intends to use the loan to buy winter clothes, as winter will soon start and she thinks she will be able to sell a lot.<p>In the future, Albertina would like to ask for a new loan to help her finish building a shop in front of her house, where she would be able to sell not only clothes, but also food and basic needs products. The picture shows Albertina with the sheets at her house."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":149593,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing

Askarali is a dynamic and ambitious young man, very professional and focused on his business. He has a business selling cement and feed for cattle in the neighborhood of \u201cDehkon\u201d market. He has been in this business for 4 years and has gained a rich experience. He has a special warehouse where he keeps his goods in safety. He knows how to store cement so that it doesn\u2019t deteriorate.<P>\r\n\r\n All this allows Askarali to make his business quite successful and it brings in stable income for his family. With the profit from his business he has been continuously supporting his 4 children with education and food. Today, knowing that the price of the cement is presently low but will increase soon for sure, he wants to purchase more goods to store up. For this reason he is asking for a loan of 3000 USD for the term of 12 months. Askarali expresses his gratitude to everyone supporting him.     <P>\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International<P>\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and with its famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, because they are deemed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro-leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the

She has a pair of 12-year-old twins, and a 3 year old; the twins are studying. She resides in the Memorial Sandino neighborhood. Her husband works as a conductor on the routes that transport thousands of Nicaraguans daily to their jobs. With much effort and in hopes of helping in her household, Erica took the initiative to begin selling clothing to help husband with expenses. She began this business with savings and later with loans from Afodenic. She has sold large quantities of clothing and cosmetics for ten years, and with this loan she will be able to invest in the purchase of assorted clothing and cosmetics to offer her clients, and this will also help her acquire new clients. She sells for cash payments or on credit. She thanks the Afodenic institution for the good that she has accomplished to date. In the future she hopes to continue making improvements to her home. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Mariela Cedeno, Kiva

Mr. Oeurn S. is a village bank president who has been selected by the members. He is a farmer who owns 1-hectar field to cultivate rice to earn for living. In this farming, he now faces a small problem because he does not have enough moN. to buy fertilizers to support the field so he decided to buy fertilizers to make his crop more productive and he also use the rest of the loan to buy piglets and pig food for breeding. His wife, Mrs. Teav Chantha, helps him on the farming. Mr. Oeurn S. is 25 years old and the father of a child who is too young to work or study because that child is on the age of a year. \n\nAll the members in this village bank loans are end-of-term loans so they are not required to pay any principal on the loan until the very end of the loan term. End-of-term (EoT) loans are AMK\u2019s main product because it is the most beneficial to Cambodia\u2019s poor. It allows them to repay portions of the principal whenever they are financially able to.

leader of a five-member group loan offered by ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.<p>\r\n\r\nVilma, who is married and has 2 school-aged children, owns and operates a general store whose income derives primarily from selling daily-use products such as shampoo, soap and toothpaste in the local community. Vilma has been engaged in her business for over 15 years and earns approximately 9,000 PHP a month.<p>\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Vilma joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Vilma is requesting a new loan, her third, of 7000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell.  She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay the tuition fees of her children. <p>\r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.<p>\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partners to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

With the help of her past 14 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Ligaya has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. \r\n\r\nHer previous loan of PHP 14,500 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 18,000, thus uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 15th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 15,000 which she intends to use as additional working capital so that she can continue to save up for the future of her family's needs. \r\n\r\nLigaya D. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). \r\n\r\nThrough the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.  \r\n\r\nHelp NWTF continue its mission to help the poorest in the Philippines by clicking the link to the NWTF Kiva lending team on Kiva.org to join our

She lives with her partner, 40 year-old David, and they have two children: 10 year-old Leydi and 2 year-old Jhosep.  They live together in their own home which is located in Quimbiri district.\r\n\r\nNora's parents taught her the value of work and the need to work hard to earn money since she was a little girl.  Nora's business activity is buying products from farmers, such as coffee, annatto, cacao and turmeric.  These are all products which are native to the rainforest area of the Apurimac River Valley.\r\n\r\nNora has been working for 14 years and she has the support of her partner who is in charge of loading and weighing the produce.  Nora then takes the produce and sells it to well-known wholesalers such as Cooperativa Agraria, Cacao Vrae and Machupichu who pay her a percentage for every kilogram of produce she delivers.  Nora's business makes her a good quantity of money each year.  However, January, February and March are rainy months and roads wash away.  This affects the journeys that she makes to transport her products.\r\n\r\nNora's plans are to continue working with the same determination in order to get the members of her family ahead in life.  She will use the loan she has requested as capital so that she can buy products from farmers.  This is Nora's 11th loan from MFP and she has been very punctual in repaying her previous loans.  Nora is a member of a community bank.  However, because she is a member who repays her loans punctually, she is also able to access an individual loan."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":742740,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to

They had great expectations to be successful in their work.

His family is made up of his wife and their 4 children, aged from 26 to 35. They have especially seen improvements in the condition of their home.\r\n\r\nThis Kiva loan is the first loan that Rogelio has had through Fundacion Mario Santo Domingo (Kiva Field Partner). With it he will purchase a variety of merchandise, such as eye glasses, t-shirts, hooks, school supplies, sandals, and ladies' accessories. His goal for the future is to restart production, especially because he has the infrastructure ready to use, and to sell in retail and through other merchants. His greatest challenge is his working capital. IN comparison with the competition the business is very small to be able to respond to client demands in an opportune manner. While he works on expanding, he directs all of his efforts to maintain his business profitable. Currently that represents a profit margin of no less than 50%. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":771786,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to purchase a variety of merchandise, such as eye glasses, t-shirts, hooks, school supplies, sandals, and ladies' accessories.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Soledad-Atlantico","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2011-05-20T15:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":600,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rogelio","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-05-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1070000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71267},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81520},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83082},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84674},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86297},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87951},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":89637},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91355},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":93106},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":94891},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96709},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":109511}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.96},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.71},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.59},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.48},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.39},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.32},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.27},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.22},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.21},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.21},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.23},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.41}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":39.96,"local_amount":71267,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:08:57Z","rounded_local_amount":72532.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216509534},{"amount":92.3,"local_amount":164602,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-17T08:01:28Z","rounded_local_amount":167524.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227320289},{"amount":47.48,"local_amount":84674,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:05:56Z","rounded_local_amount":86177.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232803419},{"amount":48.39,"local_amount":86297,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:59:07Z","rounded_local_amount":87829.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244568460},{"amount":99.58,"local_amount":177588,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:06:59Z","rounded_local_amount":180741.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250779803},{"amount":51.23,"local_amount":91355,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T10:21:42Z","rounded_local_amount":92977.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257188212},{"amount":105.42,"local_amount":187997,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T09:30:01Z","rounded_local_amount":191335.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270038502},{"amount":54.23,"local_amount":96709,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:42:14Z","rounded_local_amount":98426.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276650693},{"amount":61.41,"local_amount":109511,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T16:07:40Z","rounded_local_amount":111455.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283140320}],"funded_date":"2011-06-02T13:33:00Z","paid_date":"2012-06-15T16:07:40Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":303410,"name":"Hasifa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Hasifa lives in the city of Kampala, Uganda.

He joined One Acre Fund for One Acre Fund\u2019s best prices and to ensure food security for his family and later educate them.

Before joining One Acre Fund,  Dismus was only able to harvest 2 \u00bd bags of maize on \u00bd acre of land.\r\n\r\nWith this loan, One Acre Fund will purchase fertilizer, seeds, and other important inputs to distribute to Dismus and his group during Kenya\u2019s next planting season in February 2012. The distribution of farming inputs is part of One Acre Fund\u2019s integrated agriculture package, which includes training, reliable input supply (such as fertilizer and seeds), credit and insurance.\r\n\r\nWith income from his maize sales, Dismus will educate his children and invest in raising livestock.\r\n\r\nIn 2012, the members of Nanjikabe SHG group will each plant maize plots between \u00bd and 1 acre of land.\r\n\r\nIn the photograph above, Dismus is pictured with his group members. The field officer appears on the far left.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":914945,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To source farming inputs, such as seeds and fertilizer, at low prices for the 2012 planting season.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Chwele","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2011-11-15T23:40:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":475,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Margrit ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dismus ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Julius","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Moses","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jane","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-11-13T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":45150,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45150}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":475}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":475,"local_amount":45150,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-27T10:15:52Z","rounded_local_amount":45694.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315680712}],"funded_date":"2011-11-18T20:12:39Z","paid_date":"2012-11-27T10:15:52Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":360814,"name":"Shahera","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Shahera, 24, is married and has one son.

He is a humble farmer dedicated to growing produce such as potatoes, onions, wheat, corn, and other crops. He is gratified with the harvest of his land and wants to harvest even more. However, he needs to invest money for a larger harvest with better results because vegetables of better quality will increase his income from sales. Norboy also raises livestock. Now he wants to increase his crop production and to purchase more cattle to breed, so he has applied to IMON International for a loan of 3000 Somoni (US $875) for the term of 12 months.  \n \nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International:\n\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes being a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and its famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists, and poets (including Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi, and many others). The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture, and Central Asian traditions. \n\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still lives in abject poverty. \n\nIMON's History\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He purchases fish from the OFP fish-factory. Here in Kisumu, Thaddeus transports people on the back of his bike, known here as boda-boda.

He is not married, but the need for an additional source of income for his large family forced him to start his own business. Burkhon has about two years of experience in the public transportation field. Demands for his service are rather high since there are so many people who need it. \r\n<p>\r\nBurkhon must maintain his vehicle since this is the tool of his trade. So now Burkhon is counting on your help. He is requesting a loan of $3000 USD to purchase spare parts and winter tires for his microbus. With your support, Burkhon will continue to prosper in his business and so support his brother and sister in their education. \r\n<p>\r\nAbout Tajikistan: \r\n<p>\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi and Rumi. The country is home to epic mountain passes, communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture and new Western cultures and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war that ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R. further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\nAbout IMON International:\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients have access to reasonable financial services.

He is 46 years old, married, and the father of 5 children who are 17, 14, 9, 6, and 1 years old.  The youngest two children don't go to school.  He only studied through 10th grade due to lack of funds.  He lives in the service worker houses with his family and even supports his mother in Beira by sending money.\r\n\r\nHe left Beira for Maputo in order to continue with his studies in 1982 and ended up making a home there.  He has worked for the I.P.U. (Inter-Parliamentary Union) for more than 21 years as a driver and mechanic.  His working schedule is from 7:30am to 3:30pm.  He receives a monthly salary of 2,500 MZN and receives 2,000 MZN for services for third parties.  He uses this for household expenses and even saves some in his bank account. \r\n\r\nHe has never had loans through banks.  He found out about Hluvuku through service colleagues who are also clients of this institution.  This is his 4th loan, which has a value of 15,000 MZN.  He plans to use this to buy construction materials (beams, panes, cement, steel, sand, and windows) in order to continue to build his home.  The previous loans were for 6,000 MZN, 10,000 MZN, and 13,000 MZN, all for the same purpose.\r\n\r\nIn the future, he would like to ask for more loans in order to continue to build his home, move out of the service worker houses, and provide better living conditions for his family.\r\n \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Erika Korowin, Kiva

Lo que m\u00e1s le gusta de su trabajo es cultivar sus tierras y lo hace con mucho esmero, lleva 4 a\u00f1os realizando esta actividad y a\u00fan sigue cuidando sus plantaciones de la plaga de insectos. Con el tiempo, desea comprar m\u00e1s tierras para incrementar su producci\u00f3n. Este es el octavo cr\u00e9dito con MFP y esta ahorrando para pagar sus cuotas a tiempo, ya que no quiere causarle problemas a las socias de su banco comunal, donde se siente muy contenta. Con los mil doscientos nuevos soles solicitados, comprar\u00e1 m\u00e1s abono y fertilizantes para sus cultivos.\n\n","en":"\r\nMargarita, 24, is a young, unassuming, hard working mother.

In 2001, Halimatu established her provision shop business. She began her business because she gained experience from her husband and the two decided that she should start her own business in a new location. Working seven days a week and 12 hours a day, she earns about Le 1,000,000 every month from this business. She would like a loan in the amount of Le 4,000,000. Halimatu has already received and successfully repaid two loans, and now requires a new loan in order to buy additional provisions such as sugar, sardines, margarine, milk, tea and coffee for her business. She hopes that this loan will enable her to increase her monthly profits by approximately Le 200,000. In the future, Halimatu plans to build a house of her own.

Silvia has used recent loans to purchase necessary boat supplies, including a motor, fishing net, etc. The boat is used up to five days at a time. When it returns, Silva and the crew share the earnings from fish sales. Silvia earns between 800 to 2000 soles (about $265-$665) each time the boat returns, depending on the catch. Silvia also keeps another smaller fishing boat on the lake in the town of Yarinacocha, where she lives. Silvia's fishing enterprise is going well.  Summer is the best season for catching fish.\r\n\r\nSilvia requests a 3000 soles loan.  Half will be used to purchase another net maD. of a heavier material; better for fishing in the winter season.

Sadiya is a hard working woman and since 2001 has dedicated herself to selling a variety of vegetables. She characterized herself as happy and humble. She started her business with her savings which she had accumulated over a long period of time. Sadiya is the mother of 5 children that she would like to offer an education. Her biggest dream is to prepare her children to have professions so they don't have to suffer like she did since childhood working hard labor. To realize this dream, Sadiya now requests a loan of $800 USD. With this loan she wants to buy more goods to increase her earnings.  \n\n\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\n\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is married to Mr. TOKPANOU Jacques, an employee at the Port of Cotonou, the economic capital of Benin.  Berthe has six children, of whom some are in school.  All of the children live together with their parents.  \r\n\r\nBerthe helps out her husband where it concerns the different family expenses.  She is a gardener who sells her vegetables at the Ganhi market in Cotonou and who also delivers them to retailers.  Dantokpa, the international market of Benin, is where she buys seeds for planting.   She has been in this business for about twenty years and has already obtained an ALID\u00e9 loan, which she has repaid.  It enabled her to build up her business a little.  \r\n\r\nBerthe has the ambition of expanding her garden and selling her vegetables in bulk.  This will enable her to increase her revenues and to address her needs.  She is requesting a second loan from ALID\u00e9 for these reasons.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva

called San Miguel Soyaltepec.  This community has a very large lake which provides a lot of fish and work each year.  It is also well known because the Cerro de Oro hydroelectric dam is located there.  This community is where Evaristo A. lives.  He is a young man of 21 who is single and studied up to the sixth year of high school.  \r\n\r\nEvaristo tells us that he left school a couple of years ago.  He needed to work in order to help his parents with their household expenses.  He also tells us that he has a small sales location in his home where he sells groceries but, owing to a lack of money, he had to close it.

He is currently in his 4th year of high school.\r\nHer dream is to improve the quality of the clothing she makes. There are many seamstresses who offer services but don't care about making the customer happy. Lucila hopes her child takes over the business and that she gains the necessary knowledge to be able to run the business. She hopes she becomes successful in life and this would be the perfect career that would make her mother proud.  Lucida does clothing repair and sells clothes.  She currently runs her business from her home, located in Rpto San Carlos 2 Calle.\r\nShe's had her business for 6 years. She began this business going because of the economic need she had at the moment. At the time she suggested making the uniforms for her child's school. (La Asuncion), the school loved the idea and gave her the task of creating these. She was able to increase her earning a bit at a time.\r\nShe's been getting her finance thru Fundaci\u00f3n Leon 2000. At this time she hopes to get a loan in order to purchase: thread, zippers, needles,fabric, scissors, and other things needed to make the uniforms. Some customers have already placed their uniform orders for school year about to come.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Maria Peterson, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":260101,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Tailoring","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"materials for making school uniforms","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Leon","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.435556 -86.879444","type":"point"}},"partner_id":96,"posted_date":"2009-01-23T15:00:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":750,"lender_count":28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lucila Berta ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":14800,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":1345.45},{"due_date":"2009-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1345.45},{"due_date":"2009-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1345.45},{"due_date":"2009-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1345.45},{"due_date":"2009-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1345.45},{"due_date":"2009-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1345.45},{"due_date":"2009-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1345.45},{"due_date":"2009-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":1345.45},{"due_date":"2009-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":1345.45},{"due_date":"2009-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":1345.45},{"due_date":"2009-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":1345.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":68.18},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":68.18},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.18},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.18},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.18},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.18},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.18},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.18},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.18},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.18},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.2}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":68.18,"local_amount":1345.45,"processed_date":"2009-02-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T08:41:52Z","rounded_local_amount":1374.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20400003},{"amount":95.23,"local_amount":1879.11,"processed_date":"2009-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T18:38:02Z","rounded_local_amount":1919.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27092001},{"amount":41.13,"local_amount":811.79,"processed_date":"2009-04-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T16:39:58Z","rounded_local_amount":829.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35985384},{"amount":49.23,"local_amount":971.54,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T23:11:51Z","rounded_local_amount":992.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44446000},{"amount":62.98,"local_amount":1242.86,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T20:42:18Z","rounded_local_amount":1269.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52956641},{"amount":92.33,"local_amount":1821.95,"processed_date":"2009-07-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-05T09:31:08Z","rounded_local_amount":1860.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":66055575},{"amount":68.18,"local_amount":1345.45,"processed_date":"2009-08-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T15:29:56Z","rounded_local_amount":1374.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73599692},{"amount":68.18,"local_amount":1345.45,"processed_date":"2009-09-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T17:57:24Z","rounded_local_amount":1374.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87035585},{"amount":25.95,"local_amount":512.08,"processed_date":"2009-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T21:43:22Z","rounded_local_amount":522.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96947994},{"amount":110.41,"local_amount":2178.82,"processed_date":"2009-11-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T12:32:45Z","rounded_local_amount":2225.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103789968},{"amount":68.2,"local_amount":1345.5,"processed_date":"2009-12-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T13:32:12Z","rounded_local_amount":1374.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110680666}],"funded_date":"2009-01-23T17:36:27Z","paid_date":"2010-01-15T13:32:12Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Maria Peterson","image":58600}},{"id":89545,"name":"N\u00e9h\u00e9mie Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Deborah is a 42-year-old woman with five children.

She left him in the care of his grandmother and three uncles. \r\n\r\nFidel says that he's happy with his work and thanks to his effort and sacrifice he's earning many projects.\r\n\r\nHe would like a loan to buy shoes and uniforms to sell.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Sarah Bishop, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":293962,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Traveling Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Buy shoes and uniforms to sell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PY","country":"Paraguay","town":"Carapegua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-25.8 -57.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":58,"posted_date":"2009-03-26T07:20:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":800,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Fidel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-02-26T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PYG","disbursal_amount":4000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":400000},{"due_date":"2009-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":400000},{"due_date":"2009-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":400000},{"due_date":"2009-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":400000},{"due_date":"2009-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":400000},{"due_date":"2009-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":400000},{"due_date":"2009-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":400000},{"due_date":"2009-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":400000},{"due_date":"2009-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":400000},{"due_date":"2009-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":400000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":80}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":80,"local_amount":400000,"processed_date":"2009-03-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T18:54:00Z","rounded_local_amount":411200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27094620},{"amount":80,"local_amount":400000,"processed_date":"2009-04-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T19:42:19Z","rounded_local_amount":411200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35988111},{"amount":80,"local_amount":400000,"processed_date":"2009-05-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T23:26:14Z","rounded_local_amount":411200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44569257},{"amount":80,"local_amount":400000,"processed_date":"2009-06-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T20:58:44Z","rounded_local_amount":411200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52959515},{"amount":80,"local_amount":400000,"processed_date":"2009-07-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-20T09:06:02Z","rounded_local_amount":411200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63176786},{"amount":80,"local_amount":400000,"processed_date":"2009-08-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T15:49:39Z","rounded_local_amount":411200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73602397},{"amount":80,"local_amount":400000,"processed_date":"2009-09-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T18:32:58Z","rounded_local_amount":411200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87038627},{"amount":80,"local_amount":400000,"processed_date":"2009-10-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T22:04:34Z","rounded_local_amount":411200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96951092},{"amount":80,"local_amount":400000,"processed_date":"2009-11-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T12:39:05Z","rounded_local_amount":411200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103793243},{"amount":80,"local_amount":400000,"processed_date":"2009-12-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T13:46:19Z","rounded_local_amount":411200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110683998}],"funded_date":"2009-03-26T13:46:23Z","paid_date":"2010-01-15T13:46:19Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sarah Bishop","image":107465}},{"id":101833,"name":"Ilqar","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ilqar A. is a 28-year-old trader who has been selling food products in his own store for the last eight years.

Hajara doesn\u2019t take care of any additional family members.  The family gets two meals a day. She resides and works in a semi-urban area in the outskirts of Kampala and works two days a week. Hajara sells to all categories of people. Hajara deals in cattle. She buys cows from villages and sells them to meat packers and at times to Kampala city abattoir. She incurs extra transport costs to and from the villages. The major challenges she faces in her business are seasonality and the increasing prices of cattle. Hajara has been in this business for two years. She first dealt in tomatoes.  She has been with MCDT for seven years, servicing her 14th loan working with the same group mates. She wants to use this loan to buy more cattle for resale.

Sarah, a 30-year-old evergreen entrepreneurial upstart, being that she is only five years into her bar business in Kiduusu, Lugazi.

She has been in business for more than 35 years.  Bertila started selling fruits, but now she sells gelatins and desserts that she prepares herself.  The main piece of equipment that she uses for work is her refrigerator.  Every morning she sells these desserts as a street vendor.  Bertila says the days when she sells the most are during the summer season.  She feels very motivated after several hours of walking because she gets to return home without any gelatins and with all the money she has earned in her hands.  These funds go toward covering her household expenses.  Her wish is to improve her business with new implements.  \r\n<p>\r\nThis is her seventh loan with MFP.  Bertila is very happy to know that she has financial backing, which is why she has already proven herself to be responsible with her payments.  In addition, she is glad to be part of her Communal Bank because all of the members are responsible and cooperative people.

For over a year now, Hellen has been running her own poultry-rearing business to make a living.          \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Hellen is now requesting a loan of 200,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to purchase more chicken for rearing, and Hellen hopes that the expansion will increase her business profits and allow her to afford to buy sufficient food and, in the future, pay for her university studies.\r\n\r\nNote to lenders: BRAC Uganda has recently begun posting a new loan product to Kiva which funds young entrepreneurs in BRAC\u2019s Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program.  This Kiva borrower is receiving a new ELA loan. The ELA program first provides disadvantaged adolescents, usually girls who are out of school, with livelihood training and financial literacy skills.  Afterward, ELA participants can receive microfinance loans to expand their small businesses.  These loans offer adolescents a unique chance to access finance at a young age and improve their prospects for the future, and target a segment of the population not typically served by traditional microfinance.  Kiva is privileged to partner with BRAC Uganda in posting these new loans, and give Kiva lenders the opportunity to fund deserving young entrepreneurs and support a promising new sector in microfinance.\r\n

Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and local community members. She earns a minimum of 400 PHP in sales every day.\r\n<br>To help her continue to operate her business, Beatriz is requesting a loan of 39,000 PHP. She will use the loan to buy more groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.

Called a chiya pasal, these tea shops make a sweet, milky tea that can be purchased for a few cents a cup.  With a Kiva loan, BPW's borrowers are able to keep their store shelves stocked while increasing their profit margins by buying in greater volume. \r\n\r\nThis loan was administered by Kiva's local partner MFI, Patan Business and Professional Women.
