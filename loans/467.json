For three years she has been running the business, chatting with customers, and buying supplies. When one steps inside the store, it\u2019s hard to believe Livia began so humbly. Before her grocery store, Livia was selling fruits from a small cart just outside a busy Ayacuchan market. It is an exceptionally difficult way to make a living and lacks the permanence and consistency necessary to support a family. This is why, when Livia\u2019s second daughter was born, she decided to leave fruits behind and open a grocery store from her home. She began with only 300 Nuevo Soles in her pocket (about $100 USD), and with this she was able to buy 15 lbs. each of rice, oil, flour and a few other staple food items. It certainly wasn\u2019t much, but little by little, Livia was able to save up her money, accumulate capital, and today she has an entire grocery store filled with large varieties of foods, beverages, and household items. \r\n<p>\r\nA principal element in the success of Livia\u2019s grocery store has been her village bank. When she began with 300 Nuevo Soles, it was without any economic help. However, as soon as she joined her bank and began to take out loans, she was allowed incredible economic opportunities on which she capitalized with efficiency. Her village bank also taught her how to save her money formally in an account, instead of in her home where it is very difficult to save. Due to such lessons and opportunities, Livia is able to look forward to greater aspirations for her business and family. Professionally, Livia says she would love to renovate her store and maybe one day open in a new location in the city. As far as her family of 2 daughters and a husband is concerned, she plans to renovate their home from clay and straw thatching to sturdier and more comfortable materials. \r\n<p>\r\nLivia is requesting a loan of $1000. With this money, she will be able to buy and sell more of everything she stocks in her store, thus attracting more clients and earning greater profits."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":84975,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Increase the amount and variety of goods to sell.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":70,"posted_date":"2007-11-18T23:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":30,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Livia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-12-03T17:03:51Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2997,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":749.25},{"due_date":"2008-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":749.25},{"due_date":"2008-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":749.25},{"due_date":"2008-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":749.25}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":250}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":250,"local_amount":749.25,"processed_date":"2008-01-03T10:22:48Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-03T10:27:23Z","rounded_local_amount":749.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":107579},{"amount":250,"local_amount":749.25,"processed_date":"2008-02-03T10:15:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-03T10:27:23Z","rounded_local_amount":749.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":127468},{"amount":250,"local_amount":749.25,"processed_date":"2008-03-03T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-03T10:27:23Z","rounded_local_amount":749.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":148191},{"amount":250,"local_amount":749.25,"processed_date":"2008-04-03T10:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-03T10:27:23Z","rounded_local_amount":749.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172614}],"funded_date":"2007-11-19T17:03:51Z","paid_date":"2008-04-03T10:10:38Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":28502,"name":"Sophal","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"<p>Mrs. A.

He sells in Kabala and sometimes in Bo and Kenema, both larger cities in southern and eastern Sierra Leone. Prices for cattle in the villages vary depending on the size of the cattle (between Le 70,000 and Le 90,000). He then sells the cattle at prices between Le 80,000.00 and 110,000.00.\r\n\r\n<p>Sometimes in his business, Yaya encounters some challenges. Challenges include slow sales, sick or dead cattle and theft. In certain cases, however, Yaya can overcome the challenge of a sick animal by taking it to the veterinarian.

She buys and sells cattle. Until now this has been the most important source of income for her. Her work consists of raising beef cattle and, after fattening them, she sells at the best price and makes a profit. In the future, she wants to start another business. In the meantime she will continue dedicating herself to cattle-raising. \r\n<p>\r\nRight now she wishes to expand her business and purchase more cattle. This is the reason that Saodat has asked for a loan of $600. \r\n<p>\r\nBy helping in this loan, you could become an important part in Saodat's family's life: she deeply appreciates the trust and support you are giving her.  \r\n<p>\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n<p>\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes being a key post along the Silk Road and the site of the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to epic mountain passes, communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 percent of the country is mountainous and only 7 percent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\nIMON's History\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Two of her children are grown, and they work and support her as much as possible.  Her younger child goes to school.  Her husband is a farmer and they all live together in their own house.\r\n\r\nFor ten years she has been working as a seamstress.  She makes sure to take good care of her customers so that they are satisfied with her good work.  Gladis considers the business to be profitable because she has a good range of regular customers who appreciate her work and recommend her to other people.  Also, she takes advantage of being close to an educational institution by selling fruit juice in front of her house.  This is going very well.\r\n\r\nIn the future Gladis would like to have a business selling groceries.\r\n\r\nThis is her fifth loan with MFP.  What she likes about her community bank is that all of the members are responsible and there is much camaraderie among them.\r\n\r\nWith the money she is asking for she will buy textile materials to make different articles of clothing, which she calculates will cost 500 PEN.  With the rest of the money she will buy construction materials to make some repairs on her house.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":353764,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Tailoring","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"Buy textile materials and fix her house","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-07-18T16:20:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gladis","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-06-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":152.59},{"due_date":"2009-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":155.04},{"due_date":"2009-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":162.61},{"due_date":"2009-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":169.33},{"due_date":"2009-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":176.82},{"due_date":"2009-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":183.61}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.41},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.26},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.91},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.27},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":61.89},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":64.26}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":53.41,"local_amount":152.59,"processed_date":"2009-07-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:45:34Z","rounded_local_amount":162.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63212018},{"amount":54.26,"local_amount":155.04,"processed_date":"2009-08-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:28:14Z","rounded_local_amount":165.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73641553},{"amount":56.91,"local_amount":162.61,"processed_date":"2009-09-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:40:54Z","rounded_local_amount":173.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87080993},{"amount":59.27,"local_amount":169.33,"processed_date":"2009-10-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:15:58Z","rounded_local_amount":180.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96997132},{"amount":61.89,"local_amount":176.82,"processed_date":"2009-11-25T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:56:04Z","rounded_local_amount":188.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103842488},{"amount":64.26,"local_amount":183.61,"processed_date":"2009-12-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T15:23:55Z","rounded_local_amount":195.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734066}],"funded_date":"2009-07-19T13:16:42Z","paid_date":"2010-01-15T15:23:55Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ginny Kalish"}},{"id":126829,"name":"Mary","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mary is a member of Tujikomboe Group in Msamvu, Morogoro.

As parents, they want to send their children to school and have them finish their studies.  \r\n\r\nThe main source of their income is through farming. Her husband cultivates their farm lot by planting a variety of vegetables and rice. Since income from farming is seasonal, she is engaged in selling frozen foods in their village for additional income. She is now borrowing a loan of PHP5,000.00 from KIVA lenders to be used to purchase more frozen foods that she will sell in their village.  She is thankful for this financial assistance because she has the opportunity to improve her small business.

Khudoidod is married and has seven children. He has always been a hard-working man who has made sure, from a young age, that his family never goes without their daily bread.\r\n\r\nKhudoidod has a grocery store where he sells different kinds of foodstuffs. With a starting capital of $100 USD, thanks to his perseverance and dedication, he began this enterprise four years ago. Over time he expanded his business and today this business has become domestic as his children and wife are also engaged in it.\r\n\r\nToday Khudoidod needs to buy additional foodstuffs to increase the range of his selling goods. With this purpose in mind, he is requesting a loan of 1,250 USD. He is ready to work even harder, to make sacrifices, and to push every once in a while to achieve his goal and become a successful entrepreneur.\r\n\r\nWe believe Khudoidod\u2019s perseverance and clear vision will become key success factors in his small business.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>More about Tajikistan and IMON International<\/b>\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is 37 years old and is the group leader of a 9-member group loan offered by ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is Fatima A.'s Group.\r\n\r\nFatima is married and has 4 school-aged children. To make a living, Fatima owns and operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising livestock. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from raising pigs for fattening and for sale. Fatima has been engaged in her business for over 3 years and earns approximately 3000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Fatima joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Fatima has successfully repaid a previous loan of 7,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase baby livestock to raise and sell in the future. Fatima has now requested a new loan of 8000 PHP which will be used to purchase livestock feed and other supplies. This loan will be the fifth loan taken out by Fatima from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

U., 19, is the youngest member of this group. He\u2019s a resident of Karabalta and lives with his seventeen-year-old sister, who is financially dependent on him. Azamat is a part-time student at a local university, and when he\u2019s free from studies, he works in a local market selling vegetables. He has done this for two years and says that it gets frustrating sometimes as he faces challenges such as perishable products, weather conditions and inflation. He believes that the secret of success in retail is high quality, so he tries to deliver wholesale goods on time and at a more affordable price than his competitors. \r\n\r\nThe idea for the business came from Azamat\u2019s mother, who helped him start it by buying three sacks of potatoes. Since then Azamat has achieved good results. He\u2019s earned enough to pay his university tuition and has applied for a loan from Kiva, because he would like to purchase a small shop. Working in an open air market makes it more difficult for him to deliver his services, especially in cold winter conditions. Teenage labor has increased recently in Kyrgyzstan. The causes are few opportunities to get a college education and the availability of low-paid jobs.\r\n\r\n         --- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance (MBF), a young, ambitious and socially-focused Microfinance Institution in Kyrgyzstan.

Despite her sadness she continues work on behalf of her two children, Fernando and Sandra, and take care of them from her home in Uni\u00f3n Palomar, which is located in the central Peruvian jungle.  Patricia grows coffee and bananas on three hectares of farmland that she owns in the upper district of her community.  She already has eight years of experience and has been able to generate steady income throughout that time.  Patricia sells her coffee beans at the Sanchirio Palomar Cooperative, but whenever she has a large harvest, she will also sell to brokers who come to her farm so that they can buy coffee directly from her.  What she enjoys most about her work is being able to spend the bulk of her time in the field.  \u201cI hate the bustle of the city,\u201d says Patricia.  She plans to invest a large portion of her earnings in the acquisition of more farmland so that she can provide for her children\u2019s future.  \r\n<p>\r\nPatricia is a member of the Communal Bank \u201cDesarrollnado Para El Futuro de Prisma\u201d (Developing for the Future of Prisma).

The animals are fed a diet of balanced feed and natural grasses so that they will produce a good amount of milk, which is offered to the local residents or taken to the market in Lambayeque to sell.  Mar\u00eda has an established customer base that is of good quality because of the milk she offers.  With the income, she is able to meet her household obligations.  \r\n<p>\r\nMar\u00eda is requesting a loan from Edpyme Alternativa in the amount of 1500 PEN through its Seed Capital Program.  The money will be used to buy animals of other species (specifically chickens) and the respective feed for her cows in order to increase milk production.  This will allow Mar\u00eda to obtain the best price for her products so that she can repay the loan and improve her standard of living.  \r\n<p>\r\nMar\u00eda is a hardworking and responsible person.  The only thing she wants is to see her business grow so that she can acquire more household comforts for herself and her husband.   \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":840214,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy chickens and cattle feed.

The two siblings have been operating their dirt hauling business for two years. Currently they have two horses and carts but would like to buy two more.

Thi Nguyen, 50 years old, has gone through four rounds of funding.  Her family\u2019s finances have improved markedly, resulting from the bold move to invest in raising livestock and expanding the livestock operations.  In the first round of funding, not yet familiar with the weekly repayment structure, the family borrowed a very conservative amount of 2,000,000 VND.  After seeing that the method of weekly repayment fit their needs well, in subsequent rounds of funding Mrs. Nguyen consistently borrowed higher amounts.  Her experience in the keeping of livestock also improved with time, so the family did not encounter many difficulties in this business.  Mrs. Nguyen and her husband has 3 children, one of which is grown and 2 still live at home.  The grown child has found work that pays 2,000,000 VND a month.  In this round of funding the family is requesting 15,000,000 VND to invest in pigs and fixing up the pens.  Their total income is 4,000,000 VND per month.  \r\n<p><b>Translated from Vietnamese by Chi Nguyen, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\nTham gia v\u00e0o Qu\u1ef9 n\u0103m 2004, Ch\u1ecb Nguy\u1ec5n Th\u1ecb Li\u1ec5u 50 tu\u1ed5i, tr\u1ea3i qua 4 v\u00f2ng v\u1ed1n vay c\u1ee7a Qu\u1ef9 kinh t\u1ebf gia \u0111\u00ecnh ch\u1ecb \u0111\u00e3 thay \u0111\u1ed5i r\u00f5 r\u1ec7t, t\u1eeb suy ngh\u0129 m\u1ea1nh gi\u1ea1n vay v\u1ed1n v\u1ec1 \u0111\u1ea7u t\u01b0 ch\u0103n nu\u00f4i v\u00e0 m\u1edf r\u1ed9ng m\u00f4 h\u00ecnh ch\u0103n nu\u00f4i, v\u00f2ng v\u1ed1n \u0111\u1ea7u ti\u00ean do ch\u01b0a quen v\u1edbi ph\u01b0\u01a1ng th\u1ee9c tr\u1ea3 tu\u1ea7n n\u00ean gia \u0111\u00ecnh ch\u1ecb vay m\u1ee9c r\u1ea5t khi\u00eam t\u1ed1n l\u00e0 2.000.000\u0111.

They live in traditional families with their husbands, co-wives and children in the village of Konobougou in the Baroueli prefecture (in Mali\u2019s S\u00e9gou region). They run a business mainly selling food spices and traditional beauty products (incense, etc.). Brought together through neighborhood ties and friendship, they have been working with Soro Yiriwaso for one year and are on their third group loan. All previous loans were repaid without problem. They stock up on raw materials in Konobougou on market days, buying spices from wholesalers from S\u00e9gou and incense primarily from wholesalers from Bamako.  They sell at the same market in Konobougou, either at stalls or by walking around, and do this throughout the year. Their customers are women who sell to neighboring villages or women from Konobougou. The group plans to buy 15 kg of spices (pepper, abutilon, laurel, etc.) at CFA 2,000\/kg to sell at CFA 2,500\/kg, hence a weekly profit of CFA 7,500, and incense ingredients (2 kg of magnonkis\u00e8ni, 5 kg of gueni, and 4 bottles of perfume) at a cost of CFA 25,000, which would yield a profit of CFA 30,000 per month.

Este es su 5to pr\u00e9stamo con  MFP, y en todo este tiempo ha demostrado pagar sus cuotas responsablemente. El dinero que solicita es para la compra de fertilizantes e insecticidas para la buena producci\u00f3n de sus frutas. ","en":"Margarita is 40; she has been living with her life partner for 25 years and she has 5 children. With her partner, she tends several hectares of fruit trees and a smaller area under coffee; January to March is the harvest season, and they try to earn as much as possible as capital for their next crop.\r\n<p>\r\n Margarita gets up at 6.00 a.m. to attend to the house. Then, around 10.00, she prepares lunch for her partner and herself. This is the time of the citrus harvest and there is a lot of demand since it is summertime in the capital city; winter is the time of the banana and avocado harvests. \r\n<p>\r\nMargarita likes farming as it is very profitable at certain times of year, enabling them to pay for their children's education and cover other household expenses. Margarita is very active in her community bank; in the last period she acted as controller, overseeing the procedures and management by the other group members. \r\n<p>\r\nThis is her fifth loan from MFP; she has always repaid her loans promptly. The loan will be used to buy fertilizer and insecticide to enhance the fruit crop.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by John Rynne, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":925,"image":{"id":274371,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Buy fertilizer and insecticide","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-02-21T07:50:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":925,"lender_count":31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Margarita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-02-13T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":3000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":925}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":308.33,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2009-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:30:37Z","rounded_local_amount":1003.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73640505},{"amount":616.67,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2009-10-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:05:04Z","rounded_local_amount":2007.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96996424}],"funded_date":"2009-02-21T10:52:38Z","paid_date":"2009-11-16T03:05:04Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"John Rynne","image":161916}},{"id":94077,"name":"Conscience Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Les femmes du groupe Conscience, avec  en moyenne 23 ans et 3 enfants, vivent dans des familles traditionnelles \u00e9largies dans le village de Koumantou  pr\u00e9fecture de Bougouni (troisi\u00e8me r\u00e9gion du Mali)\nCes femmes exercent essentiellement le commerce de condiments, de bijoux et de tissus.\nCe groupe est partenaire de Soro Yiriwaso depuis 3 ans.

With the money from her loan she will start a new business selling food supplies. The first items she plans to carry include rice, beans, cooking oil, and snack items like crackers and candy. More than anything, she wants to provide for her children so they can continue their education and fulfill their dreams. She also wishes to finish her own education, and talks excitedly about someday learning to use a computer, opening her own bank account, and using an ATM. <P>\r\n\r\nPlease support Miguelina and the

rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Entre los mitos al respecto, algunos dicen que es una derivaci\u00f3n de la originalmente dicha por un ingl\u00e9s \"Talca parece Londres\", por la abundante neblina que cubre frecuentemente la ciudad en la temporada invernal, a semejanza de la capital del Reino Unido.\n\n","en":"This communal bank is called \"Jireh\", and is made up of 20 entrepreneurs, who work in different trades, among which are found: clothing sales, lease of inflatable toys for children, construction teachers, center of depilation, artesans, lease of banquet articles, and service of floral arrangements, among others.  All of them belong to the city of Talca.  \r\n\r\nDomenica is the member of the communal Bank who in the photo is found in the first row, occupying the fourth place from right to left, shown in a purple sweater, gray pants and glasses.  She works in commerce, specifically selling used children's clothing.  Her sales are made from home during the week at any time of day, and on the weekends, she sets up a stall in an open market with her wares. She purchases her merchandise from distributors located in the city of Santiago.  She purchases the clothes by the bale which contain around 250 articles of clothing.  With the loan, she will buy bales of clothes and bags of used toys, since the Christmas season is approaching and it is a good season to sell these types of products.  Her goals are to expand her business and to include a greater variety of products.  Moreover, she would like to have a place established in some open market, that would offer her flexibility with her schedule and a certain amount of independence.  \r\n\r\nDomenica lives with her husband and their two children, ages 6 and 4.  She receives the support of her husband when he works, since he is primarily responsible for caring for the children.  Her husband is also a merchant and one of their dreams as a family is to become independent, to obtain better profits with their respective business.  Domenica is very happy for the loan and the services offered by Fondo Esperanza (Hope Fund), since the loan has allowed her to invest in her business and the trainings have served to help her learn about accounting, administration and strategies for how to manage her business.  \r\n\r\nWith respect to the group of the communal bank, she comments that they have had some differences to face; nevertheless, they have solved all without any problem, and that is what has brought the group together.  \r\n\r\nTalca belongs to the region of Maule, located in the central part of the country.  It constitutes the cultural, economic, and administrative center of the region, being the most important city of the Chilean Central Valley.  In Chile, a curious reference about Talca exists; the phrase \"Talca, Paris, and London\".  Among the myths on the matter, some they say that this is a derivation of the originally saying by an Englishman \"Talca seems like London\", due to the abundant fog that covers often the city in the winter season, resembling the capital of the United Kingdom.

She also likes the financial income that is generated by every crop that she is able to bring to sale.  On the flip-side, she comments that she doesn't much like when the weather's too hot, as she gets headaches and gets fatigued easily.  For this reason, she now has plans to mix up her business, and in her remaining space grow pasture and raise dairy cattle.  \r\n\r\nThis will be her third loan with the MPF institution, which is why she his hoping for your collaboration so that she can turn her plans into reality.

 Armando cultivates rice, watermelons, corn and soy beans on his land. He has been living in this area for about forty years. He lives with his wife and three of his sons who help him with the farming. He also lives with 4 grandchildren in his small home. He hopes to invest the loan in the preparation of his land for production and to purchase fertilizer. He is trying to save money in order to increase the size of his home for his family. \r\n<p>\r\n<h4>Communal Banking in Baba<\/h4> \r\n<p>This borrower is part of the newest and largest Communal Bank in the recently developed Mifex Rural Finance Program. All of the members of the Centro Agricola de Baba Communal Bank are part of an Association of Rice Farmers in the county of Baba in rural Ecuador. Their association works cooperatively to cultivate rice and commercialize the product after it has grown. As an association, Centro Agricola helps the farmers by providing access to machinery and training services. The farmers from Centro Agricola have received special instruction on financial responsibility and accounting from Codemicro, an organization that specializes in training programs geared towards the rural sector.  \r\n<\/p> \r\n<p>The members of Centro Agricola de Baba will use the micro-loans to prepare their land and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each others' guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the Centro Agricola de Baba Association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many micro-finance programs, but Mifex believes that is imperative for the communities we work with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties. <\/p> \r\n<p><em>Below is more information about Santa Lucia compiled by Luis Crespo and Robert Edgar of the Mifex team when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. <\/em><\/p> \r\n<h4>Economy of Baba<\/h4> \r\n<p>The people of Baba have been organized since the days of Gran Colombia when Ecuador was yet to be a country. The area has always been popular because of the extremely productive land that gave way to cultivation of cacao for decades. Now Baba is a county in the province of Los Rios in the coastal region of Ecuador. For most of the latter part of the 20th Century it was a cacao and banana producing sector. Most of the surrounding areas of Baba in Los Rios are owned by large mulitnational  \r\ncompanies such as Dole, but Baba is a sector characterized by the small and informal farms. <\/p>\r\n<p>Rice production has now turned into the main economic activity of the sector as about 80% of the people are rice farmers. Cacao is still very popular in the area, but because of the long cultivation cycle people prefer to invest in rice. The land in Baba is very fertile though, and most farmers in the sector often grow other crops, such as plantains and soy beans  \r\nas secondary sources of income.  Many farmers also keep livestock as emergency sources of food and income, commonly resorting to selling a chicken or pig if they are in need of cash. <\/p> \r\n<h4>Rice Farming in Baba<\/h4> \r\n<p>Most of the people in the Baba area are small farmers. They produce about 80 sacks of rice per hectare of land. In order to farm, they first must prepare the land by removing weed, plowing and leveling it. This is the most difficult part for the farmers in Baba, who often lack the necessary machinery to properly plow the land for rice production. After appropriately preparing the land, the farmers fill an area with water to form what is known as a paddy field, because rice is a very water intensive crop. The rice seeds are either dispersed freely (the process is known as boleo in Spanish) or hand sowed. Once the rice has grown, most farmers rent machinery that helps them gather their production. <\/p> \r\n<h4>Access to Credit<\/h4> \r\n<p>One of the biggest struggles in the area has been the lack of credit due to the absence of any type of financial institution. \r\nBecause people do not count on formal financial support, they have turned to loan sharks for financing. They have been affected by expensive lines of credit that exceed 100% interest a year and can be as expensive as 240%. Intermediaries also exploit the farmers because of their outstanding debt. Farmers also lack skills and knowledge to commercialize their products and pay fair prices for their crops. <\/p> \r\n<h4>Risks<\/h4> \r\n<p>The largest risk in the sector is due to absence of watering systems. Although Baba is in the province \u201cLos Rios\u201d (the rivers), there is severe problem with access to water. The lack of infrastructure in the sector does not allow the small farmers to benefit from the presence of the many rivers in the area. If the winter season is too dry, it is likely that the lands will not be sufficiently fertile for rice production in the summer. On the other hand, if there is too much rain there are not any drainage systems to prevent flooding and the crops are often ruined. Generally speaking though, Baba is a very productive sector where the lands yield all types of crops including rice, cacao, corn, watermelons, plantains, and soy beans. <\/p> \r\n<h4>Loan Use<\/h4> \r\n<p>The loans in this sector will mostly be used to to buy soil, seeds, fertilizer and insecticides. Many clients will use the capital towards renting machinery and equipment necessary to effectively work and prepare the fields. Clients also typically use a part of the loan to buy livestock in order to raise and have as reserves. The loan repayment schedule is different from the typical micro-entrepreneur because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures. Mifex asks our rural clients only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 6 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the seventh and final month. <\/p>\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":25823,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Prepare fields for rice cultivation","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Baba","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-1.783333 -79.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":7,"posted_date":"2007-04-10T18:01:41Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1200,"lender_count":32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Armando","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-04-28T22:39:39Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1200,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":200}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":200}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":200,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2007-06-08T09:15:27Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T22:03:40Z","rounded_local_amount":200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":21404},{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-07-13T19:31:32Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T22:03:40Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":31791},{"amount":1008,"local_amount":1008,"processed_date":"2008-01-03T21:33:57Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T22:03:40Z","rounded_local_amount":1008,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":107745}],"funded_date":"2007-04-14T22:39:39Z","paid_date":"2008-01-03T21:33:57Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":12149,"name":"Tofiq","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Z.

Before, she prepared and sold \u201cchicha,\u201d a popular Peruvian beverage made from maize and sugar. Sabina explains that this was a difficult way to turn over a significant profit, so like any smart businesswoman would do, she analyzed the market and decided to change gears and sell fruit. She is very happy with her decision, as she is currently making much more money and better able to support her young family. Additionally, Sabina has also found work as a nanny for two children in the area. This she alternates monthly with fruit sales.\r\n<p>\r\nIn the past year with her village bank, Sabina has learned how to save her money formally in the bank where it is safe and accumulates interest.

Maria M. travels two times a month to another district where she purchases goats from the breeders. She buys each goat for 250 MT and sells each for 600 or 700, depending on size. Thus, profit is approximately 350 MT per goat, not including transportation costs.\r\n<p>\r\nMaria\u2019s husband unfortunately is unemployed.

Ela ja iniciou o processo de montagem de uma instalacao electrica na sua residencia. Portanto esta e uma das mudancas positivas que estao acontecendo em sua vida.O emprestimo que ela recebeu ajudou-a muito. Ela conseguiu aumentar a quantidade de cabritos que tem comprado. A venda correu-lhe muito bem uma vez que concidiu com o periodo das festa do natal e do fim do ano. Portanto ela vendeu quase todos os cabritos que comprara. Maria M. viaja 2 vezes por mes para um outro distrito onde compra os cabritos aos criadores para a revenda. cada cabrito ela tem comprado por 250,00 Mt e ela revend-\/o por 600, 700 consoante o tamanho. Portanto o lucro e de aproximadamente 350 Mt por cabrito deduzindo-se o valor do transporte. O marido de Maria infelizmente nao esta empregado. Ela faz pequenos expedientes e trabalha na machamba familiar para o sustento de sua familia. Mqaria esta muito satisfeita com o emprestimo anterior recebido. Ela tinha pedido por 3 meses e agora ela quer pedir um novo . O primeiro ela consguiu fechar sem problemas nenhuns.

The competition level is high but the partners know how to get ahead selling their products, but are in need of economic support for the low periods when they have to change the products or increase the merchandise, and for this reason they require financing. In spite of the group being new, it has experience from solidary groups due to prior loans from institutions similar to Fundaci\u00f3n Agrocapital who offers them support to extend their businesses

He is 24 years old, married, and has one school-aged child. To make a living, Roland plants and harvests rice to sell. He has been engaged in his business for over three years and earns approximately $1080 during harvest season.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Roland joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Roland has successfully repaid a previous loan of 26,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase fertilizers such as manure. Roland is requesting a new loan of 30,000 PHP which again will be used to purchase fertilizers. This will be his fourth loan from ASKI.

He is 38 years old. Roger is the group leader of a 7-member group loan offered by ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nRoger is married and has 4 school-aged children. To make a living, Roger owns & operates a business venture in the retail sector running a general store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling both food & daily use products in the local community. Roger has been engaged in his business for over 4 years and earns approximately 5000 PHP monthly for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Roger joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Roger has successfully repaid a previous loan of 9000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Roger is requesting a new loan of 12000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional inventory & working capital. This loan will be the 6th loan taken out by Roger from ASKI. He plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand the business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 38 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

She is married to Jose P., an overseas Filipino worker. She is the mother of five children, one of whom is already working while another is currently enrolled in college; one is in high school and two are enrolled in the local elementary school. \r\n\r\nBy the grace of God, Susan has managed to support her older children's schooling up to the college level. At this time, she is working hard to be able to send her remaining children all the way through college. This is a dream for most Filipino parents like Susan, as she herself has been a college undergraduate and believes that a college diploma is the best inheritance parents can leave to their children.\r\n\r\nSusan operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store that retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, 5 PHP\u2019s-worth of cooking oil or an egg. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She makes a profit by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling them at retail piece rates. She earns a minimum of 200 PHP in sales every day.\r\n\r\n\r\nSusan is requesting a 17,000 PHP loan to buy more products like groceries, toiletries and beverages so as to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. Susan dreams of being able to give all of her children a good and high-quality education through all of her hard work in her business.\r\n\r\n\r\nSusan prays for successful lives for all her children and hopefully they will able to send her children all the way through college.  As a CCT community partner, she faithfully attends the group's weekly fellowship* meeting where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she received.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community members are organized into fellowship groups composed of 15 to 30 community partners that meet on a weekly basis. The fellowship groups gather to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance loans.

To make enough money, he goes to visit his customers from district to district because he does not have the money to establish a photo studio. Very dynamic and devoted, he has quickly gained the trust of his customers and is in high demand, especially for big events. At the request of many of his customers, he would like to open his own studio. This project requires the capital that Mr. S.'s small income would not be able to support. He would therefore like to ask for a credit of $700 to open his own studio, buy a high-quality camera as well as a video camera for event reporting. This credit will allow him to bring his work to a more professional level and, ultimately, earn a better income.\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from French by Ivana Kostic, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nN\u00e9 le 22 Septembre 1983, Monsieur S.

He has had his store right in the middle of the city for two years now.  The business is attended to personally by Felipe, and of course, with the constant help of his two daughters.  Since his business is getting better every day, Felipe's current project is to finance a hamburger restaurant to be able to attract more clients and to have a larger income. <p>\r\nFelipe is a very hard-working and sacrificing person, since he had to raise his two daughters by himself.

Each day Sayu works hard to help her husband add to their family earnings. Her husband Putu Suatra works as a contract farmer, and so his job is not stable. Through their Tempek group (a traditional organization) in their village, Sayu Kadek Lastri has received a loan from Yayasan Dinari (Kiva partner organization coordinating this listing). With these funds she has purchased female cows with the hope that in the future she will get the cows to birth calves. In addition, the funds were used to buy three pigs. After raising them for three months, the plan is to sell two and keep one for breeding. Each day Sayu Kadek Lastri tends to and cares for her cows and pigs.The calf would only need to be fed grass and tender green leaves that are readily available in Sayu\u2019s garden. For her pigs, Sayu has to buy bran grains and feed mixture. The hope is that within three months the pigs are ready for sale with an estimated price of Rp.1,800,000 (USD equivalent $196) for two. The net gain in those three months could reach Rp.500,000 (USD equivalent 54), and she could use that income to fulfill her family\u2019s needs. Her hope for the future is that her efforts with the cows and pigs will pay off for the family. \r\n\r\n   <p><b>Translated from Bahasa Indonesia by Aarati, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nSayu Kadek Lastri adalah seroang ibu rumah tangga  yang ulet dan tidak pernah tinggal diam saja.

Setiap hari Sayu Kadek Lastri memelihara dan merawat sapi dan 3 ekor babinya. Anak sapi hanya diberi makan rumput dan daun hijau yang mudah didapat di kebunnya. Untuk babinya Sayu Kadek Lastri harus membeli dedak padi dan konsentrat sebagai campurannya dengan harapan dalam 3 bulan babi siap dijual dengan perkiraan harga Rp.1.800.000,-.untuk dua ekor.

Hikmatullo lives in Shahrituz, Tajikistan where he was born in 1958. With God's help, he has become an excellent supplier of vegetables for his community. He is responsible for seven people (his wife and six children) and earns his family's living with his farming. Hikmatullo knows all the ins and outs of this business. He has 13 years of experience. His greatest triumph is his production of vegetables in the off-season. However, in order to accomplish this, he needs to purchase seeds and mineral fertilizer. For this reason, he is requesting a loan of $3,000 USD to be able to supply enough vegetables to meet the demand. This will allow him to better provide for his family. Let's help Hikmatullo as he works hard to improve the quality of life for his family.   \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Pine Tree, Brgy. Bulanon, Sagay City, Negros Occidental, earns her living by operating two business ventures:  a general store and a fishing business. Her husband, 42-year-old Rogelio E. Jr., works as a fishermen and assists in his wife's business activities. They have four children ranging from 11 to 22 years old. <p>\r\n\r\nMyrna joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1997 because she aspired to something better for her family. With the help of her past 15 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Myrna has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 22000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 10000, uplifting the family's standard of living.  <p>\r\n\r\nThis time, for her 16th loan, she is borrowing PHP 24000 to buy additional supplies for her sari-sari (general) store as well as materials to make some repairs to her house. Myrna E. is a Dungganon woman, following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. <p>\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

Kholoud's husband bought a store four years ago, paying the down payment from his savings and the rest from the store's returns. Now that he has one last payment to pay, he came to FATEN and took a loan for this purpose.\n\nOwning the store converts the amount he used to pay in rent to returns and improves his financial situation. The store, which sells books, stationary, toys and other things, is located in a good area surrounded by schools.\n\nKholoud comes from a conservative background, so her husband Haitham appears in the picture here in the store.\n\nAbout Shariah-compliant lending:\n \nFATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

Valencia, Alegria, Cebu. She earns her living by operating two businesses: a general store and video rental. She has three children who are between 30 and 38 years old. \r\n\r\nRomula joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2007 because she hoped for something better for her family. With the help of her past six loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Romula has been lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 14,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 8,000, thus improving the family's standard of living. \r\n\r\nThis time, for her seventh loan, she hopes to borrow PHP 15,000 to purchase more stock to sell. Romula L. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

","en":"Rosa, 34, lives with her spouse and six-year-old son to the south of the city, where she works selling movies.  Also, for two years she has been offering a service from her own apartment renting washing machines to neighbors in her neighborhood and nearby.  With a frequency of daily sales and installments, she gets a profit margin of no less than 50%.\r\n\r\nShe started her enterprising idea when she bought her first DVD player.  With her friends and neighbors and a television set they would get together in her house and rent movies to watch.  This is how she asked her husband to put up the announcement of renting and selling movies, which has gone very well for her.  Later she added to her domestic clientele the service of renting washing machines, which she had known about through her mother's experience.  Her two businesses have allowed her to generate income, with which she has supported the well-being of her home.\r\n\r\nCurrently she is applying for a Kiva loan, the first funding she has requested from the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  With the loan she will buy two more washing machines, with which she will expand her potential for accessing the market and she will respond to her customers' demand, which often goes away unmet because her machines are busy in various areas of the neighborhood.\r\n\r\nRosa has described herself as a person who likes to save.  This is why it was not difficult for her to get her first working capital and make her first investment in the entrepreneurship of her small business.\r\n\r\nToday she feels very satisfied and wants to continue the growth of her business.

of Red October, and grew up in a large family of ordinary workers. After finishing school, she helped her family on the farm, as there could be no talk of further education at that time. The main source of income for the family was growing of rice, work with livestock and field crop cultivation. \r\n\r\nMarrying a fellow villager, the young family was working in the field, growing rice as well. 28 years old went by, and the family went through many difficulties. It became harder and harder to live in the native village, the land was not enough for everyone, and Ashirgul and her husband were by this time raising eight children. \r\n\r\nIn 2000, the family decided to move to the Chuy valley (northern part). From their accumulated funds, the family bought a small house. The four sons helped the father with farming. Ashirgul grew vegetables on a plot of land, and sold the harvest at the market. Thanks to the income from the field crop cultivation, the family was able to buy a cow at the end of 2000. At present, Ashirgul and her family work 8.5 hectares of rented land, where they grow onions and other vegetables, and the farm has two dairy cows. \r\n\r\nWith an aim to further expand her business, Ashirgul turned to the organization \"Bai Tushum & Partners\" for a loan in the amount of 80,000 som (KGS) for the purchase of fertilizers, because this raw material is cheaper in winter, and in the plating season the price rises sharply. In the future Ashirgul dreams of opening her own mini-farm."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1725,"image":{"id":984739,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase fertilizers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Alekseevka village","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2012-01-17T21:00:13Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1725,"lender_count":57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ashirgul","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-12-23T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":80000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2012-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":40000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":862.5},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":862.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":862.5,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T09:13:21Z","rounded_local_amount":40387.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308095420},{"amount":862.5,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T11:44:25Z","rounded_local_amount":40387.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315329658}],"funded_date":"2012-01-18T03:17:08Z","paid_date":"2012-11-15T11:44:25Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Audhild Randa","image":132928}},{"id":394145,"name":"Gloria","description":{"languages":["es"],"texts":{"es":"Gloria es una persona que ha tenido que atravesar por muchas adversidades en su vida, sin embargo, sus ganas de trabajar le han permitido salir adelante y progresar junto a su familia.

What she sets out for she gets. She is so humble and honest and a very hardworking woman on this planet Earth. Ruth is the mother of two lovely children that she really adores so much.\n\nRuth hails from the Sanga, Kericho area of Kenya. Ruth started farming and has been doing farming for the past five years. Through those years she has gathered so much experience and all the farming techniques are at her fingertips. \n\nRuth practices mixed farming on her farm and, through the profits, she has managed to take care of her family's needs and also give her  two children a good education.\n\nRuth is a woman who is very enterprising and she is seeking a loan of KES 20,000 to buy seeds and start horticulture farming on her farm. Because of favorable weather patterns, a good road network in her village, good soil and a ready market for horticulture products, Ruth wants to take advantage of that and reap more profits.

She prepared the spices in her mother's house, and then they took a little table outside the door of their house and the exposed their product in plastic bags, selling also in the sidewalks of the Central de Le\u00f3n market. <p> With time she began to elaborate other products and she took advantag the clients she had in order to sell national products made by hand like 'jicaras,' 'comales,' wooden spoons, piggybanks, etc. All these objects would be exposed in some sweaters on the floor just by the little table. Her first credit was 3 years ago and she invested it to complete the money and to buy her space within the market we mentioned, and with this she began to produce. \r\n<p>\r\nShe comments that before she worked in this business she worked as a maid, cleaning and ironing clothes in domicile. When she changed jobs, however, all her family saw how profitable this business was and how much support she got from this organization who has given her the credits.

Ellas preparaban en su casa los encurtidos, luego sacaban a la puerta de su casa una mesita de madera y exponian su producto en bolsas de pl\u00e1stico, tambien vendian en las aceras del mercado Central de Le\u00f3n. <p>Con el tiempo empezaba a elaborar otros productos y aprovechaba la clientela que tenia para vender productos nacionales hechos a mano como J\u00cdCARAS, COMALES, CUCHARAS DE MADERA, ALCANCIAS DE BARRO etc. Todo eso lo extend\u00eda en unos sacos en el suelo a lado de su mesita.

All the members of the group will use the loan for different purposes. Mrs. Sarorn L. is a tobacco seller. Aside from this business, she is a farmer who owns a plot of land on which she cultivates rice. In her plantation, she faces an obstacle which is that her field is infertile, and this badly affects her crop. In order to deal with this problem, she decided to ask for a loan to buy fertilizer. She intends to use the rest of her loan to buy gasoline to pump water to irrigate the field, which will make her crop more productive. Her husband, Mr. Long Pang, is a construction worker. Mrs. Sarorn L. is 52 years old and the mother of six children, one of whom is a cow breeder, another three of whom are laborers, and the rest are attending the local

To generate income everyday, she also offers manicure and pedicure services to everyone in the village who is interested in paying her service fee of PHP40\/person only.

Through this loan she plans to start up her own hog (pig raising) business. The profits she will earn from selling the hogs after four months of fattening would augment her husband\u2019s income as a farmer. As the business grows, she would be able to support more of her children and grandchildren\u2019s needs.  By then, her role being a mother would be completed.

Occidental. She is 48 years old, and married to Roberto M. who works as a laborer in the Ceres bus terminal. They have 3 children who are between 5 and 19 years old. Tessie has accepted the reality that her husband\u2019s income is just too small to sustain their family's growing needs. This is why she explored ways to help her husband by earning on her own, because she also dreamed that her children would be able to finish their college education, have gainful work and live a more comfortable life.<p>\r\n\r\nIt was quite providential that a friend invited her to join NWTF-Project Dungganon, and with her husband's consent, she became a member in 1997 and she used her loans to start a general store. The business turned out to be a good investment for it had an immediate impact by lightening the burden of the household expenses from her husband's shoulders. When a new opportunity arose to buy and sell scrap materials (old metals, plastic, bottles, etc.), she jumped at the chance and it improved her business income even further. Now her business earns an average net income of PHP 2,400 per month.<p>\r\n\r\nIn her previous loan, she borrowed the amount of PHP 12,000, which she used as additional working capital for her general store and scrap business. The loan was fully paid on time, maintaining her standing as a good member. Now she is borrowing for her 12th cycle loan the same amount of PHP 12,000 to be used as additional capital for her businesses. She plans to use the income from this venture for house repairs and as a start-up capital for a new business which she is presently exploring.<p>\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress out of earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":423526,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

Con el dinero que solicita, tiene planeado comprar decenas de prendas de vestir y calzados, porque la mercader\u00eda que adquirir\u00e1 pr\u00e1cticamente ya est\u00e1 vendida porque son s\u00f3lo pedidos.   ","en":"Sibia is 29 years old and lives at home with her parents Nicolas (age 64) and Adelaida (age 53), her two siblings Elmer (age 22) and Yosmi (age 11), and her three year old daughter.\r\n<p>\r\nFor the past nine years, Sibia has been selling apparel, shoes, and beauty products.   Her youngest sibling looks after her daughter while she is at her job working for a public company.  Sibia always keeps a photograph of her daughter with her to look at whenever she feels that she does not have the strength to continue.  Her daughter motivates her to continue fighting and forget about her past struggles.  She says that after separating from her husband, she learned how to value herself more as a woman, become independent, and live without fear.  Sibia has been able to succeed because her business is profitable enough for her to cover her family\u2019s expenses and set aside some savings.  In the future, she wants to expand her business, acquire more apparel to add to her inventory, and purchase display cabinets for showing off outfits.  She thinks this will be a good marketing strategy.\r\n<p>\r\nSibia fearlessly assumes her role as both mother and daughter so that her daughter does not feel like a part of her is missing.  She is grateful to MFP because she and the other members of her Communal Bank have grown financially as a group.  Sibia enjoys working with them because they understand her because they struggle just like she does.  She is requesting her fifth loan from the Institution.  With the money she will receive, Sibia plans to buy clothing and shoes by the dozen because her existing merchandise is already sold and she has outstanding orders.\r\n <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":469013,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"Purchase more merchandise","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Chanchamayo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.05 -75.316667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-01-15T04:20:14Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":525,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sibia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-12-18T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2010-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2010-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2010-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2010-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2010-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2010-01-17T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:10:27Z","rounded_local_amount":253.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118124438},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2010-02-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:49:02Z","rounded_local_amount":253.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123960179},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2010-03-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:32:59Z","rounded_local_amount":253.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128993023},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2010-04-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:37:31Z","rounded_local_amount":253.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136717809},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2010-05-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:39:31Z","rounded_local_amount":253.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144751484},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2010-06-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:02:41Z","rounded_local_amount":253.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151933951}],"funded_date":"2010-01-15T14:34:49Z","paid_date":"2010-07-15T10:02:41Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ronan Reodica","image":498323}},{"id":172273,"name":"Mrs. Roem Chhieng Village Bank Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Roem C. is 47 years old, and the mother of three children who are students at the local school.

the Russian Federation but, however promising employment opportunities in other countries might be, this journey in search of a job is an extremely risky undertaking and requires one to be very brave and careful. \r\n\r\nYrysbu U. is the leader of this group. She has raised four children. Her eldest daughter is 35. When she realized that her own country had little to offer in her youth, she decided to try her chances in Russia. Now she is working in Russia as a saleswoman. Yrysbu\u2019s middle son, who is 30, also made up his mind to work in Russia. He is working in a clothing factory. Her second son, 27, works as a security guard in the biggest Kyrgyzstan market. Her younger daughter got married and now she is a housewife. As for Yrysbu\u2019s husband, he is an actor. He works in the Naryn theater. Yrysbu raises cattle. Her son and daughter help her look after the cattle, so this activity does not present significant difficulties for Yrysbu. Eight years ago, Yrysbu bought a cow and since then has been striving to increase her cattle population. Yrysbu needs a loan to purchase sheep. She plans to save her earnings to help her grandchildren in the future. Her dream is to buy each grandchild a flat and a car. \r\n\r\n<u>Yrysbu\u2019s partners:<\/u>\r\nGulnara A., 45, is the mother of three sons. Gulnara combines two jobs. Apart from a regular job, she also breeds cattle. Gulnara hopes to obtain this loan and buy three sheep.\r\n\r\nJidekul T., 62, is retired. She keeps cows and sells milk. Jidekul needs this loan to buy one more cow to increase her income. \r\n\r\nJypargul O., 33, has a son. She works in a small factory producing sausages. Jypargul hopes to obtain this loan to buy a calf, feed it and sell it. She will use the money earned to prepare her children for school. \r\n\r\nAimkan A., 37, has two children. She works as an accountant and also raises cattle. Aimkan sells milk and thus has an extra source of income. Aimkan has applied for this loan to buy a calf for feeding. \r\n\r\n======================================\r\n\r\n<b>Where Did This Loan Come From?<\/b>\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance, a young and ambitious socially-focused MFI in Kyrgyzstan.\r\n\r\nMol Bulak Finance is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development on the basis of 3-Ps concept \u2013 <b>P<\/b>eople (building human capital and taking care of its customers and the society as well), <b>P<\/b>rofit (to be profitable to grow further) and the <b>P<\/b>lanet (taking care of the environment).
