Samson has been selected to act as the Kiva group representative and is standing on the right with his hand raised.  He and the other farmers represented in this group are each receiving seeds and fertilizer for \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of sorghum or millet.  Each farmer is receiving an average input loan of 5,349 shillings for maize, millet and sorghum cultivation.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nSamson is a reliable member of the community.  He is married with six children. Samson is 40 years old and has been working as a farmer for the last 21 years to support his family.  In addition to this, Samson is very active in his community and is involved in the men's group and the savings group.  He described his harvest last year as good.

He first joined One Acre Fund in 2012 and has continued working with One Acre Fund in order to get the best seed prices, fertilizer and hybrid seeds. As an active member in his community, Samson also chose to be a group leader and Kiva representative because he wants to help more farmers.  Samson plans to use the future profits from the harvest to send his children to school, and save for the future.  His life has improved by working with One Acre Fund because he has more farm training and has more farm group support.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nSamson and his group need a loan to cover the initial costs of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer through One Acre Fund.  One Acre Fund will repay the Kiva loan on behalf of the farmers through the profits from the farmers\u2019 harvests.  One Acre Fund pre-purchases the seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings to the farmers.  Throughout the planting and harvesting season, One Acre Fund also provides training and support to the farmers as they make payments back to One Acre Fund.  With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits and improved lives.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nThe field officer is also included in the photo and is standing on the left in the photo.\t\r\n"}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1547702,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To gain access to cost efficient hybrid seeds for maize, millet, and sorghum.\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Lugari","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":3900,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Samson","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Edward","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Geoffrey","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lennedy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Janapher","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Beatrice","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":336987,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":3900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":336987}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":3900}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":882165,"name":"Jean Bosco","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jean Bosco aged 36 years.

Occidental. She has been a member of Everlasting Center for eight years.  During this time, she has borrowed money from Paglaum Multi Purpose Cooperative. Emma manages a fishing business. She has requested a loan of PHP 25,000 to purchase additional fishing nets and to buy a pumpboat.  Recently, the couple has been running two pumpboats and they can earn about PHP 700 daily.  Aside from having a fishing business, they also have a piggery to provide additional income. Mrs. P. says it is good to have dual businesses but you have to make sure that you handle them with much care. The success of her business lies in your hands, she added. \r\n\r\nMrs. P.'s hopes are 1) to provide her children with a good education, 2) that the piggery will succeed, and 3) that their fishing business will flourish.\r\n

She is 55 years old and a resident of Kompong Tom province, located about 200 km from the capital, Phnom Penh. She has two children: one is married and one is single. \r\n<p>\r\nSo O. saves up over 10 sets of rattan and then sells them to her customers for profit.

He has been in the business for 19 years. He started his business with his own empty bags and a little capital he had and it started to grow. His business is the sale of empty bags and plastic containers. These are very useful since most people use them to store corn, rice, beans and other products. He really enjoys his work.

Medy has been engaged in her business for over 5 years and earns approximately 4,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Medy joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. Medy has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Medy is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the 2nd loan taken out by Medy from ASKI.

She is married and has one son and one daughter; her husband is a carpenter with low income. Haneen wants to help her husband in purchasing new carpentry tools, but the amount of money she has isn't enough to pay, so she needs to take a loan from FATEN. When Haneen gets the FATEN loan, which is to be repaid on a monthly basis, she will be able to help her husband to purchase new carpentry tools so he can improve his work positively and provide better life conditions for the family. Haneen is a conservative woman, so her husband is photographed instead.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout this loan product:\r\nFATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan. For more information on lending in the Muslim world, please visit Kiva's Muslim World Lending helptext: http:\/\/tinyurl.com\/3aekx8m.\r\n

aged 52 years. He is married with 4 children aged between 8 and 117 years. They go to school. He is a farmer and he has been growing maize for the past 30 years. Also his wife is a farmer. With the loan from Kiva, he would like to buy more fertilizers of maize and pay workers. The profits from the business will be used to pay school fees of his children and to improve his savings.\n\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations.

Each member plans to use the loan for a different purpose. \r\n\r\nMrs. S. Y., the village bank president, owns a small store where she sells rice soup to villagers and passers-by. Her business is going well and she wants to expand it, so she has decided to ask for a loan to buy more rice and other ingredients used to cook delicious rice soup for her customers. \r\n\r\nHer husband, Mr. Phin Veoun, has a plot of land where he cultivates rice for a living. Mrs. S. Y. is 43 years old and the mother of four children, two of whom are employed in a garment factory. The others are attending the local school. \r\n\r\nOne of the members of this village loan group has an end-of-term loan. The rest have monthly payment loans. The member with the end-of-term loan is not required to pay any principal on the loan until the very end of the loan term. \r\n\r\nEnd-of-term (EoT) loans are AMK's main product because they are the most beneficial to Cambodia's poor. The terms allow them to repay portions of the principal whenever they are financially able. Most clients start to make payments many months before the end of the loan term. Almost all of AMK's clients make their payments on time. AMK has a delinquency rate of only 0.09% and AMK has a default rate of 0% on

He is a man who, from an early age, was characterized as a hard worker who was very dedicated to his agricultural work, raising cattle. He saw this as an activity that would enable him to have additional income due to the high demand for these animals in the markets. His challenge is to improve the breed, but to do so he would have feed them properly. Kurbon has the best intentions for his children, which allows him to continue improving as a father and farmer. This farmer yearns to expand his business so that he will be able to improve his family living. In order to do so he is asking for a loan that will allow him to buy animals of a better breed to improve their quality.  \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and its famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, such as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the Fourth millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition.

The children are currently going to school and help their parents in the business as part of their daily chores.\r\n\r\nMarlyn joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2005 in the hope that she would be able to help her husband improve the quality of life of their family. With the help of her loans from NWTF-PD, she has been able to increase their family's income by engaging in selling footwear at retail and running a cafeteria business. Now she earns an average monthly income of PHP 3,000 from her business activities.\r\n\r\nMarlyn is a member in good standing. Her previous loan of PHP 19,000 was used to fund operation of her retail footwear business, and it had a positive impact on both the business and the family\u2019s living conditions. Now she is borrowing PHP 19,000 for her 12th loan, which she intends to use as additional capital for her footwear and cafeteria businesses. Marlyn is working hard to achieve her dreams and aspirations for her family, which are to provide them with a brighter future and a more comfortable life.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress out of earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":490834,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Shoe

This is what one person did to overcome life's adversities. Lolita D. S., 63, reached only elementary school, but is now working hard on making her business grow. Being a Community Partner in CCT*, she applies to her business what she learns from her entrepreneurial training and Bible fellowships. She presently lives in Baseco, Manila, with Noviros, her husband who is also a sari-sari (variety) store vendor. \r\n\r\nLolita co-manages the sari-sari store with Noviros. It is a residential business which has been in operation for fifteen years now. Their family mainly runs the store, catering to the immediate needs of their community, such as rice, milk in sachets, and instant food sold in pouches. Monthly they earn an average income of Php 10,500.\r\n\r\nTo further help her grow her business, Lolita decided to borrow Php 24,000. She wants to add more groceries to her store and also start selling beverages amd retailing charcoal which is widely used as household fuel in her community. A big part of the loan will go to these purchases, while Lolita intends to use part of the money for the improvement of their house. \r\n\r\nLife is as hard as a rock, but with the wisdom Lolita has gained through her experience, she claims that life can be smooth sailing for her.

The capital from her loan will enable her to buy larger quantities of kerosene from the oil companies, which gives her a reduced price per liter.

Wema is a twenty-nine-year-old woman from Dar es Salaam. As she is divorced, she is solely responsible for supporting her nine-year-old son, Ally. She is a new entrepreneur who established a business selling traditional African cloth called batik only six months ago. Tanzanian women buy her cloth to wear as vitenge, which is the traditional outfit worn by local women. <P>Kitenge (the Swahili plural is vitenge) is a cotton fabric with wax print, printed by using rotary printing machines. Most often, it is a multicolored, dark wax print on a lighter background. Kitenge is also a communicating textile - the various colors, patterns, writings and symbols represent moods, feelings, cultures, and traditions of native African people. <P>Wema currently earns about US$ 60 per month from the sale of her cloth. She is requesting a loan of US$ 275 to purchase for her store additional stocks of cloth in bulk, which she will then retail for a profit. She is hopeful that this loan will enable her to increase the quantity and stock of her business.\r\n\r\n<P>SELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility as a practical way to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women. <P>Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions as they lack tangible collateral assets. This leads to poor financial support hence the poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. <P>When a client needs working capital to buy a specific item, SELFINA buys the equipment for said client and extends a loan to her. The same equipment is then leased back to the client so they can use it while in process of paying back their loan \u2013 a process called a sale and leaseback arrangement. Once the loan has been repaid, SELFINA transfers the ownership of the equipment to the client. <P>The advantage of microleasing over traditional microfinance loans is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":191769,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"To purchase supplies of cloth in bulk for her store","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Dar es Salaam","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-6.8 39.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-08-29T18:50:27Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":275,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Wema","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-09-12T19:42:29Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":300000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":60000},{"due_date":"2008-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":60000},{"due_date":"2008-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":60000},{"due_date":"2009-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":60000},{"due_date":"2009-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":60000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":55}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":55,"local_amount":60000,"processed_date":"2008-10-11T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-20T07:18:43Z","rounded_local_amount":63965,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356186},{"amount":55,"local_amount":60000,"processed_date":"2008-11-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T04:18:26Z","rounded_local_amount":63965,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5347928},{"amount":55,"local_amount":60000,"processed_date":"2008-12-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:08:48Z","rounded_local_amount":63965,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9970502},{"amount":55,"local_amount":60000,"processed_date":"2009-01-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:13:08Z","rounded_local_amount":63965,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14886719},{"amount":55,"local_amount":60000,"processed_date":"2009-02-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:02:20Z","rounded_local_amount":63965,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20435979}],"funded_date":"2008-08-29T19:42:29Z","paid_date":"2009-03-16T21:02:20Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":65100,"name":"Juana Maria","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La Se\u00f1ora Juana Maria M. tiene 39 a\u00f1os de edad, habita en el Barrio Villa Reconciliaci\u00f3n del distrito seis de Managua, su compa\u00f1ero de vida trabaja como conductor y ayuda para las necesidades del hogar, tiene 2 hijas en edad escolar, (a esta se\u00f1ora en el cr\u00e9dito anterior de Kiva, se le falleci\u00f3 uno de sus hijos) \r\nDo\u00f1a Juana Maria tiene una pulper\u00eda en su casa de habitaci\u00f3n, donde ofrece productos b\u00e1sicos para el hogar, su mayor clientela la tiene en todo su entorno, inicio su negocio hace quince a\u00f1os con capital propio  e inventario muy poco, su mayor anhelo es ver crecer su negocio para una mejor atenci\u00f3n a sus clientes, es por eso que solicita este pr\u00e9stamo para invertir en la compra de productos de consumo b\u00e1sico y poder ampliar la diversidad de su oferta.","en":"Se\u00f1ora Juana Maria M. is 39 years old and lives in the Villa Reconiliaci\u00f3n neighborhood of the 6th district of Managua.

Rosalyn has been engaged in her business for over 20 years and earns approximately 15,000.00 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Rosalyn joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services. She hoped to help improve her living situation and increase her ability to engage in business activities. Rosalyn has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000.00 PHP from GDMPC. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional fish to sell. Rosalyn is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP, which will be used as additional capital for her business. This loan will be the second loan taken out by Rosalyn from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three units offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte, and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolk, and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":516961,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To use as additional capital for her fishing business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Tabo-o,Jimenez,Misamis Occidental","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":136,"posted_date":"2010-04-15T03:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":225,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosalyn","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2010-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2010-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2010-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2010-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2010-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":1666.67,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:02:04Z","rounded_local_amount":1675.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136683579},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":1666.67,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:24:20Z","rounded_local_amount":1675.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144717567},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":1666.67,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:51:04Z","rounded_local_amount":1675.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151900739},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":1666.67,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:18:22Z","rounded_local_amount":1675.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159640753},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":1666.67,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:22:20Z","rounded_local_amount":1675.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166854857},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":1666.65,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:11:59Z","rounded_local_amount":1675.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172121580}],"funded_date":"2010-04-17T12:29:46Z","paid_date":"2010-10-15T10:11:59Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Maeve","image":1271729}},{"id":197061,"name":"Suzanne","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"N\u00e9e en 1980 \u00e0 Cotonou, capitale \u00e9conomique du B\u00e9nin, B.

Her husband, Bernardo L., who is 50 years old, works as a tricycle driver to earn his living, and also helps in his wife's businesses. They have four children aged between 15 and 26. \r\n<br>Nida joined Kiva partner, NWTF-Project Dungganon, in 2000 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past ten loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Nida has been gradually lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 22,000 PHP helped her earn a monthly profit of 3,000 PHP, raising the family's standard of living. This time, for her 11th loan, she is borrowing 29,000 PHP, which she intends to use to purchase feed and other supplies for her piggery. In this way, she hopes to continue to save up for the future and to sustain their daily needs and give their children a good education. \r\n<br>Nida L. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \t\r\n<p>\r\n<b>About NWTF<\/b><br>\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means 'honorable').

She lives in her own house with her 32-year old husband Alfredo and their four beloved children for whom she wishes to provide a better quality of life.\r\n\r\nRebeca and her husband have succeeded in making their land fertile and surrounded by lush trees. This is where she grows cocoa and coffee, work she's been doing for ten years. She also gets help from time to time from labourers who work on contract. Ever since she was little, Rebeca learnt about the land from her parents.Her most profitable crop is coffee as she sells it in large quantities and for a good price. With the money she earns, she has managed to buy many useful items for the home. \r\n\r\nThe season she likes the least is winter because of the number of insects and the large amount of rain. This is why she has approached the institution Financiera for a loan to try to overcome the insect infestations and safeguard the blossoms on the crops. \r\n\r\nRebeca's plan for the future is to continue farming and acquire more land so that she can overcome the poverty in which her family lives. She does not want to cause any problems for the financial institution or for the members of her community bank. She is grateful to the donors for their help with her work.

She lives with her spouse and three children who are 7, 5 and 2 years old in their own house.  Nadia\u2019s work consists in selling food.  She goes to the market very early to buy the ingredients to prepare the food because in the afternoon she goes out into the street in front of her house to start selling her delicious and well prepared Juanes [made with rice, pieces of poultry meat, eggs, olives, aromatic herbs and spices, all wrapped up in \"bijao\" (plant from the jungle) leaves and boiled in clay pots], Tacachos [hash-like dish of plantain and pork or chicken] and roasted pork and chicken.  She\u2019s been in this business for two years and works alone since her children are still too young and her spouse returns late from work.  What she likes about her work is that it leaves her with time to tend to her household, that is, she can care for her children since they are at a stage where they need much attention.  She is doing well in her work because she sells quite a bit every day and she hopes to stay in business and gradually equip it.\r\n\r\nThis will be her first MFP loan.

She is happily married and, together with her handsome husband, is blessed with eight adorable children. Despite her considerable age for the past 30 years, she has been involved in mixed farming, and because of the immense knowledge she has on farming, farmers come to seek advice from her. Margaret is the breadwinner of her family, and this really pushes her to work hard so that her children will have a bright future and her parents will have a comfortable life.\n\nAlthough she makes a profit from farming, she is not comfortable and has always wanted to increase her income by selling cereals. That is why she is seeking this loan to buy cereals. Kenya's Kitale area, one of the country's populated regions, has a high demand for cereals. This means that Margaret could increase her profits and satisfy the demand that is there. \n\nAccessing funds has been a challenge for Margaret, but she now feels relieved, because Juhudi Kilimo is partnering with Kiva lenders to help aspiring women farmers like her turn their farming dreams into reality through training and loan financing. Margaret believes that this loan will be of much help, and that she will be able to satisfy the demand for cereals. She also believes that the extra income she earns will enable permanent change in her life and increase her business. Increased profits will allow Margaret to repay this loan and secure the future of her school-going children.She dreams of building a modern house and moving from the mud house where she currently stays in.\n"}},"status":"inactive","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":2049322,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy cereals","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kitale","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1.016667 35","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Margaret","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-12-14T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":40000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":2830.92},{"due_date":"2016-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":2913.65},{"due_date":"2016-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":2998.8},{"due_date":"2016-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":3086.44},{"due_date":"2016-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":3176.65},{"due_date":"2016-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":3269.48},{"due_date":"2016-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":3365.03},{"due_date":"2016-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":3463.38},{"due_date":"2016-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":3564.59},{"due_date":"2016-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":3668.77},{"due_date":"2016-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":3775.99},{"due_date":"2016-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":3886.3}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.31},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.14},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.99},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.86},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.77},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.69},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.65},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.63},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.65},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.69},{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.76},{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.86}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":3665,"name":"Dorothy","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Dorothy is 45 years and a mother of 2.

Samuel","description":{"languages":["pt"],"texts":{"pt":"Sabado is 39 years old and she is from the province of Gaza. Sabado has 7 children with two different wives -- 5 of them are from the same mother and their ages range from 8 to 18 years old. His children from the second wife are 13 and 16 years old. Out of the 7 children, only the oldest one does not go to school anymore. Besides his children, Sabado also supports his mother who lives in Chokwe by sending her a monthly allowance. \r\nSabado went to school until the 4th grade and he says he did not continue his education because he traveled during his vacation to another province and once he returned his spot in the school was not available any longer. In 1980, right after his father death, he moved away from the province of Gaza and relocated to Maputo to look for a better life. In 1981 he worked for Vetagro-Boane and between 1995 and 1997 he worked as a security guard when there were many lay-offs and he was also let go. In 1998 he tried following his friend's steps by opening up a chicken raising business but he had to abandon that activity due to a lethal epidemic that killed many of his hens. Sabado lives in his own home.\r\nSabado learned the trade by watching his friends do it since 1998. He has a permanent location on Namaacha Avenue in the town of Mazanbanine and its normal hours of operation are from 7:00am to 9:00pm -- these hours can be longer if there is a great influx of business. He has been engaged in this field for 6 years and with help from two employees he has been able to sell beer for 25,00mt, juices for 10,00mt and semea for 120,00 per bag. Sabado's income varies between 300,00mt and 1000,00mt per month and, depending on the business volume, it could reach as much as 2500,00mt. It is a goal to Sabado to expand and keep his business growing. \r\nHis plans for the near future are open up more establishments in the town where he lives and expand his business.\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Portuguese by Bertolt Cantalice, Kiva Volunteer<\/p> \r\n\r\nSabado tem 39 anos de idade e \u00e9 natural da prov\u00edncia de gaza. Sabado \u00e9 pai de 7 filhos com duas esposas sendo 5 filhos de uma mesma pessoa, com idades variando entre 18 e 8 anos de idade. Com a outra esposa Sabado tem dois filhos de 16 e 13 anos. Dos 7 filhos o mais velho j\u00e1 n\u00e3o vai a escola e os outros estudam. Para alem dos filhos Sabado sustenta a sua m\u00e3e que se encontra em Chokwe enviando valores monet\u00e1rios para ela.\r\n\r\nSabado estudou ate 4\u00aaclasse e diz que n\u00e3o continuou por ter perdido a vaga quando nas ferias do fim do ano viajou para outra prov\u00edncia e quando voltou j\u00e1 n\u00e3o havia vaga. Em 1980 mudou-se da prov\u00edncia de Gaza para Maputo a procura de melhores condi\u00e7\u00f5es de vida, logo apos a morte do seu pai. Em 1981 trabalhou no Vetagro-Boane, em 1995 trabalhou como seguran\u00e7a at\u00e9 1997, ano que demitiram trabalhadores e ele foi atingido. Em 1998 tentou seguir os amigos abrindo um negocio de cria\u00e7\u00e3o de  frangos que s\u00f3 veio deixar o mesmo em 2002 quando teve a quebra de morte dos pintos. Sabado vive na casa pr\u00f3pria.\r\n\r\nSabado aprendeu o negocio copiando aos amigos desde 1998. Tem um estabelecimento permanente sita na AV. Da Namaacha no bairro Mazanbanine. Exercendo atividades comerciais ha 6 anos, o estabelecimento funciona das 7:00h at\u00e9 21:00h excluindo os dias de muito movimento. Sabado tem dois empregados e tem vendido mais cerveja por 25,00mt, refresco por 10,00mt e semea por 120,00mt o saco. Sabado tem um rendimento entre 300,00mt e 1000,00mt por m\u00eas dependendo do movimento, pode ate fazer 2500,00mt por m\u00eas. Assim constitui como desafio para Sabado expandir ou manter o seu negocio.\r\n\r\nPara Sabado \u00e9 o segundo empr\u00e9stimo na Hluvuku e primeiro no Kiva e nunca teve empr\u00e9stimo em outras institui\u00e7\u00f5es. O primeiro foi de 15000,00mt com qual comprou mercadoria aumentando o seu stock. Assim com este empr\u00e9stimo Sabado quer comprar novamente mercadoria para de novo aumentar o stock e assim espera melhorar o seu negocio.\r\n\r\nO plano com o negocio daqui em diante \u00e9 abrir mais estabelecimento no bairro onde ele reside bairro 07 e futuramente ampliar os neg\u00f3cios."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":850,"image":{"id":171694,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Purchase merchandise to increase stock.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MZ","country":"Mozambique","town":"Boane, Maputo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-26.041667 32.325278","type":"point"}},"partner_id":23,"posted_date":"2008-06-19T22:50:12Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":850,"lender_count":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sabado Samuel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-07-12T13:54:42Z","disbursal_currency":"MZN","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":2222.22},{"due_date":"2008-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":2222.22},{"due_date":"2008-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":2222.22},{"due_date":"2008-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":2222.22},{"due_date":"2008-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":2222.22},{"due_date":"2009-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":2222.22},{"due_date":"2009-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":2222.22},{"due_date":"2009-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":2222.22},{"due_date":"2009-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":2222.24}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":94.44},{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":94.44},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":94.44},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":94.44},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":94.44},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":94.44},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":94.44},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":94.44},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":94.48}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":95,"local_amount":2235.29,"processed_date":"2008-07-30T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T05:14:25Z","rounded_local_amount":2265.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":281242},{"amount":95,"local_amount":2235.29,"processed_date":"2008-08-30T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-09-09T02:06:32Z","rounded_local_amount":2265.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":311077},{"amount":95,"local_amount":2235.29,"processed_date":"2008-09-30T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-01T07:22:42Z","rounded_local_amount":2265.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":342182},{"amount":92.78,"local_amount":2183.01,"processed_date":"2008-11-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-16T05:54:16Z","rounded_local_amount":2212.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5322621},{"amount":94.44,"local_amount":2222.22,"processed_date":"2008-12-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-15T23:12:10Z","rounded_local_amount":2252.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9941808},{"amount":94.44,"local_amount":2222.22,"processed_date":"2009-01-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-20T09:02:46Z","rounded_local_amount":2252.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14865418},{"amount":94.44,"local_amount":2222.22,"processed_date":"2009-02-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-03T08:20:53Z","rounded_local_amount":2252.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20407663},{"amount":94.44,"local_amount":2222.22,"processed_date":"2009-03-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-22T08:06:08Z","rounded_local_amount":2252.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27100574},{"amount":94.46,"local_amount":2222.24,"processed_date":"2009-04-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-20T08:28:04Z","rounded_local_amount":2252.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35994771}],"funded_date":"2008-06-28T13:54:42Z","paid_date":"2009-05-20T08:28:05Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":56918,"name":"Rima","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rima, 47 years old, is single and lives in a small village in the South of Lebanon.

He has been able to improve his business with the organizations that have funded him. Dom Demetrio\u2019s goals are to continue in this small business, as it is his major source of income. This loan is necessary for working capital to be put to good use in the purchase of products such as basic grains, chicken, meat, cheese and sodas. His goal is to obtain a clothing store, because he would like to learn another type of business. The loan is for C$6,000 c\u00f3rdobas ($300 USD).<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Rebecca Towle, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":284103,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Working capital","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Leon","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.435556 -86.879444","type":"point"}},"partner_id":96,"posted_date":"2009-03-12T21:00:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":300,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Demetrio Calixtro","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-02-27T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":6000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2009-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2009-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2009-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2009-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2009-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2009-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2009-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2009-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2009-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":600}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":30.26,"local_amount":605.26,"processed_date":"2009-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T18:37:39Z","rounded_local_amount":609.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27092133},{"amount":29.73,"local_amount":594.74,"processed_date":"2009-04-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T16:38:32Z","rounded_local_amount":599.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35985515},{"amount":30,"local_amount":600,"processed_date":"2009-05-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T23:09:41Z","rounded_local_amount":604.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44446134},{"amount":30,"local_amount":600,"processed_date":"2009-06-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T20:39:43Z","rounded_local_amount":604.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52956768},{"amount":180.01,"local_amount":3600,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T14:00:46Z","rounded_local_amount":3627.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63174192}],"funded_date":"2009-03-13T14:39:01Z","paid_date":"2009-08-15T14:00:46Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Rebecca Towle","image":225476}},{"id":97897,"name":"Jamuna","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Jamuna is a shopkeeper in the town of Chetrapati, Kathmandu.

For 20 years he has worked in the agriculture business. Today he grows rice (20 hectares), but when this product is consistent and growing he also works raising cattle. Now he has 80 animals which he feeds appropriately so that they gain weight and their size becomes attractive to customers. Glicerio is helped by his children and his wife who take advantage of the space on the land to plant products for their daily consumption. What Glicerio likes about this work is that it keeps him active and he can teach his children what he has learned. Also, it is very profitable business as he already has a stable rice buyer and always makes a net profit when selling cattle.\r\n<p>\r\nGlicerio has already gotten 11 loans with MFP. He likes the communal bank because his fellow members are very trustworthy and responsible. With the money from the loan he is asking for, Glicerio would buy about 100 soles worth of rice to plant, and with the rest and his savings would acquire a bull from good stock.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Kevin Credo, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":403131,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Purchase of seeds and a bull","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-10-10T05:10:16Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Glicerio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-09-09T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-09T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":350}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":175,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:56:28Z","rounded_local_amount":502.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103842995},{"amount":175,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-25T09:54:52Z","rounded_local_amount":502.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734571}],"funded_date":"2009-10-17T10:36:24Z","paid_date":"2010-01-25T09:54:52Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kevin Credo","image":null}},{"id":147156,"name":"Mirna","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Mirna Ordo\u00f1ez B. es una se\u00f1ora de 39 a\u00f1os de edad quien vive con dos de sus cuatro hijos.

She is married and has 4 children.  She lives in Hilata and finished elementary school.  She has been associated with the Manuela Ramos Movement for 6 years.  Her initial, 300 new sol, loan was used to buy small farm animals.  Currently, she needs a 700 new sol loan to buy sheep which she will later sell at retail (meat by the kilogram) in the local markets once a week.  Her greatest wish is to continue working so that she can afford her children's education.  She likes the savings and the way the loans are administered.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva

She lives with her spouse and their children in Hamdallaye, one of the quarters of Sikasso. Mrs. Ramatou O. has bought and sold food condiments for 30 years, following her mom's work since she was very young. \r\nWith the intention of better satisfying her ever-growing clientele, she decided to collaborate with the microfinance institution Soro Yiriwaso about seven years ago. She received several group loans with an association of women in Kadiolo Moumousso and is now on her fourth individual loan. All of her previous loans have been repaid in full.\r\nWith this loan, she plans on buying 12 cartons of tomato concentrate, six cartons of seasoning, three bags of pepper grains, three bags of dried onions, two bags of Lori\u00e9 leaves, five cartons of mustard, and other condiments at the large market in Sikasso. She sells her products at wholesale and retail. Sales are done cash and credit to customers and retail distributors at the new M\u00e9dine market where she does her business. \r\nWith this loan, she foresees making a monthly profit of 120,000 FCFA which she will use to contribute to her family's needs, pay the interest on the loan, and invest the rest in her business. She plans on someday becoming a wholesale distributor at the new market where she works in order to serve the retail distributors there who often have difficulty getting supplies.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Kelly Percival, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":541196,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"Purchase of condiments","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sikasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.316667 -5.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:18Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":750,"lender_count":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ramatou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-05-06T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":400000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2010-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":187.5},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":187.5},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":187.5},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":187.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":187.5,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:58:31Z","rounded_local_amount":100230.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166913576},{"amount":187.5,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:40:26Z","rounded_local_amount":100230.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182613409},{"amount":187.5,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-17T00:57:43Z","rounded_local_amount":100230.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191606120},{"amount":187.5,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:47:59Z","rounded_local_amount":100230.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206226088}],"funded_date":"2010-06-03T17:38:16Z","paid_date":"2011-05-15T11:47:59Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kelly Percival","image":null}},{"id":205271,"name":"Sokleang","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Sokleang T.

She is 45 years old. Jovita is married. To make a living, Jovita owns & operates a general store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from selling both food & daily use products in the local community. She also sells some livestock feed. Jovita has been engaged in her business for over 10 years and earns approximately 6000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2005, Jovita joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Jovita has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Jovita is requesting a new loan of 13,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional inventory and as working capital. This will be the 6th loan taken out by Jovita from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 29 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She earns her living by operating three business ventures: a general store, an electronic reloading business and a frozen products business. Her husband Richard D., who is 41 years old, works as a painter in Dubai. They have three children between 10 and 20 years old. \r\n\r\nElvira joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2009 because she aspired for something better for her family.  With the help of her past three loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Elvira has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 10,000 PHP helped her earn a monthly profit of 20,000 PHP, thus uplifting the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her fourth cycle loan, she is borrowing 10,000 PHP to use as working capital to continue to save for the future.  Elvira D. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means honorable). Through its alleviation program, NWTF is empowering women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass their dreams. They have chosen a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She says that this business is profitable and the major challenge she has is lack of a permanent place to run her business, making it difficult to work for long hours as well as retain customers. However, she works very hard to keep her business doing well. She is using her loan of Kes 60,000 to buy more clothes to grow her business and meet the demand of her customers. She hopes that in future, she will be importing clothes, shoes and bags. She describes herself as tolerant and responsible."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":743179,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Used

A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

Her husband, a taxi driver with unstable employment and income, leaves the responsibility of almost all of the household expenses up to his wife, who has difficulty paying them all. Setting up her business has not been easy for her because of her very limited means. With her belief in what she was doing and her courage, she succeeded in increasing her capital thanks to having obtained an initial loan of $250. Despite the fact that she is illiterate, she has an acute business sense and is rigorous in the management of her business, which has allowed her to repay her loan before the payment date.<p>\r\n\r\nShe is requesting a new loan of $750 to go to neighboring villages to buy tomatoes in bulk and sell them retail.

She sells children\u2019s clothes.  She is a very good sales person; she can always convince her customers to buy an article of clothing.  Carmen really enjoys talking with her neighboring vendors; it makes the long work day seem less tiring.  She has been doing this for 10 years.  What she likes least about her work is having to stay in her stand all day without being able to leave.  \r\n\r\nShe yearns to have a larger clothing store where she could sell her clothes more calmly.  This is her first loan with MFP.  She knows that she has to repay on time so that the she does not cause problems for the members of her community bank.

J. was born in Quelimane 47 years ago. He studied until 5th grade and in his free time helped his parents in house chores, and also helped raised his two younger brothers while his parents were at work. Back then, 5th grade was the highest level of education in Mozambique and Olimpio had to go to Cuba to continue his studies, thanks to a scholarship he received. He studied until 10th grade and from there was drafted into the army and did his training from 1982 to 1985.\r\n\r\nHe came back to Mozambique in 1985 and still works as a Marine in the Marinha de Guerra de Mozambique. He's been working for the army for the past 28 years from 7:30AM to 3:30PM and makes around U$385 per month, which he uses to support his family and save. He's was married in 1992 and had two children, a 16 and a 14 year old. His first wife passed away and he later remarried, and had two more children, a 7 and a 5 year old. All his children are going to school.\r\n\r\nOlimpio heard of Hluvuku from friends and has already taken 5 loans, this one being his 6th. He wants to finish building his house and also build a small business nearby, where he'll sell a little bit of everything, from food products to building supplies. He thinks he has chances to succeed because right now everyone has to go to the neighbor city of Maputo to get basic things, and starting his business will be like a dream coming true.<br

Her previous loan of 8,000 PHP helped her earn a profit of 32,000 PHP, raising her family's standard of living. This time, for her ninth loan, she is borrowing 10,000 PHP, which she intends to use as additional capital so that she can continue to save up for the future, to improve her business and pay for her daughter's education. Charisse D. C. is a 'Dungganon' woman who is following an honorable path toward achieving her dreams. \n\n About NWTF\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means 'honorable'). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them 'Dungganon' \u2013 a title of esteem that is bestowed on a member of the community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work. \n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":565814,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Phone Accessories","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"As additonal working capital","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Dalaguete, Cebu","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":145,"posted_date":"2010-07-15T13:50:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":225,"lender_count":4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Charisse","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":4,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":769.2},{"due_date":"2010-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":769.2},{"due_date":"2010-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":769.2},{"due_date":"2010-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":769.2},{"due_date":"2010-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":769.2},{"due_date":"2010-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":769.2},{"due_date":"2010-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":769.2},{"due_date":"2010-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":769.2},{"due_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","amount":769.2},{"due_date":"2010-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":769.2},{"due_date":"2010-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":769.2},{"due_date":"2010-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":769.2},{"due_date":"2010-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":769.6}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.31},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.3},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.31},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.31},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.31},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.3},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.31},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.31},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.3},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.31},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.31},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.3},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.32}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":72,"local_amount":3200,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:40:47Z","rounded_local_amount":3339.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159677630},{"amount":153,"local_amount":6800,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:41:55Z","rounded_local_amount":7096.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166891221}],"funded_date":"2010-07-15T13:59:42Z","paid_date":"2010-09-15T10:41:55Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Paul & Rachel Norridge","image":828426}},{"id":217577,"name":"Dominic Ole","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Dominic Ole Y. is 28 years old.

Modesto is a dedicated farmer. He plans to focus his efforts on the planting and harvest of cayenne and habanero peppers. He works in cooperation with his family to strike a balance between accomplishing the daily tasks associated with agricultural production and the completion of domestic responsibilities. The land he works is his own. In addition to his agricultural activity, Modesto feels it is important to be an active member of his community. As a result, he dedicates a significant portion of his time to community meetings, groups and events. The rural zone where Modesto and his family live is sparsely populated with infrequent bus service and a general lack of infrastructure. Modesto is working hard towards the sustenance of his family, striving to reap the maximum benefits from his land and his labour. \r\n\r\nAlthough this is an individual loan, the community in which Modesto and his family live is very close-knit and interdependent. Neighbours help and support one another by sharing experiences and expertise acquired over the years. All individual members of the Upala community are dedicated to the improvement of living conditions for the region as a whole.\r\n\r\nThis loan will be used to finance the production of cayenne and habanero peppers. Specifically, the loan will be used to finance the purchase of a variety of necessary agricultural nutrients, fertilizers and chemicals in order to ensure a healthy harvest. All labour and logistical tasks associated with production will be carried out by Modesto with the help of his family members in the region of Upala. The productive cycle (from planting to harvest) for these types of peppers is roughly one year. Modesto planted his peppers 4 months ago and will expect to harvest in the next 8 months. Typically, he dedicates the hours from 7:00 AM to 4:30 PM everyday to his agricultural activities. \r\n\r\nPiper and Capiscum Processors Compa\u00f1\u00eda Agr\u00edcola Industrial, or PROPICA, is an international buyer and seller of chili pepper and ground pepper products. In cooperation with Fundaci\u00f3n Mujer, PROPICA has guaranteed to purchase the agricultural products (the peppers) that are to be produced with the help of this loan. PROPICA acts as a guaranteed client for small agricultural producers in the area of Upala, thus ensuring that their products will reach market. \r\n\r\nThe main obstacle Modesto and other producers in the Upala community face is a lack of access to working capital funds.
