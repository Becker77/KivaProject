running through the streets of Nahuala shouting the names of their friends in the native Quiche language.  What is happening is that the members of the group are looking for their friends who are not present in the Friendship Bridge office for the payment.  Until all the clients of the communal bank are present, the loan cannot be repaid.  For many of the clients, the repayment of the loan is one of the most important events of the month.\r\n<p>\r\nThe meeting begins five minutes late, but with all members of the group in the office.  Many are a little anxious but happy to receive their first loan.  Others reflect the shyness typical of new clients.  This shyness will fade away in time, as the group consolidates and they all receive training about self-esteem and women\u2019s rights, among other themes of interest.\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAll the clients work in the textile industry. The majority work in traditional fabrics. Meanwhile others embroider flowers and birds in the typical blouses of the region. Finally, the rest of the group buys and sells clothes and traditional dress.  They are going to use the loan to buy the thread and clothes of their respective resale.\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIt is believed that once the clients start to receive a loan their opportunities and dreams will begin to flourish.  The women would like to learn about administration of their business.  By luck, Friendship Bridge offers training in the themes in which the clients have interest.  This basic training helps the women very much, especially those who are new to microfinance.\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nSurprisingly, the common dream among everyone is that their respective business can grow so that they can support and send their children to school. It is in our hands to support these women with their noble goals.  Few people spend so much effort for the benefit of others.  It is an admirable characteristic that people worldwide should imitate, and with our help these women can realize their dreams.\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<p><b>Translated from Spanish by Katrina H, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\n<P>Diez minutos antes de empezar la reuni\u00f3n de desembolso del grupo \u201cel Rosario Nahuala\u201d uno pod\u00eda ver grupos de se\u00f1oras, en sus trajes t\u00edpicos, corriendo por las calles de Nahuala gritando los nombres de sus compa\u00f1eras en el idioma Quich\u00e9. Lo que pasaba era que las integrantes del grupo estaban buscando a sus compa\u00f1eras que no estaban presentes en la oficina de Friendship Bridge para el desembolso, y hasta que no est\u00e9n todas las clientas del banco comunal el pr\u00e9stamo no se puede desembolsar. Para muchas de las clientas el desembolso del pr\u00e9stamo es uno de los acontecimientos m\u00e1s importantes del mes. \r\n\r\n<P>La reuni\u00f3n empez\u00f3 cinco minutos tarde, pero ya con todas las integrantes del grupo en la oficina. Muchas de ellas estaban un poco ansiosas pero felices por \u00a1recibir su primer pr\u00e9stamo! Otras, reflejaban aquella timidez t\u00edpica de clientes nuevas. Esa timidez se va borrando a trav\u00e9s del tiempo conforme el grupo se vaya consolidando y ellas vayan a recibiendo capacitaciones sobre autoestima y derechos de la mujer entre otros temas de su inter\u00e9s. \r\n\r\n<P>Todas las clientas trabajan en la industria textil. La mayor\u00eda trabaja en tejidos tradicionales. Mientras que otras bordan flores y aves en las blusas t\u00edpicas de la regi\u00f3n. Finalmente, el resto del grupo compra y vende ropa y trajes tradicionales. Ellas van a utilizar su pr\u00e9stamo para la compra de hilo y ropa para su respectiva reventa.\r\n\r\n<P>Se cree que una vez las clientas empiezan a recibir pr\u00e9stamos sus horizontes y sue\u00f1os empiezan a agrandarse. A las se\u00f1oras les gustar\u00eda aprender m\u00e1s sobre administraci\u00f3n de sus negocios y medicinas. Por suerte, Friendship Bridge ofrece capacitaciones en los temas que las clientas est\u00e1n interesadas. Este tipo de capacitaciones b\u00e1sica ayuda mucho a las mujeres, especialmente a las que reci\u00e9n empiezan en las microfinanzas.\r\n\r\n<P>Sorprendentemente, el sue\u00f1o com\u00fan de todas es que su respectivo negocio pueda crecer para que as\u00ed puedan alimentar y mandar a sus hijos al colegio. Est\u00e1 en nuestras manos apoyar a estas se\u00f1oras con sus nobles metas. Pocas personas avocan todos sus esfuerzos para el beneficios de otros. Esto es una caracter\u00edstica intachable de la cual muchas personas en el mundo deber\u00edan de imitar y solo con su apoyo estas se\u00f1oras van a poder cumplir sus sue\u00f1os."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3275,"image":{"id":140214,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Embroidery","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"Purchase

from Tanzania! Latifa R. was born thirty-five years ago; she's married with two children, ages 10 and 16. In 2005, Latifa established her poultry business (kuku) which enables her to earn a monthly profit of 500 USD. Raising kuku is a popular micro-business in Tanzania, especially amongst SELFINA clients. Who or what are \"kuku,\" you may ask. Kuku means \"chickens\" in Swahili, and raising them for sale is popular for a number of reasons. They require little start-up capital: you can start with two and wait for them to multiply naturally! They also require little space, so sometimes you can just let them run around in your garden or compound. Latifa is requesting the loan of 875 USD in order to purchase 400 chicks and additional feed. In the future, Latifa plans to buy even more chicks and expand her business further!\r\n<P>\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of microcredit in Tanzania. The organization is devoted to the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through microfinance as a practical way to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women. Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets; because of this, they are deemed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support, hence poor access to basic needs and services. When a client needs working capital to buy a specific item, SELFINA buys the equipment for said client and extends a loan to her. The same equipment is then leased back to the client so they can use it while in process of paying back their loan, a process called a sale-and-leaseback arrangement. Once the loan has been repaid, SELFINA transfers the ownership of the equipment to the client. The advantage of microleasing over traditional microfinance loans is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":875,"image":{"id":192703,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy additional chicks and feed for her poultry business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Dar es Salaam","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-6.8 39.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-08-30T17:50:31Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":875,"lender_count":32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Latifa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-09-13T19:21:27Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":1000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":875,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2008-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2008-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":88,"local_amount":100571.43,"processed_date":"2008-10-11T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-21T07:17:58Z","rounded_local_amount":101904,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356221},{"amount":87,"local_amount":99428.57,"processed_date":"2008-11-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T04:18:57Z","rounded_local_amount":100746,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5347974},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2008-12-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:09:06Z","rounded_local_amount":101325,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9970548},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-01-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:13:36Z","rounded_local_amount":101325,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14886765},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-02-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:02:26Z","rounded_local_amount":101325,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20436025},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-03-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:54:56Z","rounded_local_amount":101325,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130298},{"amount":87.49,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-04-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:23:17Z","rounded_local_amount":101325,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027129},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-05-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:12:55Z","rounded_local_amount":101325,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613169},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-06-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:01:01Z","rounded_local_amount":101325,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010252},{"amount":87.51,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-07-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:37:48Z","rounded_local_amount":101325,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63232563}],"funded_date":"2008-08-30T19:21:27Z","paid_date":"2009-08-15T18:37:48Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":65537,"name":"Aida","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Aida N. est une femme ag\u00e9e de 59 ans .elle est mari\u00e9e et habite au quartier Cit\u00e9 Lamy de thi\u00e8s .elle fait du commerce de denr\u00e9es alimentaires  et quelque fois des tissus depuis vingt ans elle sollicite ce pret pour le renforcement de ses activit\u00e9s.","en":"Aida N., 59, is married and lives in the Cit\u00e9 Lamy neighborhood in Thi\u00e8s.

She lives with her husband and children in the Missira neighborhod of the town of  S\u00e9gou (fourth administrative region of the Republic of Mali). <P>\r\n\r\nNever having attended school because of socio-economic reasons, she had very religious parents who saw the \"white man's school\" as the road to perdition. Since she was very young, she busied herself with petty trading, working with her mother who sold rice. Rich in experience gained at her mother's side, she decided after her marriage to go out on her own and has been in business for 20 years, selling various items (thermos bottles, prepaid phone cards, dishes, shoes, portable phones, etc.) and has a very good reputation. <P>\r\n\r\nIt is with the intention of increasing her working capital that she joined Soro Yiriwaso, 30 months ago. After 1 individual loan and 3 solidarity loans, all correctly reimbursed, she is on her second individual loan which will be used to buy 50 thermos bottles, 10 pairs of shoes, 3 dozen bowls, 10 portable phones, and a carton of prepaid phone cards from \"Orange\" cell telephone server. She buys her telephones and rechargeable cards in Bamako; her thermos bottles, bowls and shoes come from Ghana. She sells for cash and credit, out of her home and door-to-door, to a clientele composed primarily of men. She expects to make an average monthly profit of 70,000 F CFA which will be used to add to her savings, buy some animals little by little, and reimburse the loan. <P>\r\n\r\nHer ambition is to save as much as possible so as to build a house to live in. \r\n \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Teresa Kramer, Kiva

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.  But Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's history:\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He is a hard-working person, which he demonstrates each and every day as he carries out the arduous tasks of living in the countryside. Abdufatto has been a farmer from the start, having inherited his lands \u2013 and the occupation \u2013 from his parents. With the passing of time, he has also implemented raising livestock into his enterprise. Each day, he takes his cows to graze in the far reaches of his fields. With these activities, he earns income to support the living expenses of his family. Abdufatto is learning every day how to run his business to the best end result. He seeks a loan for working capital, specifically so he can buy cattle, considering that the prices for them are low now. Abdufatto deeply appreciates the trust and support you are giving him.  \r\n \r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes: its role as a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and its famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets including Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous, and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment, forcing hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is forty-eight years old. Cecilia is married and has one school-aged child. To make a living, Cecilia owns and operates a business venture in the services sector operating a service-based business. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from providing party services to local community members. Cecilia earns approximately 500 PHP daily for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Cecilia joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Cecilia is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional inventory and working capital. This loan will be the third loan Cecilia has taken out from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has twenty-five branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolks, and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She is married and has a one year old daughter, who her mother helps care for.  Her husband works as a collector for the Caf\u00e9 Soluble plant.  She works as a teller in a bank.  She has been doing this for one year, but her salary is low.  She also works with the new businesses in the capital city on the weekends, where she can earn a little extra, but this limits the time she is able to spend with her family.  She also gets off of work very late and she is often afraid when traveling home, because of the crime along her route.\r\n\r\nHer plans are to move into another position that will provide better income, which will allow her to complete the improvements to her small home, which she and her husband have managed to build.

This parish produces large quantities of milk since the majority of the population works in agriculture and raising cattle. Much of the population has emigrated to various places around the world in search of a better quality of life for their families. \r\n\r\nOur partner is 40 years old, married with 3 children ages 20, 18 and 6. Her two older children work and help economically while her husband can't find steady work, but does so when he is hired as a master bricklayer. Their joint efforts have allowed them to build their own home. Maria takes care of the daily household chores as well as raising chickens, guinea pigs, pigs and cattle which she sells when the need arises. \r\n\r\nShe has been our partner through two cycles and is very happy with her friends in the group. Her new loan will be invested in the purchase of fertilizer for the grazing field so she can feed her cattle properly since her goal is to keep growing the business. \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Solson Scherman, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":566586,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Purchase Fertilizer","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Cuenca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2010-07-13T16:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":675,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Lastenia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-06-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":660,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2010-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2010-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2010-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2010-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2010-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2010-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2010-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2010-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2010-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2010-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":55}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":110,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:10:34Z","rounded_local_amount":112.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159632991},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":110,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:14:54Z","rounded_local_amount":112.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166847025},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":110,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:07:25Z","rounded_local_amount":112.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172113481},{"amount":56.25,"local_amount":55,"processed_date":"2010-10-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T13:57:46Z","rounded_local_amount":56.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177407131},{"amount":56.25,"local_amount":55,"processed_date":"2010-10-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T13:58:36Z","rounded_local_amount":56.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177407132},{"amount":56.25,"local_amount":55,"processed_date":"2010-11-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-21T10:29:47Z","rounded_local_amount":56.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":183388214},{"amount":56.25,"local_amount":55,"processed_date":"2010-11-17T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-21T10:30:32Z","rounded_local_amount":56.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":183388215},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":110,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T13:10:20Z","rounded_local_amount":112.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188682772}],"funded_date":"2010-07-13T22:20:24Z","paid_date":"2011-01-15T13:10:20Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":217981,"name":"Yuliya","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Yuliya is married.

With the economic downturn and being on a fixed income, she saw the need to have a business. She made this decision two years ago, to sell cosmetics and lingerie to people she knows. Since then, she has been selling to more customers, working with them in their homes, selling to them on credit. She always maintains order in her business; she attempts to record all the products she sells and the pending credit that each customer has. She has now set goals for the future since her business has brought in good revenue. In the future she would like to have more merchandise and more customers.

She, together with her husband and children, manages their household while operating the business.\r\n\r\nElvira operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a PHP 5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. Elvira earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located inside her house. At the same time, she earns additional income by sewing or repairing clothes and pants. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 300 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operating her business, she is requesting a PHP 9,000 loan. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory and for the maintenance of her sewing machine. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nElvira hopes to be able to expand soon and dreams of being able to give her children a good and high quality education through all her hard work in her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners.

Ahmatillo has been in touch with the countryside. His family dedicated themselves to cultivating fruits and vegetables and he imagined he\u2019d be in the business of selling produce. Fortunately, he has realized this dream. At the age of 22, he began to sell fruit and vegetables in small markets. Little by little, he saved money so he could set up his own shop.

It was a key post along the Silk Road and is where the rule of Alexander the Great ended. It is famous for its great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets such as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to epic mountain passes, communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n\r\n<p>But, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Zafar is a 42-year-old farmer who lives with his family, consisting of two children and his wife (pictured). He has two milk cows and sells dairy products to the local and capital traders. Zafar has 6 years of experience in raising cattle and selling dairy products. The milk products are in very high demand in his village. Zafar\u2019s orders for these products are very high but the milk his cows give is not enough for traders and he decided to apply for 800 USD to purchase an additional cow and fodder. Zafar is very grateful to everyone who is helping him to improve his living with this loan. <P>\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International<P>\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.<P>\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.<P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n<P>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.  But Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's history:\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Ruth has been farming for 29 years now, selling her milk and staple goods to the Kenya Cooperative Creameries and local market respectively. She also runs a kiosk and posho mill in the same building. The two businesses have enabled her to earn a living and meet her family's expenses. \r\n\r\nShe has requested this loan through Juhudi Kilimo for Ksh 25,000 to improve her poultry project.

She is married and the mother of one son who is 19 years old and attends school.  She completed school through the 10th grade but could not continue due to a lack of financial resources.  She lives in her own home with her family and supports 2 stepchildren who live with her.  \r\n\r\nShe left Inhambane for Boane when her father was transferred for work when she was just 2 years old.  She has been working as a maid for over 2 years and has a monthly salary of 1.300.00mt which she uses for household expenses.  With the help of her husband who is a stonemason, she is able to save a bit of money through xitique (a traditional rotational savings plan). \r\n\r\nShe has never had a loan with other banks.  She learned about Hluvuku through neighbors who are clients of this institution.  This is her 4th loan, in the amount of 11.000.00mt, which she will use to purchase construction material (cement, sand, stones, etc.) to continue building her home.  Her previous loans were for 5.000.00mt, 5.800.00mt, 6.000.00mt for housing and business. She promises to pay back this loan on schedule in order to have access to additional loans.  In the future she plans to request more loans to complete construction.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Michele Magrino, Kiva

de comidas y la contrat\u00f3. Luego de unos meses la hija de Alida le coment\u00f3 que en vez de trabajar para otros deb\u00eda trabajar lo suyo de manera propia. Entonces Alida un dia sintonizando la radio escuch\u00f3 la publicidad de FAMA y se aboc\u00f3 a las oficinas a solicitar un prestamo, el cual unos dia despues le fue otorgado por Lps. 2,000 y solamente con ese poco de dinero comenz\u00f3 con una venta de golosinas. Actualmente su negocio a crecido y ahora es un comedor y se llama Comedor Ingrid, trabaja sola, y su horario laboral inicia desde las 6:00 am y culmina las 4:00 pm y tiene una muy buena clientela. Su meta es llegar a tener un local propio ya que donde tiene instalado su comedor es alquilado y el costo es alto. Ademas sue\u00f1a en que poco a poco su peque\u00f1o comedor se ira convirtiendo en un restaurante de comida buffet.\n\nEl prestamo que Alida solicita lo necesita para comprar refrescos, agua, jugos, verduras, salsas, carnes, pastas, pollo, embutidos, frijoles, arroz, platano, azucar, cafe, lacteos, entre otros productos necesarios para la elaboracion de las comidas. Alida confia que con el apoyo de este financiamiento pueda comprar todo lo necesario para surtir su negocio y mantenerlo activo, y que pueda obtener ganancias para cubrir los gastos mas necesarios de sus hijos y hogar.\n\nAlida tiene mas de 5 a\u00f1os de trabajar con los prestamos de FAMA y siempre ha cancelado sus cuotas puntualmente, y con tambien ha podido ampliar su negocio y ha mejorado su vivienda.\n\n \n\n","en":"Alida is 44 years old, and works selling food and drink.  She is married with one daughter and three sons, and lives in La Colonia Trochez in the municipality of Juticalpa. \r\n\r\nAlida learned this trade eight years ago, thanks to one of her friends who had a food stand and hired her.  Several months later Alida's daughter suggested to her that instead of working for other people, she should work for herself.  So one day Alida was tuning the radio and heard the advertisement for FAMA, and she took herself to the offices to request a loan.  Some days later, they offered her Lps.2,000, and with only this small amount of money, she started selling candy. \r\n\r\nToday, her business has grown and now she has a diner called \"Comedor Ingrid\".  She works on her own; her works schedule starts at 6 a.m. and goes till 4 p.m., and she has a very good customer base.

He is a very hard working young man who lives in his own home with his dear, 5-year old son, Dayron.  He instills in his son the importance of education.  Even at his young age, Erick is focused on his responsibilities and obligations.  Life has given him obstacles, but he is undaunted.  Today he tries to excel at growing cacao, coffee and citrus fruits.  After harvesting his plants, he brings them to the city of San Francisco to sell.  In San Fransisco, he has various purchasers who are familiar with the quality of his products and are always sure to wait for him to purchase his whole crop.  What Erick likes most about his work is planting his fields and making them fertile and productive.  He has been in this line of work for 6 years and feels that the most difficult part is spraying his parcels of land, which is something he must do very carefully so that the chemicals don't damage his health.  In the future, he hopes to keep saving his earnings so he can purchase additional land.  This is Erick's second loan with MFP, and he hopes each one of you can help him, as he knows the money he will be loaned will be very beneficial in the progress of his labor.  He is happy to a part of the group of members that make up his communal bank.  With the requested money, Erick will contract day laborers to help him maintain his crops: pruning, clearing and spraying.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":925,"image":{"id":872514,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to contract day laborers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-09-20T15:40:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":925,"lender_count":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Erick ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-09-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":213.88},{"due_date":"2011-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":218.7},{"due_date":"2011-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":229.15},{"due_date":"2012-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":235.05},{"due_date":"2012-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":243.63},{"due_date":"2012-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":255.76},{"due_date":"2012-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":261.84},{"due_date":"2012-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":272.41},{"due_date":"2012-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":280.67},{"due_date":"2012-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":288.91}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.14},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":80.91},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":84.79},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":86.97},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.14},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":94.63},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.88},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100.8},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":103.84},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.9}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":79.14,"local_amount":213.88,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:55:50Z","rounded_local_amount":216.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238666546},{"amount":80.91,"local_amount":218.7,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:43:12Z","rounded_local_amount":220.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244621695},{"amount":84.79,"local_amount":229.15,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:49:40Z","rounded_local_amount":231.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250835777},{"amount":86.97,"local_amount":235.05,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:18:59Z","rounded_local_amount":237.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257245536},{"amount":90.14,"local_amount":243.63,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:31:33Z","rounded_local_amount":246.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263385588},{"amount":94.63,"local_amount":255.76,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:27:41Z","rounded_local_amount":258.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270098660},{"amount":96.88,"local_amount":261.84,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T10:29:02Z","rounded_local_amount":264.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276712882},{"amount":100.8,"local_amount":272.41,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:29:52Z","rounded_local_amount":275.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283201985},{"amount":103.84,"local_amount":280.67,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-16T08:34:27Z","rounded_local_amount":283.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287097775},{"amount":106.9,"local_amount":288.91,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:11:26Z","rounded_local_amount":291.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294400657}],"funded_date":"2011-09-28T02:18:28Z","paid_date":"2012-08-15T10:11:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Marni Siegal","image":829283}},{"id":340953,"name":"Trinidad","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Trinidad, a 39-year-old married mother of four school-aged children, lives in the village of Katipunan in Sinacaban, Misamis Occidental, Philippines.

When she first joined TYM, she just borrowed 50 USD because she wanted to get used to the weekly repayments policy.  The profit she earned after the first year was not a whole lot, yet it helped her gain more confidence for the next loans.  With Ms. N.'s cleverness, there is a significant increase in her family income.  The loan is used more efficiently.  Each month she earns about 100 USD from making sedge mats.  With the savings from many years, she is able to build a new house.  Ms. N. is very happy because TYM Fund helps her have a better life and her children are able to go to school.  Now Ms. N. is thinking about breeding fish.  Since the cost of food is increasing, she needs more money to buy good food for her fish.  Thus, she would like to borrow 375 USD to buy breeding fish and fishfood.\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Vietnamese by Phuong Nguyen, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nCh\u1ecb Nguy\u1ec5n Th\u1ecb Nguy\u1ec7t, 37 tu\u1ed5i, l\u00e0 th\u00e0nh vi\u00ean n\u0103m th\u1ee9 4 c\u1ee7a Qu\u1ef9 T\u00ecnh th\u01b0\u01a1ng.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n\r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Umedullo is a young clothing merchant from Dushanbe, Tajikistan. He started his small business when he was in his late 20\u2019s and gradually, though much hard work, has been able to develop it into quite a successful enterprise. Umedullo has the qualities it takes to succeed as an entrepreneur. Goal-oriented, hard-working and punctual, he is a natural business man.\r\n\r\nFunding from IMON International has been instrumental in helping Umedullo build his business. His first loan was for $600 and since that time he has benefited from one additional loan while establishing a great credit history.\r\n\r\nHe has now requested a loan of 6200 Somoni to add to his available working capital. The ability to purchase large quantities of inventory in bulk saves time and expense for merchants such as Umedullo. He would like to buy a supply of women\u2019s and children\u2019s clothing that will boost his inventory before the busy summer season.\r\n\r\nUmedullo appreciates the availability of funding through IMON International. It allows him to take advantage of good opportunities and focus on growing his business so that he is able to adequately provide for himself and his family.  \r\n \r\n\r\n<b>More about Tajikistan and IMON International<\/b>\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is 35; married; and the mother of 3 children who are 17, 14, and 10.  All of them go to school.  She studied only through the 7th grade and stopped due to an untimely pregnancy.  She lives in her own home with her family in neighborhood 5 in Boane.  She doesn't support anyone besides her family.  She left for Matola for Boane in 2008 with her family and built her home in Boane.  She has had her own business for 2 years and buys and sells chickens.  She buys chicks for 19 meticais and sells the chickens for 95 meticais.  She has 2 workers, and she works from 9 am.-2 p.m.  Her monthly income is around 5,000 meticais, with which she supports her family and saves some via a tradtional rotating savings system known as Xitique.  She has never had a loan with another bank.  She became familiar with Hluvuku through her neighbors.  This is her first loan and it is for 11,000 meticais.  She will use it to buy chicks and feed to increase her quantity of chickens and respond to the demand for her product during the holiday season that is approaching.  She promises to pay back this credit on time so she will be able to receive more loans.  In the future, she hopes to buy vehicle that will help her transport her merchandise.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Tanya Harper, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":433106,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To raise chickens","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MZ","country":"Mozambique","town":"Boane, Maputo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-26.041667 32.325278","type":"point"}},"partner_id":23,"posted_date":"2009-11-24T02:10:14Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.82,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alice","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-11-10T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MZN","disbursal_amount":11000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":18,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":551.05},{"due_date":"2010-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":566.9},{"due_date":"2010-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":583.21},{"due_date":"2010-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":599.99},{"due_date":"2010-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":617.25},{"due_date":"2010-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":635.01},{"due_date":"2010-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":653.27},{"due_date":"2010-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":672.07},{"due_date":"2010-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":691.4},{"due_date":"2010-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":711.29},{"due_date":"2010-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":731.75},{"due_date":"2010-11-05T07:00:00Z","amount":752.8},{"due_date":"2010-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":774.46},{"due_date":"2011-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":796.74},{"due_date":"2011-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":819.66},{"due_date":"2011-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":843.15}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.04},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.61},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.21},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.82},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.44},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.09},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.76},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.44},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.14},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.87},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.61},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.37},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.16},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.97},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.81},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.66}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":46.49,"local_amount":1278.49,"processed_date":"2009-12-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T14:23:53Z","rounded_local_amount":1361.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110709073},{"amount":89.25,"local_amount":2454.3,"processed_date":"2010-02-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:27:23Z","rounded_local_amount":2614.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123938192},{"amount":47.72,"local_amount":1312.21,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-24T07:49:05Z","rounded_local_amount":1397.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123938193},{"amount":48.01,"local_amount":1322.61,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:14:41Z","rounded_local_amount":1408.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.08,"payment_id":128972059},{"amount":100.65,"local_amount":2767.98,"processed_date":"2010-06-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-25T07:43:41Z","rounded_local_amount":2948.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151916086},{"amount":64.06,"local_amount":1864.41,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-09T07:47:35Z","rounded_local_amount":1985.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.74,"payment_id":159878513}],"funded_date":"2009-11-24T03:55:37Z","paid_date":"2010-10-09T07:47:35Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tanya Harper","image":783083}},{"id":160026,"name":"Rosa","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Rosa es socia del Banco Comunal \u201cJes\u00fas de Nazaret\u201d, en el distrito de Ilave, provincia de El Collao, departamento de Puno.

Marie Dolly is the group leader of a three-member group loan offered by PMPC.

The official name of this borrowing group is Marie Dolly C.\u2019 Group.\r\n\r\nMarie Dolly is blessed with four children, two of whom are married while the other two are teenagers and presently studying in high school.  For their living, she decided to engage in operating a sari-sari (variety) store business and in selling barbeque sticks. She is supported by her husband, Marcial, who is a farmer.  For 25 years she has maintained her business activities and at this time she is earning an average net income of not less than $90 a month, which is so helpful to their family income.\r\n\r\nUpon hearing the good news of PAGLAUM MPC being one of the most outstanding cooperatives in Northern Mindanao, awarded for being the Most Outstanding Cooperative in the Philippines (during the search for COOP-LGU Partnership Award 2006), she joined the cooperative this year, 2010. \r\n\r\nAs a newly recognized member of the PDP-LP Program of PAGLAUM MPC, a micro-finance program that reaches out the rural poor, Marie Dolly is requesting an amount of 4,000 PHP for her first loan, to be used as additional capital for her businesses. \r\n\r\nThe future income from this loan will be used to improve the living conditions of her family, to meet their basic needs, to make loan repayments to PMPC, to pay for her children\u2019s education and for possible business expansion.\r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n Paglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model. \r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nShirly is separated from spouse and has 2 school-aged children. To make a living, Shirly owns & operates a business venture in the food sector making & selling food. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling ice cream to the local community. Shirly has been engaged in her business for over 10 years and earns approximately 5000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2006, Shirly joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Shirly has successfully repaid a previous loan of 12,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Shirly is requesting a new loan of 15000 PHP which will be used to purchase new items to expand product offering. This loan will be the 8th loan taken out by Shirly from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of the borrower's family. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 38 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to epic mountain passes, a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC, and communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still lives in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

That statement should be taken with a grain of salt. It may be a little farfetched, but one can\u2019t rule out the fact that indeed some entrepreneurs did get some business training.\r\n\r\nA study carried out recently showed how some business people are nodding acquaintances when it comes to efficiently operating businesses. That proficiency is lacking, but still most businesses, however petty they are, are making headway. This has puzzled most business experts, but it is the status quo that we are all bearing witness to.\r\n\r\nIf the above, particularly the part that talks about the fact that most people lack business training, is referenced to 42-year-old Kate, an assiduous clothes sales business entrepreneur plying her trade in Jinja, it could hold water. It\u2019s now 15 grueling and chequered years in this business for Kate, who at her age has no kids yet.\r\n\r\nShe says being devoid of business skills has not played havoc with any of her operations, though she says if she had got the training, she probably would be operating her business in a more worthwhile and proficient way.\r\n\r\nHer maiden business was a retail shop and Kate says she utilized her savings to set forth in her cloth sales trade.

I earn about 40 or 50 PEN per day, but the best days are during Easter, national holidays and Christmas, because of all the visitors.\", she explains.  In the future, Nicolasa wants to expand her business and set up another sales point because she knows it is profitable.  \r\n\r\nThis is her second loan through MFP thanks to your support, and she is committed to paying it back on time.  She is happy with her communal bank group because she knows that through teamwork she can achieve more.\r\n\r\nShe plans to use the loan to buy supplies for her business such as crates for cheese, trays of fudge, sodas and mineral water.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":933780,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To buy crates to store cheese, trays for fudge, sodas and mineral water.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-12-02T09:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nicolosa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-11-21T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":141.13},{"due_date":"2012-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":152.92},{"due_date":"2012-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":161.61},{"due_date":"2012-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":172.85},{"due_date":"2012-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":180.64},{"due_date":"2012-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":190.85}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.92},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.35},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.6},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.82},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.74},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.57}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":52.92,"local_amount":141.13,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:51:34Z","rounded_local_amount":143.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250836237},{"amount":57.35,"local_amount":152.92,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:31:30Z","rounded_local_amount":155.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263386023},{"amount":125.42,"local_amount":334.46,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:30:13Z","rounded_local_amount":339.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270099113},{"amount":67.74,"local_amount":180.64,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T10:28:52Z","rounded_local_amount":183.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276713272},{"amount":71.57,"local_amount":190.85,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:28:00Z","rounded_local_amount":193.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283202147}],"funded_date":"2011-12-19T02:42:49Z","paid_date":"2012-06-15T18:28:00Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sherry Bess","image":833485}},{"id":369667,"name":"Abdurashid","description":{"languages":["ru","en"],"texts":{"ru":"\u0410\u0431\u0434\u0443\u0440\u0430\u0448\u0438\u0434 39 - \u043b\u0435\u0442\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u043c\u0443\u0436\u0447\u0438\u043d\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0436\u0438\u0432\u0430\u044e\u0449\u0438\u0439 \u0432 \u0440\u0430\u0439\u043e\u043d\u0435 \u0428\u0430\u0445\u0440\u0438\u0442\u0443\u0441. \u041e\u043d \u0436\u0435\u043d\u0430\u0442. \u041e\u043d \u044f\u0432\u043b\u044f\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u043e\u0442\u0446\u043e\u043c \u0447\u0435\u0442\u0432\u0435\u0440\u044b\u0445 \u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0439. \u0410\u0431\u0434\u0443\u0440\u0430\u0448\u0438\u0434 \u0437\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0440\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435\u0432\u043e\u0434\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e\u043c. \u041e\u043d \u0432\u044b\u0440\u0430\u0449\u0438\u0432\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u043e\u0432\u043e\u0449\u0438 \u0434\u043b\u044f \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0430\u0436\u0438. \u042d\u0442\u0438\u043c \u0432\u0438\u0434\u043e\u043c \u0434\u0435\u044f\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438 \u0437\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0448\u0435\u0441\u0442\u044c \u043b\u0435\u0442. \u041a\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0438\u0442 \u0431\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0442 \u0434\u043b\u044f \u0437\u0430\u043a\u0443\u043f\u0430 \u0442\u043e\u043f\u043b\u0438\u0432\u0430 \u0438 \u043c\u0438\u043d\u0435\u0440\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u0443\u0434\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0439.","en":"Abdurashid is a 39 year-old man, living in the Shahrituz district.

He cannot continue his education since college has become very expensive and Alisher was forced to take an academic break. To earn money for his studies Alisher works as a builder for hire. He also raises calves, sheep and goats in a small barn that he owns and sells the animals after fattening them. Since the prices for livestock are currently slightly lower, he wants to buy more sheep and goats. However, Alisher needs additional funding for this purchase and he has decided to take out this loan. This way he will be able to expand his herd and increase the earnings from animal sales. Alisher is planning to pay back the loan in the next 12 months\r\n\r\n<p><b>Translated from Russian by Anya Lyuksyutova, Kiva volunteer<\/b><p>\r\n\u0420\u0438\u0437\u043e\u0435\u0432

After several years, the investments are producing results.

Both say that their incomes are totally independent of one another.

All of their businesses face stiff competition but the members are experienced and know how to manage their businesses and work with equanimity.  Generally, the loan will be used to buy basic supplies, make the businesses more productive and allow the members to spend the time they save with their families.

Rahima is 42 years old. She is married and has a son. She owns a specialized fabrics store at the central market in the town of Penjikent. Rahima works in a sphere of trade where the demand is always very consistent and high, because the national dresses of Tajikistan are very popular and a very important item of the dowry of any girl. She is one of the leading fabrics vendors in the market where she works. She is very persistent and determined in all of her business endeavors, which has helped to sustain her venture for 10 years. \r\n<p>\r\nRahima is a skilled entrepreneur. When she started this trade, she implemented the basic concepts of integrity and hard work in her business in order to attain ultimate success. This laid a firm foundation for winning results and Rahima has obviously been a successful small entrepreneur. \r\n<p>\r\nHowever, she doesn\u2019t want to stop.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to epic mountain passes, communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 percent of the country is mountainous and only 7 percent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\nIMON's History\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She lives in the suburn of Quimbiri, located in the top of the Peruvian jungle, where she has her own house made from wood. Sof\u00eda is a woman characterised by courage and humility, of which she has both. She recognises that she has had failures in the past, one of these in agricultural activity, owing to the changes in climate which damaged her cocoa plantation, making it unable to be sold. But Sof\u00eda's will and determination made her continue to cultivatecocoa and little by little the crops recovered. Now she has a complementary job, in the afternoons providing a by-hand laundry service, where she has many loyal customers. She is satisfied by the earnings she obtains as they help her cover her domestic costs. Sof\u00eda has left her farm under the care of her partner, who looks after the plagues that can affect her cocoa plantations. Her future plan is to purchase a washing mashine, so she can minimise time and costs. This is Sof\u00eda's first loan with MFP, and she promises to meet the payment timeline. With the loan she is seeking she will invest in the purchase of soaps, brushes, bleach, and detergents, to be able to do her job well. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jane McCrory, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":542230,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Laundry","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"Purchase cleaning products","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"CUSCO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.518333 -71.978056","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-05-20T07:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sofia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-05-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":85.58},{"due_date":"2010-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":88.58},{"due_date":"2010-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":90.69},{"due_date":"2010-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":93.98},{"due_date":"2010-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":98.14},{"due_date":"2010-11-06T07:00:00Z","amount":101.57},{"due_date":"2010-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":105.13},{"due_date":"2011-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":108.41},{"due_date":"2011-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":112.6},{"due_date":"2011-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":115.32}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.09},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.22},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.01},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.24},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.8},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.09},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39.43},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.65},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.23},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.24}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":32.09,"local_amount":85.58,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:02:55Z","rounded_local_amount":91.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151934537},{"amount":33.22,"local_amount":88.58,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:36:51Z","rounded_local_amount":94.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159673307},{"amount":34.01,"local_amount":90.69,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:39:35Z","rounded_local_amount":96.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166887134},{"amount":35.24,"local_amount":93.98,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:25:57Z","rounded_local_amount":100.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172154143},{"amount":36.8,"local_amount":98.14,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T15:13:41Z","rounded_local_amount":104.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177449454},{"amount":38.09,"local_amount":101.57,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:01:15Z","rounded_local_amount":108.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182588128},{"amount":39.43,"local_amount":105.13,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T14:03:45Z","rounded_local_amount":112,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188724721},{"amount":40.82,"local_amount":108.85,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T04:39:47Z","rounded_local_amount":115.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191462929},{"amount":42.06,"local_amount":112.16,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T08:52:40Z","rounded_local_amount":119.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195886442},{"amount":43.24,"local_amount":115.32,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:36:34Z","rounded_local_amount":122.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201326718}],"funded_date":"2010-05-20T13:28:03Z","paid_date":"2011-04-15T11:36:34Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jane McCrory","image":240040}},{"id":205739,"name":"Janet","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Janet is a married woman with one child who goes to school.

pig-fattening business. She lives in Ilog, Negros Occidental. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 1998 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 8,000. Arly is borrowing PHP 19,500 to fund her business operations. This will be her 14th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 19,500, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Arly aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future wellbeing by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

He has also learnt to take stock of what will create a bigger niche for his business and how to make the best out of bad business bargains. In this kind of business, one is destined to climb the ladder of financial success as long as you continuously restock because demand for food will be high, even if food prices rise. Dodovico has always strived to restock whenever he runs short on supplies. \r\n\r\nThis business was started with cash savings from his previous charcoal and timber trade.

This means that individuals operating that business will be in a position to restock the business every time the restaurant runs short on food.\r\n\r\nWith the current status quo where food prices are rising day in, day out, a person involved in this enterprise may fail to sustain it without a robust capital base. Joushua says this is not likely to happen in his business as he has quite a sufficient working capital. Not so big, he says, but at least strong enough to ensure he remains in business. It's just that he has other business operational expenses, which at times constrain his capital base and make it hard for him to make enough food purchases.\r\n \r\nThis business generates 18,000 Ugandan shillings weekly in sales revenue. This is quite paltry given the fact that food prices are up and most restaurant owners are increasing their food prices. Though his weekly sales revenue is minimal, he is not one to get disconsolate. He reckons he will be able to make sales income once he can get this loan to improve operations at his business. This Kiva loan, he says, is to aid him in the purchase of more food for his restaurant.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1850,"image":{"id":812783,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Restaurant","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to purchase more food for his restaurant.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Jinja","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.583333 33.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":84,"posted_date":"2011-07-16T00:30:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1850,"lender_count":65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Joushua","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Moses","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Emmanuel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"George William","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"David","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"James","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Faizal","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Daniel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nicholas","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-07-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":4800000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":1850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1200000},{"due_date":"2011-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1200000},{"due_date":"2011-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1200000},{"due_date":"2011-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":1200000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":462.5},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":462.5},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":462.5},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":462.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":462.5,"local_amount":1200000,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-16T08:24:38Z","rounded_local_amount":1204812.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227248977},{"amount":925,"local_amount":2400000,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-04T09:29:06Z","rounded_local_amount":2409625,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238868547},{"amount":462.5,"local_amount":1200000,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-06T09:23:00Z","rounded_local_amount":1204812.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244648381}],"funded_date":"2011-07-16T14:48:48Z","paid_date":"2012-01-06T09:23:00Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Dave and Brigette Walters","image":1883687}},{"id":320478,"name":"Collpani Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La A.C. \u201cCOLLPANI\u201d iniciar\u00e1 su tercer ciclo en Pro Mujer, como parte del Centro Collpani, est\u00e1 compuesta por nueve integrantes y est\u00e1 dirigida por una mesa directiva encabezada por la se\u00f1ora Rosmery.

I need a loan of USD 250 to buy a new stitching machine that can make peco and over-lock as well."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":73080,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Tailoring","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"Buy a latest stitching machine","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PK","country":"Pakistan","town":"Multan","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"30.195556 71.475278","type":"point"}},"partner_id":60,"posted_date":"2007-10-09T18:40:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":250,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Manzoor","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-10-23T20:42:12Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":250,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2007-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2008-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2008-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2008-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2008-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2008-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2008-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2008-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2008-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2008-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2008-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":20.87}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2008-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2008-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":20.87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":21,"local_amount":21,"processed_date":"2007-11-23T10:24:46Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-28T21:35:58Z","rounded_local_amount":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":85651},{"amount":21,"local_amount":21,"processed_date":"2007-12-23T10:18:47Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-28T21:37:39Z","rounded_local_amount":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":101657},{"amount":21,"local_amount":21,"processed_date":"2008-01-23T10:15:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-28T21:38:30Z","rounded_local_amount":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":120608},{"amount":21,"local_amount":21,"processed_date":"2008-02-23T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-28T21:40:32Z","rounded_local_amount":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":140774},{"amount":21,"local_amount":21,"processed_date":"2008-03-23T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-28T21:44:35Z","rounded_local_amount":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":164398},{"amount":21,"local_amount":21,"processed_date":"2008-04-23T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-28T21:47:44Z","rounded_local_amount":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":189461},{"amount":21,"local_amount":21,"processed_date":"2008-05-23T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-28T21:54:44Z","rounded_local_amount":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":217516},{"amount":21,"local_amount":21,"processed_date":"2008-06-23T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-28T21:59:24Z","rounded_local_amount":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":246471},{"amount":21,"local_amount":21,"processed_date":"2008-07-23T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-28T22:06:38Z","rounded_local_amount":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":274970},{"amount":21,"local_amount":21,"processed_date":"2008-08-23T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-28T22:16:57Z","rounded_local_amount":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":304495},{"amount":21,"local_amount":21,"processed_date":"2008-09-23T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-09-24T07:12:27Z","rounded_local_amount":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":335418},{"amount":19,"local_amount":19,"processed_date":"2008-10-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-28T07:08:52Z","rounded_local_amount":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":369333}],"funded_date":"2007-10-09T20:42:12Z","paid_date":"2008-10-28T07:08:52Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":24630,"name":"Valentina Paulino","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Valentina is married and has three children, two boys and a girl, each a year apart at fourteen, fifteen, and sixteen years old.

This is 43-year-old Mwazani M M.. She is a married woman with two children between 16 and 18 years old. \r\n<p>\r\nMwazani has been running a tomato business since 2000. She buys tomatoes from farmers, brings them into town, and sells them at a higher price. Tomatoes are very common in Tanzania. Roasted tomatoes with onions can be mixed with cooked meat or fish or anything to make food more delicious. Mwazani\u2019s business is able to make a monthly profit of about 500 USD. Now Mwazani is requesting a loan of 1300 USD in order to purchase more tomatoes. She is  planning to open another business in the coming days. She thanks you for your support!\r\n<p>\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, so they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that it allows clients to use their equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":224137,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To purchase more tomatoes for resale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Dar es Salaam","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-6.8 39.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-11-13T02:10:22Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1050,"lender_count":29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mwazani ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-11-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":1300000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":1050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":130000},{"due_date":"2009-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":130000},{"due_date":"2009-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":130000},{"due_date":"2009-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":130000},{"due_date":"2009-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":130000},{"due_date":"2009-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":130000},{"due_date":"2009-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":130000},{"due_date":"2009-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":130000},{"due_date":"2009-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":130000},{"due_date":"2009-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":130000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":105},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":105},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":105},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":105},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":105,"local_amount":130000,"processed_date":"2008-12-25T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:13:35Z","rounded_local_amount":130200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9970744},{"amount":105,"local_amount":130000,"processed_date":"2009-01-24T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:15:08Z","rounded_local_amount":130200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14886961},{"amount":105,"local_amount":130000,"processed_date":"2009-02-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:03:47Z","rounded_local_amount":130200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20436221},{"amount":105,"local_amount":130000,"processed_date":"2009-03-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:56:29Z","rounded_local_amount":130200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130493},{"amount":105,"local_amount":130000,"processed_date":"2009-04-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:24:22Z","rounded_local_amount":130200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027290},{"amount":105,"local_amount":130000,"processed_date":"2009-05-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:13:54Z","rounded_local_amount":130200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613313},{"amount":105,"local_amount":130000,"processed_date":"2009-06-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:01:45Z","rounded_local_amount":130200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010396},{"amount":105,"local_amount":130000,"processed_date":"2009-07-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:38:24Z","rounded_local_amount":130200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63232707},{"amount":105,"local_amount":130000,"processed_date":"2009-08-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:52:28Z","rounded_local_amount":130200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73664523},{"amount":105,"local_amount":130000,"processed_date":"2009-09-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T02:45:58Z","rounded_local_amount":130200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87105254}],"funded_date":"2008-11-15T19:48:08Z","paid_date":"2009-10-16T02:45:58Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Susan Olson","image":null}},{"id":77901,"name":"Firmes Y Bendecidos #5 Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Iris A. is a Haitian women living in the Dominican Republic trying to better her life.

She uses her work in carpentry to send her children to school.  After fourteen years of experience in the carpentry business she was able to, with much effort, open her own business six months ago.  She works there with one assistant, who does the heaviest work.  Her business is popular among the people, and they place many orders that she fulfills on time and with much pleasure as she enjoys transforming raw wood into a useful piece.  Although there are hidden risks in her business, she has no doubts about giving it all her effort and sacrifice.  This is the first loan that Yolanda realizes with Microfinanzas Prisma.  She hopes to complete all her payments and have access to another loan soon.  She will use the funds to purchase more lumber, which will result in her being able to augment the production of furniture in her carpentry workshop.   <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Mary Lynn Malaby, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":262301,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Carpentry","sector":"Construction","themes":null,"use":"To purchase a greater quantity of raw wood.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Juliaca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15.5 -70.133333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-01-28T01:30:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Yolanda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-13T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":165}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":54.28},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":54.28},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.28},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.28},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.28},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.6}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":54.28,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-02-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T20:04:50Z","rounded_local_amount":168.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20423723},{"amount":54.28,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-03-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:37:50Z","rounded_local_amount":168.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27116992},{"amount":54.27,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-04-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:46:26Z","rounded_local_amount":168.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36011913},{"amount":54.28,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T01:02:19Z","rounded_local_amount":168.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44595513},{"amount":54.28,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-06-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:40:15Z","rounded_local_amount":168.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52989752},{"amount":53.61,"local_amount":165,"processed_date":"2009-07-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:42:35Z","rounded_local_amount":166.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63210891}],"funded_date":"2009-01-28T03:56:02Z","paid_date":"2009-08-15T16:42:35Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":90189,"name":"Tika Shari","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Tika Shari R. lives in Thikedewal, Lalitpur.

She is 38 years old. Vicky is married and has 7 school-aged children. To make a living, Vicky owns and operates a specialized business. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from  engaging in traditional gold mining known as pamiling. They work hard so that they can pan enough gold for the day and sell it for the needs of the family. Sometimes, if they have enough capital,  Vicky is the one who buys the gold from her co-miners and delivers it to the city.<P>\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Vicky joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Vicky has successfully repaid a previous loan of 8000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to to invest in expanding the business. Vicky is requesting a new loan of 11,000 PHP which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This loan will be the 3rd loan taken out by Vicky from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay for the education of her children. <P>\r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:<P>\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.<P>\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which began soon after it became independent from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients are able to borrow money. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She has 3 children, all of which are small.  They are 12, 7, and 2 years old.  Herminia and her children live in Vilomilla, a zone of Sipe-Sipe.  Her husband left them a year ago.\r\n<p>\r\nHerminia works in the milk-producing businesses.  She has cows which produce milk and she makes cheese to sell to her neighbors.  She also temporarily grows beans in her home, which help her to maintain her home and her small children.  The conditions in which they live are meager.  They have a house with two bedrooms and she keeps her cattle on the same property.  Herminia is responsible for the feeding, education and health of her children, and she does all of her tasks with her small 2-year-old girl.\r\n<p>\r\nHerminia is requesting this loan to be able to improve the infrastructure for her cattle, and provide a balanced diet to them so that they produce more milk.  She wants to care for her source of income, which is why she has requested the loan.  Herminia wants to see her children grow to be healthy, strong, responsible workers like she is, have better living conditions, a house with better commodities, and always be capable of facing any difficultly that life gives them.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Kathleen O&#039;Connell, Kiva

A few years ago, he used his savings from a previous job to start his own business selling women's, men's, and children's clothing, underwear, and a variety of other products.  It has not been easy since the demands are intense.  In the market, there are many stores in a row, but they all do well.  There are good times and bad times.  With a financial investment, the store has stocked good products, which have generated good earnings.  Each day, he invests more to achieve a balance between his sales and his expenses.  The difficulty is that clothes that don't sell in months are sold at a discount.  Therefore, he tries to invest in a lot of clothing to make more sales and not lose a lot of money.\r\n\r\nWith this loan, Mario will buy children's clothes and shoes to attract clients and meet his sales objective.  Thanks to his strength, he has succeeded in supprting his children with their studies.  He also brings them to work with him so that they can get experience with the store.  \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Eileen Gessner, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":542255,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"Buy children's clothing and shoes to increase sales","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Managua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.150833 -86.268333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":98,"posted_date":"2010-05-20T14:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":675,"lender_count":26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mario Enrique","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-05-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":14000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1166.67},{"due_date":"2010-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1166.67},{"due_date":"2010-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1166.67},{"due_date":"2010-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1166.67},{"due_date":"2010-11-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1166.67},{"due_date":"2010-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":1166.67},{"due_date":"2011-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":1166.67},{"due_date":"2011-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":1166.67},{"due_date":"2011-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":1166.67},{"due_date":"2011-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1166.67},{"due_date":"2011-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1166.67},{"due_date":"2011-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1166.63}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":133.99,"local_amount":2778.96,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T09:03:13Z","rounded_local_amount":2843.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159562124},{"amount":57.33,"local_amount":1189.13,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T09:17:52Z","rounded_local_amount":1216.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166771031},{"amount":56.58,"local_amount":1173.51,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-16T07:45:49Z","rounded_local_amount":1200.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172204923},{"amount":57.96,"local_amount":1202.07,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T12:03:11Z","rounded_local_amount":1230.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177330619},{"amount":56.93,"local_amount":1180.78,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T11:43:03Z","rounded_local_amount":1208.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182465773},{"amount":57.18,"local_amount":1185.92,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-19T09:09:34Z","rounded_local_amount":1213.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":189097913},{"amount":57.42,"local_amount":1190.92,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T00:48:26Z","rounded_local_amount":1218.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191348511},{"amount":56.27,"local_amount":1167.14,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:07:06Z","rounded_local_amount":1194.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195766186},{"amount":141.34,"local_amount":2931.57,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T09:56:28Z","rounded_local_amount":3000.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201209258}],"funded_date":"2010-06-16T18:17:18Z","paid_date":"2011-04-15T09:56:28Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Eileen Lloyd","image":721623}},{"id":205755,"name":"Ban","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Ban S. is 28 years of age, married to Mr. Chin, age 40, and they have no any children.

She lives in San Carlos City, Negros Occidental. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2010 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her dressmaking\/tailoring business, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 5,600. Jesusita is borrowing PHP 10,000 to purchase raw materials. This will be her 19th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 10,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Jesusita aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future wellbeing by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She is 64 years old, happily married, and blessed with nine lovely children. She lives with her family in the Litein area of Kenya. Her children are her greatest motivation in life to persevere because she wants to provide them with a better future. \r\n\r\nRusi was unable to study to get a professional career because of the economic situation that her family faced. However, she never gave up, and she has been practicing farming for the past 15 years. Rusi always says, \u201cI have always had an affinity for farming, and it runs in my blood.\u201d Because of how much she likes farming, she has even nicknamed one of her cows \u201cLelkina\u201d, which makes her a very proud farmer, especially when she is milking her cows. Through her dairy cow, she is able to get between 10-15 liters a day, and this helps her support her family. \r\n\r\nRusi also practices crop farming, but she has not been making good profits because of poor farming implements. That is why she is kindly seeking a loan to buy farm implements. Through the loan, she will be able to buy high-quality seeds, good fertilizer, and pesticides that she will use to greatly improve her crop production. Modern farming requires the use of modern techniques, and therefore using high-quality seeds will assure her of a bumper harvest and hence, increased profit levels. \r\n\r\nRusi is very visionary, and her goal for the season is to boost her crop production and be able to get more crop output than the previous year. All this can be achieved through lenders\u2019 help and goodwill. \r\n\r\nRusi believes that through the loan, she will turn around her family life and be able to give her child a solid educational background.

Within a year a breeder sow usually produces twice, bearing 7 to 10 piglets, each piglet on the average is worth Rp 150.000 (about USD20). For 2 hours each day, he set aside time for this, in the morning between 6-7 and afternoon after returning from farming. Currently, he already own 4 breeder sows of the local breed.
