While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for her business comes primarily from selling a variety of different products in the local community. Gaudencia has been engaged in her business for over three years and earns approximately 3000 PHP a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Gaudencia joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Gaudencia has successfully repaid a previous loan from PMPC. Gaudencia is requesting a new loan of 5000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the second loan taken out by Gaudencia from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She has established a store that sells traditional clothing worn by Tanzanian women, called kanga and vitenge. The kanga is a piece of printed cotton fabric often with a border along all four sides. It is printed using the silkscreen method with its pattern in frames. Kitenge (the Swahili plural is vitenge) is a cotton fabric with wax print, printed by using rotary printing machines. Kitenge is a communicating textile - the various colors, patterns, writings and symbols represent moods, feelings, cultures, and traditions of native African people.\r\n She works at her business for 12 hours per day, 7 days per week and is assisted by her husband.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro-leasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n              \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":424011,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"To purchase more vitenge in bulk","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbeya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.9 33.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-11-12T20:10:15Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":775,"lender_count":26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Tegemea A.","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":1000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":166666.67},{"due_date":"2010-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":166666.67},{"due_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":166666.67},{"due_date":"2010-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":166666.67},{"due_date":"2010-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":166666.67},{"due_date":"2010-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":166666.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":129.17},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":129.16},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":129.17},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":129.17},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":129.16},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":129.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":129.17,"local_amount":166666.67,"processed_date":"2009-12-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T16:47:10Z","rounded_local_amount":171468.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110757644},{"amount":129.16,"local_amount":166666.67,"processed_date":"2010-01-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:34:55Z","rounded_local_amount":171468.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118146738},{"amount":129.17,"local_amount":166666.67,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T11:16:29Z","rounded_local_amount":171468.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123984883},{"amount":129.17,"local_amount":166666.67,"processed_date":"2010-03-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-10T13:01:46Z","rounded_local_amount":171468.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":129015556},{"amount":129.16,"local_amount":166666.67,"processed_date":"2010-04-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-10T13:03:34Z","rounded_local_amount":171468.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136740562},{"amount":129.17,"local_amount":166666.65,"processed_date":"2010-05-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-10T13:04:59Z","rounded_local_amount":171468.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144773676}],"funded_date":"2009-11-16T12:24:10Z","paid_date":"2010-12-10T13:04:59Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":155543,"name":"Delia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La socia DELIA pertenece al banco comunal \u201cVIRGEN ASUNTA, ella vive en el distrito de calca de la provincia de Urubamba del departamento del Cusco.

He plans to use his 6,000 LRD portion of this 30,000 LRD group loan to buy more slippers to improve his business. His goal is to grow and expand his business and to improve his family's living conditions.\r\n\r\nIn the photo that accompanies this profile, James is the one holding the sign.\r\n\r\nAbout LEAP:\r\nThe Local Enterprise Assistance Program (LEAP) is Liberia's largest and oldest continuously operating microfinance institution with 13 branches across the country. Founded in 1994, the non-profit organization has survived periods of civil war and severe socio-economic hardship. LEAP seeks to help rebuild post-conflict Liberia through its group and individual loans to micro- and small-scale entrepreneurs, and puts emphasis on lending to women.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":523047,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Shoe Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To buy more slippers to improve his business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"LR","country":"Liberia","town":"Red Light, Paynesville","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"6.5 -9.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":141,"posted_date":"2010-04-15T16:20:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"James ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Musu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Zinah","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Keabeh","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"LRD","disbursal_amount":30000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1239},{"due_date":"2010-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":2213},{"due_date":"2010-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":2213},{"due_date":"2010-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":2213},{"due_date":"2010-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":2213},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2213},{"due_date":"2010-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":2213},{"due_date":"2010-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":2213},{"due_date":"2010-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":2213},{"due_date":"2010-06-29T07:00:00Z","amount":2213},{"due_date":"2010-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":2213},{"due_date":"2010-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":2213},{"due_date":"2010-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":2213},{"due_date":"2010-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":2205}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.55},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.35},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.35},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.36},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.35},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.35},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.35},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.35},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.35},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.35},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.35},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.35},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.35},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.24}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":66.58,"local_amount":4700,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:33:13Z","rounded_local_amount":4724.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136711581},{"amount":144.5,"local_amount":10200,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-17T07:50:09Z","rounded_local_amount":10252.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144998131},{"amount":180.62,"local_amount":12750,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-21T07:43:27Z","rounded_local_amount":12815.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":152755706},{"amount":33.3,"local_amount":2350,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:32:53Z","rounded_local_amount":2362.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159667030}],"funded_date":"2010-04-15T21:16:27Z","paid_date":"2010-08-15T11:32:53Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sharon K-S","image":1103477}},{"id":197189,"name":"Vicenta","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Vicenta R. reside en el departamento de La Uni\u00f3n, vive junto a su hija y dos nietos de 4 y 5 a\u00f1os de edad.

To her, it\u2019s worth the effort and fatigue; few people sell clothing in these places, so there are plenty of potential customers.

The business has been established since 2007 and he has six years of experience in this occupation.\r\n\r\nDespite his young age, the borrower is very supportive of his father, who works as a farmer, and he helps him with the household expenses. Today, he is requesting to borrow $1,200 from Kiva partner Ameen s.a.l. so as to be able to expand his business by adding new services and purchasing more equipment. He will also be able to attract new clients.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>Note:<\/b> Based on the political and social challenges of Lebanon, personally identifiable attributes of this entrepreneur have been altered to protect him or her (e.g. blanking out portions of the entrepreneur in his\/her picture, not indicating his\/her name and location, etc.). Ameen s.a.l. appreciates Kiva lenders' understanding of these challenges and encourages lenders to continue their support for Lebanon's borrowers.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>About Ameen:<\/b>\r\nAmeen s.a.l. has been a major player in the Lebanese micro-finance sector since 1999.

It is made up of hardworking and enterprising people who are always on the lookout for opportunities to get ahead, and who make a daily effort to provide a better future for their children.  The group meets every 30 days in the central offices of the Instituci\u00f3n de Micro finanzas Arariwa, which is located in the Wanchaq district of Cusco province.  The majority of the members work in retail trade.\r\n\r\nMonica, 33, was born in the city of Cusco.  She now lives in the city where she was born with her husband and their 2 children.  Before, Monica used to work as a street vendor selling ceviche on the corner of Dolorospata street in the Santiago district, but as there is a lot of pollution in the area she closed that business.\r\n\r\nDetermined to start a new life, Monica used her savings to open a small grocery store where she sells rice, sugar and many other items.  There you can find her every day of the week, from 6 in the morning until 8 at night.\r\n\r\nWith her next loan, Monica hopes to receive 300 Peruvian soles.  Right now, her store is modestly supplied with the basic necessities.  Monica would like to use the money from the loan to buy calling cards.  She would like to open a store that is bigger, or have a seafood restaurant.  Monica is one of the founding members of the communal bank, and she is a person who is responsible and punctual.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Lisa Grobar, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2375,"image":{"id":588650,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy calling cards","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"CUSCO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.518333 -71.978056","type":"point"}},"partner_id":119,"posted_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:20Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2375,"lender_count":85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Monica","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Esteban","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Claudia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Santos","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Viviana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Navieth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Patricio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Jose Carmen","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Polonio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alejandro","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Justino","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sabina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-08-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":6600,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":2375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1555.81},{"due_date":"2010-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1618.06},{"due_date":"2010-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":1682.8},{"due_date":"2010-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":1743.33}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":559.86},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":582.25},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":605.56},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":627.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":559.86,"local_amount":1555.81,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T09:44:03Z","rounded_local_amount":1567.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172071192},{"amount":582.25,"local_amount":1618.06,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T13:02:54Z","rounded_local_amount":1629.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177362489},{"amount":605.56,"local_amount":1682.8,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T13:05:50Z","rounded_local_amount":1694.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182497384},{"amount":627.33,"local_amount":1743.33,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T12:26:19Z","rounded_local_amount":1755.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188632527}],"funded_date":"2010-09-09T10:37:35Z","paid_date":"2011-01-15T12:26:19Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lisa Grobar","image":264298}},{"id":229964,"name":"Amethyst","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Amethyst P. is from the village of Poblacion III.

She earns her living by operating two business ventures: a tailoring business and a sari-sari (general) store.

They have four children who are 13 to 28 years old.  \r\n\r\nAdela joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2000 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 17 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Adela has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 15,000 PHP helped her earn a monthly profit of about $94, thus raising the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 10th cycle loan, she is borrowing 17,000 PHP, which she intends to use to purchase raw materials so that she can continue to save up for the future and to put up her own tailoring shop. Adela E. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

Tohir is helped by his wife. He is currently faced with many problems because his children are growing and, accordingly, their expenses are growing too. The only way to get out of this difficulty is to succeed in business, so we hope that the capabilities and services provided by IMON International will help him improve the business.  \r\n\r\n \r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

They live in the Tlapala community on the banks of the centre of Chalco, in Mexico City. A group of five women, they decided that their group would be called Las Margaritas because they like flowers, especially daisies, because they are beautiful. They each feel comfortable with each other, as the mutual support they offer each other is important.\r\nCandelaria B. G., 49, is proud to be from the state of Oaxaca. Her husband works as a mason and they have four grown children, three of whom are married and one who is single. She has sold merchandise for 20 years, as she is a person who looks after her family and helps her parents, who still live in Oaxaca. Candelaria used to sell food, but had to stop because of illness, so she decided to learn a new business that would not require much work. She started selling cleaning products like: fibers, Clarasol, pine, buckets, tubs, sodas, etc. The people who buy her products say that her service is very good and they continue to buy. She wants to have a fixed location to sell her products, so that she is not mistreated and can have a little more stock, and can fix up her house a little more.\r\nThe other members are: Ang\u00e9lica F. Hern\u00e1ndez (grocery and dairy products sales), Adela Victoria C. (chicken sales), Teresa M. S. (fruit and vegetable sales) and Maria Elena L. (store).

Sarah Joy has successfully repaid a previous loan of 8000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional products to sell. Sarah Joy is requesting a new loan of 11000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional inventory & working capital. This loan will be the 3rd loan taken out by Sarah Joy from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand the business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, we created this template for our field staff to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":582262,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

Annet says she set forth in her current grocery store enterprise after the demise of her husband. She was at her wits end, and coming to grips with her predicament was the turning point. With 12 kids to provide welfare for, Annet knew she had to do something to bring substantial value to their lives. What exacerbated her situation from the start is the fact that she did not have any prior business experience. But, with conviction, she conquered the odds stacked against her. \r\n\r\nThe grocery business has now lasted five years. It is located along Kamuli Road which is near the Jinja metropolis.

five children.  He is an economist by profession and spent his working career from 1976 through 1992 at the local collective farm.  Their father's vision and his active and fruitful work inspired Narynbek's children to obtain a higher education.  Two of his children - daughter Janyl and son Kutman became economists, and two other sons, Azamat and Jamanak, and daughter Aida became certified linguists.  Due to the fall of the collective farm system. Narynbek decided to start his own business of animal husbandry.  Persistent and tenacious Narynbek was able to develop his business to include 10 cows, 7 horses and 5 goats today.  In order to further expand his business, Narynbek went to the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company to request a loan in the sum of 100,000 som (KGS) to buy two horses.  He will invest part of the income into a purchase of a house, thus helping his daughter to buy her own place.  In the future, Narynbek plans to further increase livestock headcount.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2225,"image":{"id":871175,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

Work availability is the factor on which Rojita\u2019s husband's income depends. She joined the Mangalleima Women's group to support herself with her weaving business and also to support other group members in need. All group members live in the same area which is about 40 kms away from the capital town of Manipur, and which is also one of the northeastern states in India.\r\n\r\nRojita weaves women's traditional wrap-around skirts using a loom. She usually gets the weaving materials like yarn and thread from the main market and weaves them. The finished woven products sell well during wedding seasons, as they are one of the main items a woman usually takes along to her in-laws house. The generated income is not sufficient to purchase weaving yarn and thread in abundance as she also shares the family's financial burden. \r\n\r\nTo meet the demand of her customers, Rojita will purchase good quality yarn and thread with her Kiva loan and weave them. With the income she will open an account and start saving. She also says she will regularly repay the loan amount on time. She wishes to purchase a two-wheeler scooter for her husband so that he won\u2019t be late for work and can efficiently perform his duty. She thanked Kiva and WSDS for the help and wishes to continue working under their sponsorship. She says, \u201cThank you, Kiva!\u201d\r\n\r\nThe rest of the group members are also engaged in weaving, poultry, piggery and rice-selling businesses.\r\n"}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1424994,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Weaving","sector":"Arts","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To purchase good quality yarn and thread for weaving ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"New Keithelmanbi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":238,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1575,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sanajaobi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rojita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ibetombi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Aruna","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Inaobi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ibemhal","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Inaocha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tombi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maimu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Indrani","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-09-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":100000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":1575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1575}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":726455,"name":"Ansarul Isl Pri Ii Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Salone Microfinance Trust (SMT), a partner of Kiva.org in Makeni, Northern Sierra Leone, is pleased to present to you this group of teachers.

His is 29 years old and studied through the 9th grade.  He supports 5 people (even though he lives with just 3) and is married.  He grew up and lived the majority of his life with his mother and siblings.  While he was a student in his free time he took classes in tailoring and practiced karate.  For the last 10 years he has been working as a tailor; sewing and doing emboidery.  He also gives sewing classes and is a sewing machine repair technician.  He employs three people, one with 5 children, another with 2 and the last with one.  With the loan for 12,000MT he plans to purchase fabric, thread and dyes.  He runs the business out of his home which enables him to open the shop at 8:00 and work for 16 hours.  His employees come using public transportation, some travling a great distance.  The raw materials are purchased in Maputo or in South Africa, and transported on public busses.  Summer is his high season since his customers re-sell his goods in open air markets or on the beaches where domestic and foreign tourists can shop and buy his products.  The average weekly income is 3,000MT - and he has a system to record the purchase of raw materials, good produced and goods sold.  His business is currently doing well and provides a monthly return of 10,000MT which he uses to care for his family, pay his employees' salaries, do some home repairs and even save a little.   For the future he plans to expand his business and to purchase additional sewing machines - to do this he will have to take out an additional loan to guarantee the success of this expansion.  His customers are very satisfied with his work and his main objective is to increase the volume of orders and hire additional employees to meet the growing demand.<p><b>\r\n\r\nTranslated by Kiva

She started in September of 2004, selling food on a table in front of her house, with help from her mother. The business was doing well so when an opportunity to buy a small cart presented itself, and she bought the cart to have more space to sell cakes. Because Rosura only sells meals at night, Rosura spends her days selling clothing to her friends, neighbors, and relatives. This business has also taken off. Rosura's previous loan with Kiva was invested in raw materials to make food, but Rosura will invest this new loan partially in materials and partially in clothing to sell.\r\n\r\nRosura needs a loan of US$400, which she will repay in 5 months.

namely in grain and vegetable growing. She wishes to launch this business because she has the possibility to buy new clothes with a very low price so she can earn very good profit in the future. She is 59 years old but she is a mother of two children that are pupils in the middle school in Copceac village.

He is 47 years old. Antonio is married and has 9 school-aged children. To make a living, Antonio works in a family member's business venture in the services sector, providing recycling services. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from hauling plastics and other recyclables for local businesses and community members. Antonio has been engaged in his business for over 20 years and earns approximately 5,000 PHP a month for these activities.<p>\r\n\r\nAntonio joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Antonio is requesting a new loan of 15,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional plastics and other recyclables to sell. This loan will be the fifth loan taken out by Antonio from ASKI. He plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement his family's income. <p>\r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:<p>\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.<p>\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

With her vending business, she earns approximately 3,000 PHP a month.\n\nAniceta joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan from ASKI.\n\nAniceta is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business. \n\nAbout ASKI:\n\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\n\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from selling Tupperware or plastic products like lunch boxes, food containers, etc. in the local community. Agustina is just starting this business.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2008, Agustina joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Agustina has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from GDMPC. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional products to sell. Agustina is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This loan will be her fourth loan from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n<p>\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n<p>\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three unit offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n<p>\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

From an early age his parents taught him to love the land and how to work it. As a young man he grew corn but it was very hard work and brought him little profit. Now Rey sells popsicles and ice cream, a job he\u2019s been doing for sixteen years. He started out by selling from his house, then in his community of Curungueo, and finally as all was going well, he started going to other communities such as Macho de Agua and R\u00edo De Guadalupe amongst others. He walks around to sell his wares, outside primary schools for example, and when school is out, he sells in the streets of the communities. \r\n\r\nNow Rey is seeking a loan from Kiva partner Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad to buy more stock and also to buy ice cream cones, glass containers for ice cream, and another cooler as the one he has is very old.\r\n\r\nRey\u2019s needs are many as he has a family to help get ahead in life. He wants to add more rooms to his home which is no longer big enough since several of his children still live at home. He says, \u201cI want to give them a better life and buy more beds so that they don\u2019t all sleep together. Before, my house had no floor but thankfully sales increased so I was able to take out loans and put in a concrete floor. For this reason I am still working with a finance company because it has helped me provide my children with a better quality of life.\u201d\r\n\r\nRey has been married for thirty years to Sra. Amalia. They have six children. The oldest is called Mariana; she is married and has two children. Then there are Armando and \u00c1ngeles, aged 24 and 22. They both help Rey with household expenses such as buying gas or firewood, and paying the electricity bills. When they are able, they help pay for the school expenses of Miriam (18) and Liliana (13).

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n<P>\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":285229,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Tailoring","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"To buy vitambaa (material), vitenge (a traditional Tanzanian cloth with wax print), and kanga (printed cotton fabric often with a border along all four sides)","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mwanza","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.516667 32.9","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-03-09T20:40:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Pendo","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-03-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-04-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:23:56Z","rounded_local_amount":104160,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027592},{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-05-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:13:29Z","rounded_local_amount":104160,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613593},{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-06-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:01:37Z","rounded_local_amount":104160,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010672},{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-07-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:38:12Z","rounded_local_amount":104160,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63232958},{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-08-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:52:20Z","rounded_local_amount":104160,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73664749}],"funded_date":"2009-03-09T23:34:26Z","paid_date":"2009-09-15T21:52:20Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Michelle Archer","image":162079}},{"id":98057,"name":"Awa","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Madame Awa S. a pour l\u2019activit\u00e9 la vente de savon et le savon en poudre pour faire la lessive.

He received training from our organization and has also invested in farming and pig rearing. \r\n\r\nComing back to our organization, P. is looking for a loan to be able to start a firewood selling business. In this area, it is very common for people to use fires rather than stoves for their cooking, and P. sees that there is much need for greater access to this resource. That being the case, P. is looking to buy a hammer, chisel, axe and wood to be able to distribute his firewood throughout the community. \r\n\r\nWith his past loan activity, P. invested the gains in educating his children, improving his home, buying piglets for his farm, and for trading in his community. This next loan will also be used for some of the same purposes. P. would like to continue his children\u2019s education and ensure their good health, and he would also like continue improving his home, being able to plaster the walls of his house. He is sure that this business will succeed because of the large market demand and because of his ability to sell the wood at a reasonable price.\r\n\r\nP. originally came to GHAPE because of the reasonable rates on the loans and also because of what he has gotten out of them. He has learned how to manage his money, how to run a profitable farm, and has also learned about how to educate his children.\r\n\r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon. GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach.

Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement. GHAPE instills a sense of family and community within its clients and staff and has developed a strong bond of trust between the organization and its clients."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":363356,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fuel\/Firewood","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Purchase of hammer, chisel, axe, firewood, transport of materials ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CM","country":"Cameroon","town":"Alabukam, Mankon, NW.

Since she was 20 years old she started her business. She learned the business from her mother since she was a young girl when she lived in the city of Soledad, another municipality near Barranquilla. When she moved of Malambo she started her business there. She started out by selling shoes, clothing and other merchandise and the business was overseen by her mother. Later she learned to make crafts out of crafters foam, wood, porcelain and using  other media and she decided to start selling. The pilot project was successful but she didn't have enough capital to fill the orders she received so she sought out Fundacion Mario Santo Domingo (Kiva Field Partner) for their support. She accessed her first loan in the amount of 1.200.000 COP and with it she purchased a variety of products, including clothing, shoes and ladies' accessories. She had enough money to purchase materials to make her beautiful crafts.  \r\nThis is how she managed to supplement her working capital and to make herself independent from her mother. \r\n\r\nThanks to her business she has been able to cover the house hold expenses and her children's education costs; she was able to contribute with her husband to the family's support. This loan is the second she requests and with it she will purchase sheets of crafters' foam, sewing materials, shoes, paints, and clothing. She will endeavor to take advantage of the holiday season at the end of the year when the sales are the highest. Every family enjoys decorating their homes, in preparation for Christmas. Equally they prepare themselves for New Year's Day.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Erika Lindig, Kiva

She is 52, married to a surveyor, and they have 5 sons and daughters: Leonardo, 32 who is an engineer, Juan Carlos, 31 who is in information technology, Dulce Mar\u00eda, 30, who is in public relations, Israel, 26, who is an economist, and Rodolfo, 15, who is studying in the CBTIS of Ciudad Ayala.  Ver\u00f3nica finished basic education and studied to be an executive secretary.  She will use her loan to supply her business. She is going to buy patented pharmaceuticals.  She began with KIVA loans and Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad through the invitation of a friend. She has a pharmacy in her neighborhood, and she also sells patented pharmaceuticals, perfumes, baby clothes and gifts.  Her business is called Farmacia (Pharmacy) Mega and she has had  it for 15 years.  Previously she worked in a pharmacy in Cuautla.  People who knew her suggested that she open a pharmacy in her area until finally, with the help of her sister, they established the first one.  Between the two of them they handled the business and then she helped her sister open one for herself.\r\nThey also had a restaurant in the area but they closed it because they couldn\u2019t find people who knew about the business.\r\nShe rents a store that is 200 meters from her house and every day she walks over to her business.  She considers her business very important because she gets to meet and talk with many people, it serves as a distraction, and she earns money.  What she most likes about it are the sales.  From the time she was little she sold from her mother\u2019s house.  It was a big lot and there were many fruit trees.  She would gather the fruit  from the trees in a basket and go out to sell, and then she would give the money that she made to her mother so that she would buy something delicious to eat.  When she was 14 she was buying soft drinks and selling them outside of her mother\u2019s house.  Later \u201cI went to Jalsico and began to buy blankets, sheets, cushions, and napkins that I could purchase very cheaply and I would make good money when I went to Zapata park in Cuautla  to sell the merchandise\u201c.  \r\nShe has always liked sales. She gets a lot of pleasure from her work because she can buy what she likes and she is proud to say that it has moved her sons and daughters ahead and helped them study for careers in the university.  Her regular customers are her own neighbors.  On the average she sees about 20 to 30 people  of all ages every day.  Her customers buy from her because they know she treats them well and that is why her business is known throughout the area.  Now there are two other pharmacies that have opened there  but they don\u2019t really affect her business.  She uses the money that she makes mostly in keeping up her medicine supply, to pay the rent, and to pay an employee. She will use the KIVA loan to buy patented pharmaceuticals and to purchase a showcase for the stuffed animals that she sells for gifts.  She has her plans and hopes to builf her own pharmacy so that she won\u2019t have to pay rent any more. The best will be that her youngest son continues studying and have a career.  She feels happy with the loan because it will supply her business.  Some of her words for the KIVA team are \u201cI appreciate that you help us with the loan to improve the business.  The town of Moyotepec likes it because the business started here and grew here. Moyotepec has a hot climate, they grow sugar cane, beans, onions, and corn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":681942,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pharmacy","sector":"Health","themes":null,"use":"To buy patented pharmaceuticals","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Moyotepec, Ayala, Morelos","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2011-01-04T02:40:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":500,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Veronica ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-12-16T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":6000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2011-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2011-01-27T08:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2011-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2011-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2011-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2011-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2011-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":750}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":187.5,"local_amount":2250,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T03:44:59Z","rounded_local_amount":2319.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191430790},{"amount":125,"local_amount":1500,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:44:43Z","rounded_local_amount":1546.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195850048},{"amount":125,"local_amount":1500,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:10:05Z","rounded_local_amount":1546.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201292321},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":750,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:08:47Z","rounded_local_amount":773.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206160586}],"funded_date":"2011-01-04T04:34:50Z","paid_date":"2011-05-15T11:08:47Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Miriam Palacio","image":693116}},{"id":266894,"name":"Rebeca Del Socorro","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Rebeca tiene muchas ganas de salir adelante con su familia.

When Sabah takes the loan, which will be repaid on a monthly basis, she will be able to pay for making repairs to her house and live in better conditions with her family. Sabah is a conservative religious woman, so her husband is photographed instead.

Now she is applying for a loan to repair her husband\u2019s vehicle so that he will be able to continue his work. <P>\r\n\r\nShe is joined in her loan by several more women from her locality. Rehana baji and Sakina baji each want a loan to buy an auto-rickshaw (a local three-wheeled motor vehicle). Khursheed baji wants a loan to pay the installments on her auto-rickshaw. Shamim baji wants a loan to buy a buffalo for her milk-selling business. <P>\r\n\r\nThis is a group loan. The loan funds will be distributed among the group members, each of whom will invest in her own business. The members mutually guarantee one another's loans. If one member does not repay, the other members are responsible.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":261534,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Transportation","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"To

Nasiba says that this is the perfect time for her to take out a loan. By offering a better selection, she knows she will be able to capitalize on this opportunity. \r\n\r\nHer goal is to continue expanding and improving her business every day, and more importantly, ensure that her four children will always be able to attend a good school.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n\t\r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous, and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment, forcing hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Using a part of this money, she invested in her business. But things didn't go well for her, and separating from her husband after having 3 children, she came to Barranquilla in 2006.  By 2008, having saved $1,300,000 Colombian pesos as capital, and with the help of Social Action, who provided seed capital of $1,400,00 pesos, she launched anew her little store in Barrio Concord, Municipality of Malambo. In 2009, she moved it to Barrio Las Moras, where things have gone very well for her store, the \u201cTienda la Luna\u201d.\r\n\r\nMaria wants to add a new show-case to her store, in order to begin selling miscellany. Also, she wishes to purchase cases of drinks, which are very profitable, especially on weekends and market days. She has approached the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation requesting a loan, since she already had  repaid this organization in a timely manner for 2 loans which were used for kitchen utensils (previously, she had made do with only the strictly necessary).\r\n\r\nMaria has 3 children, ages 12, 18, and 21, and lives in a rented house. But she dreams of having her own little house in the barrio where she has her market. She wishes to combine it with her miscellany store. \r\n\r\nLately she faces a great challenge which is not to sell at credit to everyone who requests it, but, rather, to select the customers she will finance very carefully, taking into account their capacity to pay. This will diminish the risk of losing what little money she has acquired through so much effort. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Harold Sims, Kiva

boy.  She has a secondary education and has been involved in agriculture for 12 years.  By nature, she is a woman with a very positive attitude.  She has four cows on her farm.  She and her children also grow barley on 1.4 hectares of their own land.  She also works as a cleaning lady in a school and she receives a pension for the loss of her husband.  The family's total monthly income amounts to 15,000 som (KGS), which is not enough for Nargul and her son to have a decent living.

Her store sells <i>kanga<\/i> and <i>vitenge,<\/i> which are traditional kinds of clothing worn by Tanzanian women. The <i>kanga<\/i> is a piece of printed cotton fabric, often with a border along all four sides. It is printed using the silkscreen method with its pattern in frames. <i>Kitenge<\/i> (the Swahili plural is <i>vitenge)<\/i> is a cotton fabric with wax print, printed by using rotary printing machines. <i>Kitenge<\/i> is a communicating textile: the various colors, patterns, writings and symbols represent moods, feelings, cultures, and traditions of native African people. \r\n<p>\r\nYuster works at her business eight hours a day, six days per week, and has one shop assistant.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets: thus, they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro-leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thereby enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":285309,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"To add more traditional African clothes.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mwanza","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.516667 32.9","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-03-09T21:20:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Yuster","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-03-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-04-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:23:56Z","rounded_local_amount":104160,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027605},{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-05-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:13:32Z","rounded_local_amount":104160,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613606},{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-06-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:01:33Z","rounded_local_amount":104160,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010685},{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-07-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:38:14Z","rounded_local_amount":104160,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63232971},{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-08-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:52:15Z","rounded_local_amount":104160,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73664762}],"funded_date":"2009-03-09T22:23:22Z","paid_date":"2009-09-15T21:52:15Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Maeve","image":1271729}},{"id":98089,"name":"Fati","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Cette dame habite le quartier d\u2019agbal\u00e9p\u00e9do, elle est divorc\u00e9e de son mari et a 02 enfants, elle est tr\u00e8s dynamique et travaille dure pour subvenir au besoin de ses enfants, l\u2019activit\u00e9 qu\u2019elle exerce est la vente de chaussures, de pagnes, de sacs et de m\u00e8ches.
