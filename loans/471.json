Shamsudin is an entrepreneur from Kumsangir, Southern Tajikistan. He runs a small business selling men\u2019s clothing and shoes in one of the local markets. He started his business ten years ago. His business is characterized by stable expansion and profitability. Shamsudin is the only breadwinner in the family. He has to put much effort in this business to make it sustainable and profitable.\r\n\r\nShamsudin would like to receive a loan of $3000 to increase his inventory. Shamsudin has promptly repaid all loans from IMON International. We believe his integrity, responsibility and strong will can help him succeed and to repay the current loan without any problems. \r\n\r\n \r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

This way of working allows her to generate resources to support her family since she\u2019s married and has five children.\r\n\r\nWhen asked what she likes about Pro Mujer, she answers that she likes the loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1700,"image":{"id":974014,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Catering","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy flour and sugar.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"La Paz \/ El Alto","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.483333 -68.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":59,"posted_date":"2012-01-05T20:00:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1700,"lender_count":55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Viviana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Catalina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alejandra","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Agustina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Julia Teresa\t\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Casimiro","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Agustina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-12-28T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":11500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":1700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":1916.63},{"due_date":"2012-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1916.63},{"due_date":"2012-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1916.63},{"due_date":"2012-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1916.63},{"due_date":"2012-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":1916.63},{"due_date":"2012-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1916.85}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":283.33},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":283.33},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":283.32},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":283.33},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":283.33},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":283.36}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":283.33,"local_amount":1916.63,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:52:52Z","rounded_local_amount":1943.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263418156},{"amount":283.33,"local_amount":1916.63,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T11:04:35Z","rounded_local_amount":1943.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270133034},{"amount":283.32,"local_amount":1916.63,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T11:15:09Z","rounded_local_amount":1943.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276749846},{"amount":283.33,"local_amount":1916.63,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:54:43Z","rounded_local_amount":1943.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283243330},{"amount":283.33,"local_amount":1916.63,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-24T08:15:09Z","rounded_local_amount":1943.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287516201},{"amount":283.36,"local_amount":1916.85,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:33:52Z","rounded_local_amount":1943.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294441149}],"funded_date":"2012-01-09T04:39:32Z","paid_date":"2012-08-15T10:33:52Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":382087,"name":"Gloria Narcisa","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Gloria Narcisa tiene 42 a\u00f1os de edad es viuda tiene tres hijos, vive con los hijos y los nietos en ventanas Provincia de los r\u00edos.\n\nEs integrante de la VRC LA UNION, se encuentra ubicada en el Recinto Aguas Fr\u00edas, Perteneciente al cant\u00f3n Ventanas, esta Ventanilla se dedica a labores Agr\u00edcolas de ciclo corto siembra de ma\u00edz, arroz, frejol.\n\nGloria se dedica a la agricultura a la siembra de ma\u00edz de ciclo corto.

This loan will go towards purchasing new equipment and more food to increase her production and lead her to greater profits, which will help her save up enough to one day purchase a prosthetic limb.\r\n\r\nNOTE: Clara and four other micro-entrepreneurs are part of a solidarity group designed by Esperanza to create a social network and accountability system. Clara and every other member in her group will receive an equal share of this $1,200 loan to develop their own businesses to support their families. They also provide ongoing advice for each other and help one another make payments on their loans. This group-lending method has proven to be a highly effective way to ensure accountability and support.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":26297,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Restaurant","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Purchase cooking utensils, additional pots and pans, meat and vegetables","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"DO","country":"Dominican Republic","town":"San Pedro de Macor\u00eds","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"19 -70.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":44,"posted_date":"2007-04-13T01:06:51Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Clara","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-04-27T09:18:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-05-27T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2007-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2007-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2007-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2007-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2007-10-27T07:00:00Z","amount":166.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2007-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2007-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":166.65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":167,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2007-05-27T09:17:55Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-28T20:05:49Z","rounded_local_amount":167,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":17756},{"amount":167,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2007-06-27T09:18:12Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-28T20:05:49Z","rounded_local_amount":167,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":26576},{"amount":167,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2007-07-27T09:21:14Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-28T20:05:49Z","rounded_local_amount":167,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36097},{"amount":167,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2007-08-27T09:23:17Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-28T20:05:49Z","rounded_local_amount":167,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":47129},{"amount":167,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2007-09-27T09:23:45Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-28T20:05:49Z","rounded_local_amount":167,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":59426},{"amount":165,"local_amount":165,"processed_date":"2007-10-27T09:25:52Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-28T20:05:49Z","rounded_local_amount":165,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":72797}],"funded_date":"2007-04-13T09:18:00Z","paid_date":"2007-10-27T09:25:52Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":12453,"name":"Patricia Guadalupe","description":{"languages":["es"],"texts":{"es":"\u201cI have had my business for 1 year, but there are many things I need.

To bare the responsibility not only as a mother, but also as a father is a very heavy burden. Nyoman Putri Widiani husband died of sickness. To fulfill household needs, every day Nyoman Putri Widiani works as a building laborer. Besides that Nyoman Putri Widiani  also raised 1 fattening pig as savings for her children, since those 2 are now in Grade school. The capital to buy feed and feedstock is obtained from Dinari for Rp 1,700,000 (about US$200). Capital spending to buy feedstock was Rp 300,000 (about $35), the rest to buy animal feed and additional household expenses.  Until harvest Rp600,000 (about $70) was spent, including feed. Gross income was Rp 1,200,000 (abot $140), nett  Rp600,000 (about $70). From that she likes to raise 3 more fattening pigs.  Her hope is to get the loan from Dinari could continue, so that her 2 children could go to higher education.\r\n<p><b>Translated from Bahasa Indonesia by Gwan Liong Ang, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\nNyoman Putri Widiani janda dengan 2 anaknya yang saat ini membutuhkan perhatian yang lebih banyak. Memikul 2 tanggung jawab dalam keluarga selain sebagai ibu juga harus bisa menjadi sosok seorang ayah sangatlah berat. Suami Nyoman Putri Widiani meninggal karena sakit. Untuk memenuhi kebutuhan rumah tangganya tiap hari Nyoman Putri widiani bekerja sebagai buruh bangunan. Selain memiliki kesibukan sebagai buruh Nyoman Putri widiani memelihara 1 babi penggemukan untuk tabungan anaknya karena 2 anaknya sekarang duduk di bangku SD. Modal yang didapat untuk membeli bibit dan pakan didapat dari Dinari sebesar Rp.1.700,000,-. Modal yang dikeluarkan untuk membeli bibit sebesar Rp.300,000,- sisanya untuk modal pakan juga untuk tambahan pengeluaran rumah tangganya. Modal yang dikeluarkan sampai panen sebesar Rp.600,000,- ini sudah terhitung dengan pakannya. Penghasilan kotornya sebesar Rp.1.200,000,-  jadi bersihnya Rp. 600,000,-. Dengan hasil yang di dapatnya ini Nyoman Putri Widiani ingin memelihara 3 babi penggemukan lagi. Harapan Nyoman Putri Widiani supaya pinjaman dari Dinari dapat berjalan terus supaya dapat menyekolahkan ke 2 anaknya kejenjang yang lebih tinggi."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":73537,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy pig feed & feedstock<p>Membeli pakan dan bibit babi","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Melaya, Bali","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":82,"posted_date":"2007-10-11T18:35:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":200,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ni Nyoman Putri Widi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-10-25T19:58:31Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":200,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2007-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2008-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2008-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2008-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2008-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":33.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2008-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":33.35}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":34,"local_amount":34,"processed_date":"2007-10-30T07:18:26Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-26T10:25:12Z","rounded_local_amount":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73638},{"amount":34,"local_amount":34,"processed_date":"2007-11-28T02:10:18Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-26T10:25:12Z","rounded_local_amount":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87760},{"amount":34,"local_amount":34,"processed_date":"2007-12-21T02:28:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-26T10:25:12Z","rounded_local_amount":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":100314},{"amount":34,"local_amount":34,"processed_date":"2008-01-21T07:35:46Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-26T10:25:12Z","rounded_local_amount":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":119117},{"amount":34,"local_amount":34,"processed_date":"2008-02-22T01:04:52Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-26T10:25:12Z","rounded_local_amount":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":139705},{"amount":30,"local_amount":30,"processed_date":"2008-03-26T06:05:16Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-26T10:25:12Z","rounded_local_amount":30,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166029}],"funded_date":"2007-10-11T19:58:31Z","paid_date":"2008-03-26T06:05:16Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":24742,"name":"Saumaleula","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Saumaleula is a married and the mother of two children.

They have three children who live with them in their home.  After they decided to get back together and for the wellbeing of their children, she and her spouse decided to sow a number of fields, leased for the most part, in addition to a banana plantation they own.  On the other lands, they sowed pineapple where the agreement with the landholders is that the profits will be equally shared, which allows them to pay for the family's basic needs.  They work together from 8:00 A.M. and during the entire day in the fields.

Zukhrakhon and her family need your support. \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She earns her living by operating two business ventures: dried fish vending and fish and salt vending. Her husband George, who is 38 years old, works as a carpenter\/laborer to earn his living and helps in his wife's business activities. They have three children who are 7 to 13 years old and are currently going to school.  Joy joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1997 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 15 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Joy has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 20,500 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 2,000, thus uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 16th loan, she is borrowing PHP 25,000 to use as additional capital for fish vending so that she can continue to save up for the future education of her children. Joy is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Luz Adriana siempre ha tenido el sue\u00f1o de poder impactar en la vida de las dem\u00e1s personas, y por esto quiere llegar a m\u00e1s personas con sus servicios de enfermer\u00eda, pues muchas veces requieren de sus servicios y por la dificultad de su desplazamiento no puede aceptar el trabajo. Es por esto que Luz Adriana aspira a comprar una moto para utilizarla como medio de transporte para su trabajo, sin embargo, la moto cuesta COP $3.000.000 y solo tiene COP $1.000.000; por esto, Luz Adriana espera que un pr\u00e9stamo le permita acceder al dinero que le hace falta para comprar la moto y poder as\u00ed seguir mejorando la calidad de vida de m\u00e1s personas que adquieren su servicio.","en":"Luz Adriana has always felt a calling to serve people, and for this reason she decided to study to become a nurse.  Previously, she worked for a company, but Luz Adriana didn't really like working for this company, because she did not feel that she was able to serve people as she would like.  In the company, they were more about making profit than serving people.  For this reason, she decided to leave this position and continue to work independently.  Now, Luz Adriana offers nursing services in people's homes, and in this way she feels that she can help more people.  Her customers state that her services are excellent compared to the services offered in the hospitals, and so they always seek out her services instead of going to the hospital.  Luz Adriana has always had the dream of being able to impact the lives of other people, and for this reason, she wants more people to be able to take advantage of her nursing services.  The problem is that many times people need her services, but because of their location she is not able to accept the work.  For this reason, Luz Adriana wants to buy a motorcycle to use to get around for her job.  However, the motorcycle costs 3,000,000 Colombian pesos, and she has only 1,000,000 pesos available for this purchase.  Therefore, Luz Adriana hopes that with a loan, she will have access to the money she lacks to buy the motorcycle, and in this way she will be able to continue to improve the quality of life of the people who need her services."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":985232,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Health","sector":"Health","themes":null,"use":"to

She detested this condition and she candidly explained how she would depend on her husband for entirely everything, including money to buy sanitary towels, which she hated. <p> One day in the year 2005 Anne borrowed Ksh 5000 (USD 75) from her husband to enable her to start selling cereals. Her husband was more than willing to give her the money, which she used to rent a stall in Ruai town. From the remainder, she bought stock of a variety of cereals, including beans, maize, green grams and rice. From here she started off her business, and it has been in operation ever since. Her business has continued to grow and has enabled Anne Muthoni to take her children to better schools. The income has enabled her to give her family a decent life. Her business also helped to restore her dignity, and she is therefore happy with herself. <p> Anne now intends to expand her business and is therefore making a request for a loan of $750. With the loan, Anne will purchase a weighing machine, sieving wire mesh, and a variety of cereals to stock her business. Some of the cereals she intends to purchase include a variety beans, maize, rice, flour, green peas, green grams and chicken feed. For Anne, this will translate into higher income, and she will be able to support her family, and particularly to meet her personal needs.

Nahuala is know for its winters, where heavy rain and thick clouds fall over the municipality.\r\n<p>\r\nThe Chuichijojche group has been working together for five years.  This creates a very special dynamic within the group, creates an environment of trust, and it also sees to it that the years don't pass in vain.  You notice this trust in the cheerfulness of the group at the repayment meetings.  This positive feeling which is abundant in this group is based in the most essential foundation - the responsibility.  This group has been able to stay together for such a long time because they are responsible women who pay on time.\r\n<p>\r\nAll of the group members sell traditional Guatemalan dresses.  They sell fabrics, long skirts, traditional hand-woven and embroidered blouses and hipbelts.  The women sell their goods at the main markets of the plain, such as Solola, Xela and Totonicap\u00e1n.  They already have regular buyers.  A few of them work as street traders or tend to clients in their homes.  The women not only have assigned buyers, but also have craftspeople who sew for them on demand.  Many of them also already have a group of craftswomen they buy from directly.\r\n<p>\r\nThe group members believe that the credit has supported them because they can purchase more typical clothing wholesale and thereby increase their profit.  They all think that without the loan they wouldn't be able to get ahead.  Because of this they are excited about breaking the taboo of coming together for a group loan.\r\n<p>\r\nThe biggest challenge facing this group of women is coping with both their businesses and also their domestic chores.  Many say that looking after their children and husbands and also keeping up with the housework is an additional job.\r\n<p>\r\nThe Chuichijojche group is a cheerful and united group.  They have already made a lot of progress over the last five years and it's because of this that we should support them so that they can continue fighting.\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from [Spanish] by [Lisa Ritchie], Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\n\r\nP>El reto m\u00e1s grande para este grupo de mujeres es el de lidiar con sus negocios y los quehaceres de la casa.

In the future, Nanumaya plans to uplift the economic condition of her family.  She thanks you for your support. <p>\r\n\r\nDairy cows are an important source of nutrition and income in Nepal.  Never raised for beef, their milk is used to make curd (duy) and fresh cheese (paneer).  Jersey cows are the preferred breed for milking.  On average, a dairy cow in Nepal will produce about 10 liters of milk daily, each liter selling in the local market for about USD $0.50.  In addition to producing milk, cows provide dung that is used in home construction, as fuel for fires, and can be captured in methane storage tanks.  The purchase of a dairy cow, made possible through a Kiva loan, is an investment that will repay itself many times over.  \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":802562,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Milk Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy a young milk-giving cow.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NP","country":"Nepal","town":"SainbuBhaishepati","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"28 84","type":"point"}},"partner_id":62,"posted_date":"2011-06-30T02:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nanumaya","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-06-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NPR","disbursal_amount":30000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2011-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2011-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2011-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2011-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2011-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2012-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2012-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2012-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2012-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2012-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2012-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":2500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.42},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.41},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.42},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.42},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.41},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.42},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.42},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.41},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.42},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.42},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.41},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.42}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":35.42,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T09:25:39Z","rounded_local_amount":2553.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221743317},{"amount":35.41,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-19T08:18:19Z","rounded_local_amount":2553.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227594779},{"amount":35.42,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-25T08:08:53Z","rounded_local_amount":2553.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":233265718},{"amount":35.42,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T11:18:17Z","rounded_local_amount":2553.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238691519},{"amount":35.41,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-21T09:09:21Z","rounded_local_amount":2553.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244647884},{"amount":35.42,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T11:14:36Z","rounded_local_amount":2553.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250865016},{"amount":35.42,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:43:40Z","rounded_local_amount":2553.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257275001},{"amount":35.41,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-30T07:55:26Z","rounded_local_amount":2553.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263416467},{"amount":35.42,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-24T08:11:01Z","rounded_local_amount":2553.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270131268},{"amount":106.25,"local_amount":7500,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-16T09:03:51Z","rounded_local_amount":7660.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276947072}],"funded_date":"2011-06-30T05:06:06Z","paid_date":"2012-05-16T09:03:51Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lorne Warwick","image":215175}},{"id":316522,"name":"Rot","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rot is 54 years old and married.

They live in their own house, with the basic necessities.  They have 3  children, two sons and one girl, all teenagers who study at the public school.  <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p> Alba has been the owner of a small general store for more than 5 years.  She sells items for every day use such as rice, oil, drinks, flour, etc.   She runs her business from her home, and her children help her.   Her husband has worked for the railroads for more than 20 years and has a monthly salary which helps cover the costs of taking care of and educating the children. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p> The motivation for requesting a loan is to be able to purchase more merchandise to stock the business, such as ciders, wines, beer, soft drinks, etc.  because the demand for these items is always high at the end of the year.  One of the projects Alba has for next year is to open another business, selling clothing, items for the home, office, gifts, etc.   There is currently no such shop in the neighborhood and her customers are requesting it. <\/p>\r\n\r\nDescripci\u00f3n:\tDESCRIPCION necesidad \r\n\r\nLa se\u00f1ora Alba M. de 35 a\u00f1os de edad, esta casada con el se\u00f1or Valent\u00edn C\u00e1ceres de 41 a\u00f1os, viven en casa propia, equipada con las necesidades b\u00e1sicas del hogar. Tienen tres hijos a\u00fan menores de edad, dos son varones y una mujer; todos ellos son adolescentes y est\u00e1n estudiando en colegios p\u00fablicos.<p>\r\n\r\nLa se\u00f1ora Alba es propietaria de una despensa con m\u00e1s de 5 a\u00f1os de antig\u00fcedad, vende art\u00edculos de primera necesidad como ser arroz, aceite, bebidas en general, harina, etc., su  negocio lo tiene en su propia casa, que es atendida por ella y por sus hijos. Su marido trabaja como empleado ferroviario hace m\u00e1s de 20 a\u00f1os y tiene un salario mensual, con la que ayuda a cubrir los gastos de alimentaci\u00f3n y la educaci\u00f3n de sus tres hijos. <p>\r\n\r\nEl motivo por el cual solicitan el cr\u00e9dito es para la compra de mercader\u00edas en oferta como ser: vinos, sidras, cervezas, golosinas, productos enlatados, etc. ya que en \u00e9pocas de fin de a\u00f1o la demanda de estos art\u00edculos es bastante alta. <p>\r\n\r\nUno de los proyectos de Alba para el pr\u00f3ximo a\u00f1o es la de abrir otro negocio, esta ser\u00e1 en el ramo de mercer\u00eda y bazar (venta de art\u00edculos varios como ropa, art\u00edculos para la casa, librer\u00eda, regalos, etc.). ya que   en el barrio no existe ning\u00fan comercio dedicado a esos rubros y sus propios clientes le solicitan este tipo de art\u00edculos.<p>\r\n\r\n<p> Translated by Kiva volunteer, Emily Charnes

Although she ran the store off and on for a while, it has been her only business since February 2002. Since then, she has dedicated herself full time to the store and to her parents. In fact, not only has Lourdes opened a second store in another neighbourhood, with her sister and neighbour helping her run it, she has also bought a photocopier and three computers to help turn the first store into a cyber cafe as well as a stationer's. Little by little, her business is growing. \r\nLourdes needs a loan of $12,000 pesos, which she will pay back in 10 installments, so that she can buy stationary to sell. She is short on capital at the moment. Because of the money she spent on the computers, she does not have enough left over for merchandise. \r\n. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Sara Sultan, Kiva

building materials for continued construction of his house. He liked Microinvest's loan conditions, and since he has a business he decided to request a loan for its development. Abdufatto is 51 years old, married, and has five children. His business is in the city's top restaurant, where he rents the bar. Two people work at the bar (the vendor is in the picture). Abdufatto hopes that the loan will allow him to further develop the business, and that he will be able to continue to receive loans in the future. \r\n\r\n  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Russian

The mash is placed in a non-water proof bag and allowed to ferment for one or two days, while weights are placed on the bag to press the water out. It is then sieved (or sifted) and roasted by heating in a bowl. The resulting dry granular garri can be stored for long periods. It may be pounded or ground to make a fine flour.

This bank is located in the city of Cuenca in the southern part of the country in the Sierro Centro region.\r\n\r\nRosario Q. is a member of the Damas Responsible Communal Bank.  She lives in the Catamarca sector in the city of Cuenca.  She is 69, married, and has six children.  She does not remember the ages of each one of them.  All of her children are married and living independently with their families.  She only lives with her husband, who is retired from the electric company, and a grandson.  Their house, which is their own, is the fruit of their mutual work in their youth.\r\n\r\nRosario works in agriculture, and she also raises animals.  She has been doing this for many years, and it supports her.  She has been working with her communal bank for three years.  She feels satisfaction for what she has achieved from buying seeds for her crops to paying the household expenses.  \r\n\r\nShe will use the loan she will receive from the ESPOIR Foundation to fix her house; she wants to put on a roof.  She will also buy corn, lima bean, and kidney bean, etc., seeds to increase her crops.\r\n\r\nHer dream is to have her health and her life to keep working with her crops and her animals.  She wants to keep increasing her business for her old age when she will not be able to work.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva

Sulaimon is 39 years old. He is married and is the father of 6 children. Sulaimon lives in Shahristan, Tajikistan. He grows and sells vegetables, such as potatoes, onions and carrots. Since the income generated by his work is always meager, he would like to use this loan from Kiva to buy seeds and mineral fertilizer to increase the productivity of his farm. This will allow him to earn a better return on his investment. The profits from his business will enable him to pay for household needs. Sulaimon and his family sincerely thank you for you support and encouragement. \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He is 37 years old and has worked for three years as a repairman.  He used to do the same job before but the hours were brutal and, worn out, he resigned.  With a payment that he then received, he bought supplies of clothes and cosmetics and began working as a street vendor, his sales being his sole source of income.  His wife has had three children, all now in elementary school, and what Armando most wants is to give them a good education.  He decided to go back to work as a repairman after some years because his sales were often too little to justify his hard work and the terrible hours he had to work before have improved.  \r\n\r\nHe will use this loan to improve his house.

Fredy lives with \u00c1ngela, 26, and they have two children.  They live in their own home made from flimsy materials. \r\n\r\nWith much effort, Fredy managed to turn his fields into green areas surrounded by lush trees and planted with cocoa bean, coffee and citrus fruits.

Today, he works his own lands.\r\n\r\nHis most profitable crop is the citrus fruits because he sells them at wholesale and retail at a very good price.  Thanks to profits earned he succeeded in setting up a grocery store where his wife, \u00c1ngela, works.  The months from June to August are the months when the greatest variety of planting takes place which is why Fredy has called upon the financial institution to negotiate a loan that will make it possible for him to plant more oranges and mandarins.

key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She sells used clothing, a business she has been involved with for the past 16 years and which earns her funds with which to help pay household expenses.  She began with her own savings as well as loans that have allowed her to maintain her sales.  This is her 8th cycle with Afodenic and she intends to use these funds to buy wholesale bales of used clothing as well as school uniforms since Nicaragua's national holiday is fast approaching and this is when parents traditionally purchase school uniforms.  She hopes to have her own store and thanks the institution for the growth attained to date which has allowed her to keep her client base and earn profits that have helped her meet her personal needs.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":374642,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Used Clothing","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"To purchase school uniforms and bales of used clothing.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Managua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.150833 -86.268333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":98,"posted_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:45Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosa Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-08-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2009-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2009-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2010-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2010-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2010-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2010-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2010-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2010-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2010-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2010-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2010-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.63}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.34},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.34},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.34},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.34},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":133.53,"local_amount":2670.53,"processed_date":"2009-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T10:53:21Z","rounded_local_amount":2733.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96875854},{"amount":33.14,"local_amount":662.81,"processed_date":"2009-11-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T10:44:50Z","rounded_local_amount":678.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103713774},{"amount":284.26,"local_amount":5685.24,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T10:58:14Z","rounded_local_amount":5819.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110601468},{"amount":148.13,"local_amount":2962.63,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T09:51:58Z","rounded_local_amount":3032.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118002922},{"amount":175.43,"local_amount":3508.6,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T07:52:51Z","rounded_local_amount":3591.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123841077},{"amount":225.51,"local_amount":4510.19,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T07:49:40Z","rounded_local_amount":4616.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128873987}],"funded_date":"2009-09-30T13:07:12Z","paid_date":"2010-04-15T07:49:40Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":135444,"name":"Help Yourself #2 Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Help Yourself #2 is a group of five borrowers who live in Kolahu, Lofa County, Liberia.

She is married to Antonio R. and both are blessed with two children. Born in the province of Masbate, a province just South of Manilas, he now lives in Dasmarinas, Cavite together with her family.\r\n\r\nRiza has been a regular member of the Center for Community Transformation* (CCT) for more than two years now. She regularly attends their weekly fellowship meetings and pays her weekly dues consistently. Because of her good repayment performance with her previous loans, she was able to borrow  seven times in the CCT\u2019s Cooperative.  The reason why she was consistent in paying her loans was because she used all most all the money she loaned to buy and sell various personal products and office supplies to her clients.\r\n\r\nNow with your help, she would like to apply for a PHP 18,000 loan. This amount will be mostly used as a source of added capital to her expanding business by buying additional stock and as payment for the monthly amortization of their motorized tricycle.\r\n\r\nShe dreams that her business will continue to grow so that when the time comes, they will have the resources to send their children to college. \r\n\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay Micro Finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":439375,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Products

Raul is a dedicated farmer. He plans to focus his efforts on the planting and harvesting of Cayenne and Habanero peppers. He works in cooperation with his family to strike a balance between accomplishing the daily tasks associated with agricultural production and the completion of domestic responsibilities. The land he works is his own. In addition to his agricultural activity, Raul feels it is important to be an active member of his community. As a result, he dedicates a significant portion of his time to community meetings, groups and events. The rural zone where Raul and his family live is sparsely populated with infrequent bus service and a general lack of infrastructure. Raul is working hard towards the sustenance of his family, striving to reap the maximum benefits from his land and his labor. \r\n\r\nAlthough this is an individual loan, the community in which Raul and his family live is very close-knit and interdependent. Neighbors help and support one another by sharing experiences and expertise acquired over the years. All individual members of the Upala community are dedicated to the improvement of living conditions for the region as a whole.\r\n\r\nThis loan will be used to finance the production of Cayenne and Habanero peppers. Specifically, the loan will be used to finance the purchase of a variety of necessary agricultural nutrients, fertilizers and chemicals in order to ensure a healthy harvest. All labor and logistical tasks associated with production will be carried out by Raul, with the help of his family members in the region of Upala. The production cycle (from planting to harvest) for these types of peppers is roughly one year. Raul planted his peppers four months ago and will expect to harvest in the next eight months. Typically, he dedicates the hours from 6:00 AM to 4:00 PM everyday to his agricultural activities. \r\n\r\nPiper and Capiscum Processors Compa\u00f1\u00eda Agr\u00edcola Industrial (PROPICA) is an international buyer and seller of chili pepper and ground pepper products. In cooperation with Fundaci\u00f3n Mujer, PROPICA has guaranteed to purchase the agricultural products (the peppers) that are to be produced with the help of this loan. PROPICA acts as a guaranteed client for small agricultural producers in the area of Upala, thus ensuring that their products will reach market. \r\n\r\nThe main obstacle Raul and other producers in the Upala community face is a lack of access to working capital funds. The collaboration of Fundaci\u00f3n Mujer and PROPICA represents a unique opportunity to Raul, his family and community. By offering a source of start-up capital and a guaranteed client to purchase what is produced, this is a chance to improve family and community standards of living. Above all, Raul wants to take advantage of the current opportunity that has been presented. He wants to profit from this collaboration and see improvements in his home and neighborhood. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":618248,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"For the purchase of agricultural nutrients and chemicals.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CR","country":"Costa Rica","town":"Upala","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"10 -84","type":"point"}},"partner_id":151,"posted_date":"2010-10-15T20:20:11Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":600,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Raul","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"CRC","disbursal_amount":300000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":98352.37},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":99991.58},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":101656.05}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":196.7},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":199.99},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":203.31}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":81.97,"local_amount":40984.2,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-28T09:20:46Z","rounded_local_amount":41697.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":196970540},{"amount":53.95,"local_amount":26973.7,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:06:09Z","rounded_local_amount":27443.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206158221},{"amount":464.08,"local_amount":232042.1,"processed_date":"2012-11-01T06:59:59Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-16T10:26:45Z","rounded_local_amount":236079.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315614327}],"funded_date":"2010-10-16T15:58:25Z","paid_date":"2012-11-16T10:26:45Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":242795,"name":"Shafiqullah","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Shafiqullah is son of F.

is a widow and 32 years old with 3 children.\r\n\r\nAnnie owns and operates a business venture, selling chips.  She has 2 years of experience in this business. Annie needs a loan of WST $1,000 to purchase raw ingredients needed to make products for sale.  She plans to use the profit from her loan to improve the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Annie joined SPBD to gain access to financial services.  Most of SPBD's clients are unable to borrow from commercial banks because they lack collateral.  This is Annie's 3rd loan with SPBD. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*SPBD evaluates the living conditions of each of its borrowers.  Generally, a loan manager evaluates a variety of social metrics on a scale out of 3 (the higher the number, the better off the person is) and these are averaged for the \"\"overall social metric score.\"\"  For example, a 3 out of 3 on \"\"level of education\"\" would mean that the borrower has graduated from university.  \r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem. Please join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD.

She is married and the mother of two children, one of whom is in school. She has been a local manufacturer of palm oil and palm kernel for five years. Palm oil is produced from palm nut fruits, and the palm kernel is a by-product of palm oil, which is produced first. The palm kernel is processed through various stages to obtain the palm kernel oil. \r\n\r\nGifty produces and supplies her product to food vendors, who use it to prepare their meals. She even treks to the villages to purchase the finished goods when demand is very high.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.
