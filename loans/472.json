She is married and has eight children.  They live together in Quimbiri, located in Cusco's beautiful woods, where they have their own house. The most relevant thing for Astria is \"creativity and perseverance\"--a maxim she applies to her agricultural work.  That's how she cultivates coffee, which is the source of her income. She is able to harvest a large amount of coffee, and her customers are happy with the quality of her product. She normally works alongside her family, and they work together well.  There is also the additional savings in expenses, since there is no need to hire outside workers. She usually sells her coffee in distribution centers in her area and at a competitive price. Her daily routine is to leave home at 7 am and return at 6 pm.  She only rests on Sunday, when she can be with her family.  Her plans for the future are to increase her agricultural production so as to build a house with good materials so that her family can be safer and more comfortable.\r\n\r\nThis is her six loan with microfinance partner MFP, and she promises to meet her payment schedule.  She also would like to thank her community bank, where everyone is responsible for paying their respective loans.  She will use this money to invest in buying supplies and fertilizer in order to adequately maintain her coffee plantation.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ross Forman, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":597955,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy provisions and fertilizer for her coffee plants","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"CUSCO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.518333 -71.978056","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-09-09T16:50:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Astria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-29T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":375}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":375,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:38:19Z","rounded_local_amount":1048.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201326960}],"funded_date":"2010-09-12T14:49:33Z","paid_date":"2011-04-15T11:38:19Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ross Forman","image":1172721}},{"id":234221,"name":"Mary Jean","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mary Jean M. is from the village of Palacapao, Quezon, Bukidnon.

He sells charcoal to the local people. He has been in this business for ten years now and has one employee. He says that the business is profitable. He says that his major challenge is financial constraints. However, he works very hard from early morning to late evening to keep his business doing well.

She is married with 2 children age 4 and 2 and has been in farming for 4 years. She fully relies on farming for her family upkeep. Her farm produces tea, milk and eggs.\r\n\r\nCherono has requested for a loan of 50,000 KES from Juhudi Kilimo to purchase a dairy cow.

He is 46 years old. Joel is the group leader of a 15-member group loan offered by ASKI, a Kiva partner. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nJoel is married and has three adult children. To make a living, Joel runs a general store. The main source of income for the business comes from selling daily-use products, such as shampoo, soap and toothpaste, in the local community. Joel has been engaged in his business for over five years and earns approximately 3,000 Philippine pesos a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Joel joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Joel is requesting a new loan of 7,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This will be the first loan taken out by Joel from ASKI. He plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay the tuition fees of his children. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful micro-finance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

She is 58 years old. Floria is the group leader of a 10-member group. While each member of the group receives an individual loan through ASKI, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is the Floria B. Group.\r\n\r\nFloria is married and has two adult children. To earn a living, Floria owns and operates a general store. While not the only means of generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from selling a variety of different products in the local community. Floria has been engaged in her business for over 30 years and earns approximately 2,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2006, Floria joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business. Floria has successfully repaid a previous loan of 25,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Floria is requesting a new loan of 20,000 PHP which will be used to purchase new items to expand product offering. This  will be the eleventh loan taken out by Floria through ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue it generates to improve and expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva and edited by a human editor. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

Together they live in the town of Quimbiri, located in the beautiful tropical jungle of Cusco, where they have their own house made of wood. In spite of having incomplete primary education, this was not an excuse to not continue with his dream to have his own business, and so he succeeded in cultivating and producing coffee. Now he has faithful buyers who always go to him for the high quality of this product. On the other hand, his ambition is to have an auto body shop, so he can obtain the necessary income to cover the basic needs of his family. It is because of this that he needs to work to generate the necessary capital to put into practice the workshop that he wants to open. Normally, he has the help of his family, who assist with the extraction and selection of his agricultural product, which is sold in the collection centers of their town. This is his sixth loan with MFP, for which he promises to continue following his payment schedule. He is satisfied with his communal bank, because of the good advantages it offers him.

The institution helps her to improve not only her living conditions, but also the social aspects of her life, which is very useful to her and to her funeral homes\/services.\r\n\r\nEven at 59, her perseverance never fades. When her husband died, she is the one who managed the business and most of her time is spent on her business and with her children. Moreover, she is doing her best to improve her business in order to sustain their basic needs. Through her hardship, courage and industry, her three children have already finished their studies and presently they all have stable jobs. Though her children have their own jobs, she never stops dreaming for their future. She also wants her business to improve in order to help other people in the community by providing employment. She also plans to help her relatives, so that they will become successful someday.\r\n\r\nFor her next loan, Teresa is applying for PHP 35,000 which she will use as additional capital for her funeral services business. She would like to have a bigger capital base because there are times when she has costumers who can\u2019t afford to buy a coffin in cash, and since she is very considerate she let's her costumers pay for the items in installments. Therefore, a rolling capital will make this more feasible. \r\n\r\nTeresa is now more dignified and happy because there are institutions, like ASHI and its field partner KIVA, which trust and believe in her.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"deleted","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":647438,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"For

pleasant to help somebody\u2019s talent prosper and see the achieved results. Masimkan is one of those who developed her talent thanks to this loan.\r\n\r\nMasimkan T., 54, is a leader of this group. She is divorced and lives with a young grandson. For last ten years she\u2019s been doing a small business by offering sewing services. In the beginning she was offering just small services in repairing of clothes. Later she applied for her first loan from Kiva through its Kyrgyz partner, Mol Bulak Finance. It really helped her to promote her business and to realize her new ideas. She brought new innovations into her clothing industry. Step by step she transferred to designing national clothing and to set her level of qualification higher. Soon she tended to have permanent customers ordering new designs on a regular basis. \r\n\r\nWith her second loan from Kiva, Masimkan plans to purchase new high-quality fabrics and to design new styles of outfits. Every month she gets income of 7,000 soms, which she spends on daily needs for herself and her grandson. A portion of her profit is reinvested back into the business and the rest is saved. Masimkan was very happy when she saved enough to purchase home electronics and to send her son to Russia to find a permanent job. For Masimkan, this is a second loan offered by Kiva, so she is sure she\u2019ll do her best to repay the loan on time, according to the schedule.\r\n\r\n      --- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance (MBF), a young, ambitious and socially-focused Microfinance Institution in Kyrgyzstan. \r\nMBF is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development and upholds the triple bottom line \u2013 People (building human capital and taking care of its customers as well as society), Planet (keeping environmentally friendly) and Profit (earning revenue to expand autonomously).

a strong and successful entrepreneur and can be the basis for one to glide over business adversity and periods of burnout. \r\n\r\nThe self-starting Jane set the ball rolling in her general merchandise retail trade three years ago in Kihihi in Western Uganda. Retail businesses are highly profitable this side of the country and many people involved in them have been able to improve their circumstances and their families' standards of living.\r\n\r\nFor Jane, a happy-go-lucky mother of three, this has principally unfolded because she has established strong working relationships with a variety of people, mostly her customers, over the years.\r\n\r\nShe has also been good at making pivotal decisions and organizing her finances, all aimed at strengthening her business. \r\n\r\nAt her shop she sells a variety of general merchandise retail items such as sugar, salt, jerrycans, rice, beans, cooking oil, eggs, etc.\r\n\r\nHer strong business notwithstanding, her achievements and strides have been afflicted by inevitable cost issues, lack of sufficient stock when demand is high and envy.\r\n \r\nShe has weathered most of those storms rather successfully and she anticipates that better horizons will open up in the not-so-far future. This, she believes, will happen if she does not rest on her laurels.\r\n\r\nWeekly, her gross sales profits are to the tune of UGX 300,000, and she says the purpose of this Kiva loan is to aid her in the purchase of more high-demand retail commodities such as maize flour, cooking oil, sugar, bread, rice and beans to resell.\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":820699,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to purchase more commodities such as maize flour, cooking oil, sugar, bread, rice and beans to resell.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Kihihi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"2 33","type":"point"}},"partner_id":84,"posted_date":"2011-07-25T14:20:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jane","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-06-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":1000000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":76923.08},{"due_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","amount":76923.08},{"due_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","amount":76923.08},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76923.08},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76923.08},{"due_date":"2011-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":76923.08},{"due_date":"2012-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":76923.08},{"due_date":"2012-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":76923.08},{"due_date":"2012-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":76923.08},{"due_date":"2012-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":76923.08},{"due_date":"2012-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":76923.08},{"due_date":"2012-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":76923.08},{"due_date":"2012-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":76923.04}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.77},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.77},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.77},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.77},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.77},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.77},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.76},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.77},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.77},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.77},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.77},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.77},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.77}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":400,"local_amount":1000000,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-17T08:01:12Z","rounded_local_amount":1034000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":222022810}],"funded_date":"2011-07-31T04:22:19Z","paid_date":"2011-08-17T08:01:12Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"kathleen melymuka","image":985313}},{"id":324397,"name":"Adita Mariana","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"En la ciudad de Portoviejo, capital de Manab\u00ed conocida desde hace muchos a\u00f1os  como la ciudad de los reales tamarindos, se re\u00fanen cada quince d\u00edas  las socias del Banco Comunal Mujeres 13 De Septiembre.\n\nEn este lugar vive la se\u00f1ora Adita, tiene 48 a\u00f1os de edad, est\u00e1 divorciada pero de esa relaci\u00f3n tiene seis  hijos, cuatro de ellos  mayores de edad y dos de 17 y 14 a\u00f1os que estudian en colegio, cinco de sus hijos aun viven en su casa.

When Fida'ee takes the loan, which is repaid on a monthly basis, he will purchase the repair kit for the taxi to fix things when needed and to pay for licensing and insuring the taxi so it will be legal. Fida'ee will work extra hours to increase his income and live with his family in better conditions.

When she was a child her parents taught him everything related to agriculture.\nShe lives in the rich highlands of Kapsowar with her husband and 5 children. Naum has been practicing farming for the past 7 years and, through those years, she has been able to support her family. Her primary sources of income are eggs, milk, and crop farming.\n\nThe Kapsowar area is populated and has a ready market for poultry products. However, Nahum's biggest challenge is lack of funds, which is why she is kindly seeking a loan to buy poultry. \n\nPoultry farming is one of the profitable business ventures in Kapsowar and you don\u2019t need to be a large scale farmer or have so many poultry birds to benefit from it. Through the loan, Naum will be able to sell eggs, meat and poultry feathers to the already existing market.

All of the members of the Centro Agricola de Baba Communal Bank are part of an Association of Rice Farmers in the county of Baba in rural Ecuador. Their association works cooperatively to cultivate rice and commercialize the product after it has grown. As an association, Centro Agricola helps the farmers by providing access to machinery and training services. The farmers from Centro Agricola have received special instruction on financial responsibility and accounting from Codemicro, an organization that specializes in training programs geared towards the rural sector.  \r\n<\/p> \r\n<p>The members of Centro Agricola de Baba will use the micro-loans to prepare their lands and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each others' guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the Centro Agricola de Baba Association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many micro-finance programs, but Mifex believes that is imperative for the communities we works with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties. <\/p> \r\n<p><em>Below is more information about Santa Lucia compiled by Luis Crespo and Robert Edgar of the Mifex team when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. <\/em><\/p> \r\n<h4>Economy of Baba<\/h4> \r\n<p>The people of Baba have been organized since the days of Gran Colombia when Ecuador was yet to be a country. The area has always been popular because of the extremely productive lands that gave way to cultivation of cacao for decades. Now Baba is a county in the province of Los Rios in the coastal region of Ecuador. For most of the latter part of the 20th Century it was a cacao and banana producing sector. Most of the surrounding areas of Baba in Los Rios are owned by large mulitnational  \r\ncompanies such as Dole, but Baba is a sector characterized by the small and informal farms. <\/p>\r\n<p>Rice production has now turned into the main economic activity of the sector as about 80% of the people are rice farmers. Cacao is still very popular in the area, but because of the long cultivation cycle people prefer to invest in rice. The lands in Baba are very fertile though, and most farmers in the sector often grow other crops, such as plantains and soy beans  \r\nas secondary sources of income.  Many farmers also keep livestock as emergency sources of food and income, commonly resorting to selling a chicken or pig if they are in need of cash. <\/p> \r\n<h4>Rice Farming in Santa Lucia<\/h4> \r\n<p>Most of the people in the Baba area are small farmers. They produce about 80 sacks of rice per hectare of land. In order to farm they first must prepare the lands by removing weeds, plowing and leveling the lands. This is the most difficult part for the farmers in Baba, who often lack the necessary machinery to properly plow the lands for rice production. After appropriately preparing the lands, the farmers fill an area with water to form what is known as a paddy field, because rice is a very water intensive crop. The rice seeds are either dispersed freely (the process is known as boleo in Spanish) or hand sowed. Once the rice has grown, most farmers rent machinery that helps them gather their production. <\/p> \r\n<h4>Access to Credit<\/h4> \r\n<p>One of the biggest struggles in the area has been the lack of credit due to the absence of any type of financial institution. \r\nBecause people do not count on formal financial finance, they have turned to loan sharks for financing. They have been affected by expensive lines of credit that exceed 100% interest a year and can be as expensive as 240%. Intermediaries also exploit the farmers because of their outstanding debt. Farmers also lack skills and knowledge to commercialize their products and pay fair prices for their crops. <\/p> \r\n<h4>Risks<\/h4> \r\n<p>The largest risk in the sector is due to absence of watering systems. Although Baba is in the province \u201cLos Rios\u201d (the rivers) there is severe problem with access to water. The lack of infrastructure in the sector does not allow the small farmers to benefit from the presence of the many rivers in the area. If the winter season is too dry, it is likely that the lands will not be sufficiently fertile for rice production in the summer. On the other hand, if there is too much rain there are not any drainage systems to prevent flooding and the crops are often ruined. Generally speaking though, Baba is a very productive sector where the lands yield all types of crops including rice, cacao, corn, watermelons, plantains, and soy beans. <\/p> \r\n<h4>Loan Use<\/h4> \r\n<p>The loans in this sector will mostly be used to to buy soil, seeds, fertilizer and insecticides. Many clients will use the capital towards renting machinery and equipment necessary to effectively work and prepare the fields. Clients also typically use a part of the loan to buy livestock in order to raise and have as reserves. The loan repayment schedule is different from the typical micro-entrepreneur because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures. Mifex asks our rural clients only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 6 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the seventh and final month. <\/p>\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":25841,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Rice Farming","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Baba","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-1.783333 -79.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":7,"posted_date":"2007-04-12T06:16:40Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":625,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Guido","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-04-26T19:49:44Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":625,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":104.17},{"due_date":"2007-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":104.17},{"due_date":"2007-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":104.17},{"due_date":"2007-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":104.17},{"due_date":"2007-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":104.17},{"due_date":"2007-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":104.15}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":104.17},{"due_date":"2007-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":104.17},{"due_date":"2007-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":104.17},{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":104.17},{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":104.17},{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":104.15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":105,"local_amount":105,"processed_date":"2007-06-08T09:15:34Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T22:05:53Z","rounded_local_amount":105,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":21415},{"amount":54,"local_amount":54,"processed_date":"2007-08-22T17:55:08Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T22:05:53Z","rounded_local_amount":54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":45284},{"amount":54,"local_amount":54,"processed_date":"2007-09-07T19:28:04Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T22:05:53Z","rounded_local_amount":54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":51896},{"amount":471,"local_amount":471,"processed_date":"2008-01-03T21:54:37Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T22:05:53Z","rounded_local_amount":471,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":107761}],"funded_date":"2007-04-12T19:49:44Z","paid_date":"2008-01-03T21:54:37Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":12161,"name":"Osman","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"I.

Dalam menekuni usahanya Putu tergabung di kelompok ternak babi Kembang Mekar. Pinjaman pertama ke DINARI memberi pengaruh yang sangat bagus untuk perkembangan usaha ternak babinya. Untuk jangka waktu pemeliharaan 5 bulan Putu Yeni bisa mendapat keuntungan sampai Rp.500.000,-. Karena itulah Putu Yeni melanjutkan kerja sama dengan DINARI melalui pinjaman yang kedua. Pinjaman berjangka waktu 6 bukan ini akan digunakannya untuk menambah populasi ternak babinya dengan membeli 3 ekor bibit penggemukan disamping induk babi yang sudah dimilikinya. Dan sisa dari pembelian bibit akan digunakan untuk membeli pakan ternak. Diharapkan dengan bertambahnya jumlah peliharaan serta pinjaman yang semakin meningkat maka bisa dimanfaatkan untuk membeli pakan yang lebih berkualitas sehingga akan menghasilkan panen yang lebih baik dari sebelumnya dan pada akhir periode nanti bisa mengembalikan pinjaman dari DINARI.

She wants to achieve all this with much effort and constant work.\r\nNarcisa raises pigs and sells the pork on foot.  Her operation is at her house.  She has had this business for twelve years.  She got involved in the business because this type of business was already in her family.  She has stuck with it because it is not too difficult, but she had trouble attracting customers because she has a lot of competition, and all the people in this type of business already had their own customers.  This is why, in the beginning, she decided to go out into the streets to try to sell her meat and nacatamales (a special Latin American tamale).  The different customers she gained were from other places.  They began coming to her house to buy nacatamales, fried foods, and charrascas.  These customers made her business known, and her neighbors came by her house and bought more that they liked.  Now she is requesting a loan to increase her working capital, since she has to look for pigs and travel here and there to get them at the best price and make the most of her business.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Hannah Lily, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":261811,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Working capital","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Leon","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.435556 -86.879444","type":"point"}},"partner_id":96,"posted_date":"2009-01-30T03:00:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":275,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Narcisa Del Socorro","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-09T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":5500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2009-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2009-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2009-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2009-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2009-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2009-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2009-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2009-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2009-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2009-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":25,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2009-02-09T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T08:40:19Z","rounded_local_amount":503.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20400013},{"amount":25,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2009-03-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T18:35:09Z","rounded_local_amount":503.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27092011},{"amount":25,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2009-04-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T16:37:28Z","rounded_local_amount":503.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35985394},{"amount":25,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2009-05-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T23:08:53Z","rounded_local_amount":503.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44446009},{"amount":25,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2009-06-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T20:39:05Z","rounded_local_amount":503.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52956650},{"amount":25,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2009-07-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T13:58:21Z","rounded_local_amount":503.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63174075},{"amount":25,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2009-08-08T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T15:27:11Z","rounded_local_amount":503.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73599697},{"amount":25,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2009-09-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T17:51:15Z","rounded_local_amount":503.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87035589},{"amount":25,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2009-10-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T21:35:59Z","rounded_local_amount":503.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96947998},{"amount":25,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2009-11-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T12:31:31Z","rounded_local_amount":503.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103789971},{"amount":25,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2009-12-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T13:31:25Z","rounded_local_amount":503.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110680669}],"funded_date":"2009-01-30T03:48:45Z","paid_date":"2010-01-15T13:31:25Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":90009,"name":"Gladys","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Gladys tiene 41 a\u00f1os, vive con su esposo y sus tres hijos en la casa que adquirieron hace tres a\u00f1os.

She and her family have a shoe factory where they make beautiful leather shoes, selling them wholesale to a number of retailers. They manufacture large quantities of shoes, especially during the school year, when they make shoes and send them to other provinces where they sell at higher prices. Within the production process, Gladys is in charge of sales and takes products to the capital to distribute them and, if she has the opportunity, even to sell them to individuals. She enjoys the work and does it every Friday and Saturday, which are very good days for business. The rest of the week, she takes care of running the factory and managing the staff, since her education in administration helps her in that area. She hopes eventually to improve her marketing, and is submitting paperwork to negotiate with governmental bodies that have requested large quantities of merchandise for the poorest schools in the country. She would like to be part of that project. Gladys is one of MFP's oldest clients, and this is her seventh loan. She tells us that her time working with our institution has helped her improve her factory and her interpersonal relations.

She is 40 years old. Mariefe is married and has four school-aged children. \r\n\r\nTo make a living, Mariefe owns and operates a business running a sari-sari (variety) retail shop. The main source of income for the business comes from selling both food and daily use products in the local community. Mariefe has been engaged in her business for over five years and earns approximately 5,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Mariefe joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Mariefe has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional products to sell. \r\n\r\nMariefe is requesting a new loan of 8,000 PHP, which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This loan will be the 2nd loan taken out by Mariefe from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\nNote: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

With it she\u2019s managed to educate her children who help their mother also selling hayacas [a type of tamale], cakes and snacks for special events and family get-togethers.\r\n\r\nIn addition to this business she also sells merchandise that she brings from Sampu\u00e9s, a town in Sucre Department in Colombia, to sell in Barranquilla and in Soledad in Atl\u00e1ntico Department.  Her growth dream does not stop and this is why she\u2019s been associated with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo for 14 years.  She\u2019s had 9 loans that have helped her grow as a person and to develop in her business and with this she\u2019s increased her family\u2019s quality of life especially with respect to her living spaces and her children\u2019s education.\r\n\r\nShe is currently planning to access a Kiva loan to buy ingredients for her food preparation and furniture from Sampu\u00e9s for the great end of year sales, a season when merchandise turns over more because of increased customer demand who pay good payments to buy new things for their homes.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":939965,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to

lives on his farm with his wife and four children. He still has three children who are in school. He supports his family with the income from rice farming on his small, but productive farm. With the loan he receives, he hopes that he can buy machinery that will help him prepare the land he works on. His biggest goal is to be able to buy land of his own because he currently rents the land, and the farm he works on. He hopes he can acquire his own property to hand down to his children one day. \r\n<\/p>\r\n<h4>Communal Banking in Baba<\/h4> \r\n\r\n<p>This borrower is part of the newest and largest Communal Bank in the recently developed Mifex Rural Finance Program. All of the members of the Centro Agricola de Baba Communal Bank are part of an Association of Rice Farmers in the county of Baba in rural Ecuador. Their association works cooperatively to cultivate rice and commercialize the product after it has grown. As an association, Centro Agricola helps the farmers by providing access to machinery and training services. The farmers from Centro Agricola have received special instruction on financial responsibility and accounting from Codemicro, an organization that specializes in training programs geared towards the rural sector.  \r\n\r\n<\/p> \r\n\r\n<p>The members of Centro Agricola de Baba will use the micro-loans to prepare their lands and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each others' guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the Centro Agricola de Baba Association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many micro-finance programs, but Mifex believes that is imperative for the communities we works with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties. <\/p> \r\n\r\n<p><em>Below is more information about Santa Lucia compiled by Luis Crespo and Robert Edgar of the Mifex team when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. <\/em><\/p> \r\n\r\n<h4>Economy of Baba<\/h4> \r\n\r\n<p>The people of Baba have been organized since the days of Gran Colombia when Ecuador was yet to be a country. The area has always been popular because of the extremely productive lands that gave way to cultivation of cacao for decades. Now Baba is a county in the province of Los Rios in the coastal region of Ecuador. For most of the latter part of the 20th Century it was a cacao and banana-producing sector. Most of the surrounding areas of Baba in Los Rios are owned by large multinational companies such as Dole, but Baba is a sector characterized by small and informal farms. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rice production has now turned into the main economic activity of the sector as about 80% of the people are rice farmers. Cacao is still very popular in the area, but because of the long cultivation cycle people prefer to invest in rice. The lands in Baba are very fertile though, and most farmers in the sector often grow other crops, such as plantains and soybeans as secondary sources of income.  Many farmers also keep livestock as emergency sources of food and income, commonly resorting to selling a chicken or pig if they are in need of cash. <\/p> \r\n\r\n<h4>Rice Farming in Santa Lucia<\/h4> \r\n\r\n<p>Most of the people in the Baba area are small farmers. They produce about 80 sacks of rice per hectare of land. In order to farm they first must prepare the lands by removing weeds, plowing and leveling the lands. This is the most difficult part for the farmers in Baba, who often lack the necessary machinery to properly plow the lands for rice production. After appropriately preparing the lands, the farmers fill an area with water to form what is known as a paddy field, because rice is a very water-intensive crop. The rice seeds are either dispersed freely (the process is known as boleo in Spanish) or hand sowed. Once the rice has grown, most farmers rent machinery that helps them gather their production. <\/p> \r\n\r\n<h4>Access to Credit<\/h4> \r\n\r\n<p>One of the biggest struggles in the area has been the lack of credit due to the absence of any type of financial institution. \r\n\r\nBecause people do not count on formal financial finance, they have turned to loan sharks for financing. They have been affected by expensive lines of credit that exceed 100% interest a year and can be as expensive as 240%. Intermediaries also exploit the farmers because of their outstanding debt. Farmers also lack skills and knowledge to commercialize their products and pay fair prices for their crops. <\/p> \r\n\r\n<h4>Risks<\/h4> \r\n\r\n<p>The largest risk in the sector is due to absence of watering systems. Although Baba is in the province \u201cLos Rios\u201d (the rivers) there is severe problem with access to water. The lack of infrastructure in the sector does not allow the small farmers to benefit from the presence of the many rivers in the area. If the winter season is too dry, it is likely that the lands will not be sufficiently fertile for rice production in the summer. On the other hand, if there is too much rain, there are not any drainage systems to prevent flooding and the crops are often ruined. Generally speaking though, Baba is a very productive sector where the lands yield all types of crops including rice, cacao, corn, watermelons, plantains, and soybeans. <\/p> \r\n\r\n<h4>Loan Use<\/h4> \r\n\r\n<p>The loans in this sector will mostly be used to buy soil, seeds, fertilizer and insecticides. Many clients will use the capital towards renting machinery and equipment necessary to effectively work and prepare the fields. Clients also typically use a part of the loan to buy livestock in order to raise and have as reserves. The loan repayment schedule is different from the typical micro-entrepreneur because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures. Mifex asks our rural clients only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 6 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the seventh and final month.

Y. lives in Shahrinav. He works as a private taxi driver. He has his own car.  He lives with his family. He is married and has 5 children. He is 28 years old, and it is not easy to support such a big family. Therefore, he must work very much so that his family does not want for anything. Recently, his car had a serious breakdown, and now major repairs are necessary.

The organization is devoted to the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through microfinance as a practical way to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women. Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets; because of this, they are deemed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support, hence poor access to basic needs and services. When a client needs working capital to buy a specific item, SELFINA buys the equipment for said client and extends a loan to her. The same equipment is then leased back to the client so they can use it while in process of paying back their loan, a process called a sale-and-leaseback arrangement. Once the loan has been repaid, SELFINA transfers the ownership of the equipment to the client. The advantage of microleasing over traditional microfinance loans is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":192574,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To purchase crops in bulk","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbeya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.9 33.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-08-30T19:10:34Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":450,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Barubina N.","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-09-13T20:44:44Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2008-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2008-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":90},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":90},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":90},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":90},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":90}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":90,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2008-10-11T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-21T07:17:52Z","rounded_local_amount":104220,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356205},{"amount":90,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2008-11-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T04:18:40Z","rounded_local_amount":104220,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5347947},{"amount":90,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2008-12-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:09:07Z","rounded_local_amount":104220,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9970521},{"amount":90,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-01-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:13:33Z","rounded_local_amount":104220,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14886738},{"amount":90,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-02-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:02:35Z","rounded_local_amount":104220,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20435998}],"funded_date":"2008-08-30T20:44:44Z","paid_date":"2009-03-16T21:02:35Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":65437,"name":"Thi Mai's Group","description":{"languages":["vi","en"],"texts":{"vi":"C\u00f4 L\u00ea Thi\u0323 Mai 48 tu\u00f4\u0309i, ma\u0303 s\u00f4\u0301 tha\u0300nh vi\u00ean 06030006 c\u00f4 la\u0300 ng\u01b0\u01a1\u0300i phu\u0323 n\u01b0\u0303 r\u00e2\u0301t chi\u0323u kho\u0301.

Flaviana is married to a farmer. To make a living, Flaviana owns and operates a sari-sari (general) store. Flaviana has been engaged in her business for over 10 years and earns approximately 6,000 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Flaviana joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Flaviana has successfully repaid a previous loan from PMPC. Flaviana is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional inventory and provide working capital. This loan will be the 6th loan taken out by Flaviana from PMPC.

With the help of her past 18 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Virginia has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 25,000 Philippine pesos (PHP) helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 10,000, uplifting the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 19th loan cycle, she is borrowing PHP 25,000, which she intends to use as additional capital for her dried fish business so that she can continue to save up for the future for the education of her children. Virginia P. is a Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means \"honorable\") woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\n<b>About NWTF:<\/b> In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon.

Usaha yang dijalani saat ini adalah berjualan rujak. Setiap pagi, dengan diantar suaminya menggunakan sepeda motor, dia harus pergi ke Pasar Badung untuk belanja kebutuhan untuk membuat rujak, seperti bumbu, buah-buahan, dan kacang. Jarak antara rumahnya dan Pasar Badung tidak terlalu jauh, sehingga dia tidak terlalu menyita waktu suaminya yang bekerja sebagai buruh bangunan. Tempat dia berjualan rujak adalah di depan rumahnya. Pembelinya adalah kebanyakan orang sekitar dan juga orang luar yang sudah sering beli rujak ditempatnya. Penghasilannya cukup untuk membayar sewa kontrak tanah yang sekarang ditempatinya bersama suaminya dan ketiga orang anaknya. Dia berharap diberi bantuan pinjaman untuk dijadikan tambahan modal usaha."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":125,"image":{"id":161689,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To add working capital (Menambah Modal Usaha)","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Badung","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.5 115.333333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":82,"posted_date":"2008-05-22T12:50:11Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":125,"lender_count":1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sariyati","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-06-05T12:56:09Z","disbursal_currency":"IDR","disbursal_amount":1000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2008-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2008-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2008-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2008-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2008-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":12.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":13,"local_amount":104000,"processed_date":"2008-06-22T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T02:42:18Z","rounded_local_amount":121082.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":245527},{"amount":13,"local_amount":104000,"processed_date":"2008-07-22T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T02:43:09Z","rounded_local_amount":121082.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":273991},{"amount":13,"local_amount":104000,"processed_date":"2008-08-22T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T02:44:08Z","rounded_local_amount":121082.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":303491},{"amount":13,"local_amount":104000,"processed_date":"2008-09-22T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-09-29T07:22:34Z","rounded_local_amount":121082.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":334315},{"amount":10.5,"local_amount":84000,"processed_date":"2008-11-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-16T02:43:32Z","rounded_local_amount":97797.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5308452},{"amount":12.5,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2008-12-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-22T08:55:09Z","rounded_local_amount":116425.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9925405},{"amount":12.5,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-01-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T11:41:18Z","rounded_local_amount":116425.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14849703},{"amount":12.5,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-02-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-18T08:03:23Z","rounded_local_amount":116425.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20389163},{"amount":12.5,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-03-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T17:45:00Z","rounded_local_amount":116425.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27080569},{"amount":12.5,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-04-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T15:21:27Z","rounded_local_amount":116425.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35973795}],"funded_date":"2008-05-22T12:56:09Z","paid_date":"2009-05-15T15:21:27Z","journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":53158,"name":"Alima","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Alima A. is fifty years old. She is married and has three children, all of whom are currently in school. For twenty years now (and counting), she has been a local manufacturer of palm oil and palm kernel oil, which are used to prepare many local dishes. For clarity, she notes that palm oil is produced from palm nuts whereas palm kernel oil is produced from palm kernel and that palm kernel oil is a by-product of palm oil. Normally, she alternates production between the two products: that is, after producing palm oil, she automatically obtains the raw materials to produce palm kernel oil, and so on.

The organization is devoted to the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through microfinance as a practical way to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women. Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets; because of this, they are deemed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support, hence poor access to basic needs and services. When a client needs working capital to buy a specific item, SELFINA buys the equipment for said client and extends a loan to her. The same equipment is then leased back to the client so they can use it while in process of paying back their loan, a process called a sale-and-leaseback arrangement. Once the loan has been repaid, SELFINA transfers the ownership of the equipment to the client. The advantage of microleasing over traditional microfinance loans is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":192593,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To purchase rice in bulk","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbeya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.9 33.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-08-30T18:40:40Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":450,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Tutindaga N.","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-09-13T19:44:48Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2008-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2008-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":90},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":90},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":90},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":90},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":90}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":90,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2008-10-11T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-21T07:17:55Z","rounded_local_amount":104220,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356214},{"amount":90,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2008-11-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T04:18:46Z","rounded_local_amount":104220,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5347956},{"amount":90,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2008-12-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:09:07Z","rounded_local_amount":104220,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9970530},{"amount":90,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-01-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:13:34Z","rounded_local_amount":104220,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14886747},{"amount":90,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-02-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:02:24Z","rounded_local_amount":104220,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20436007}],"funded_date":"2008-08-30T19:44:48Z","paid_date":"2009-03-16T21:02:24Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":65453,"name":"Rukhsora","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"G.

She is married and has 8 school-aged children. To make a living, Rebecca owns and operates a business venture in the retail sector running a sari-sari (variety) retail shop. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling a variety of different products in the local community. Rebecca has been engaged in her business for over 1 year and earns ~3,000 PHP a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Rebecca joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Rebecca has successfully repaid a previous loan of 11,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used as additional business capital. Rebecca is requesting a new loan of 13000 PHP to purchase additional products to sell. This will be her fourth loan from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement her family\u2019s income.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

They live in the Pueblo Joven Jos\u00e9 Olaya, which is located in the city of Chiclayo.\r\n\r\nShe has been making clothes for 15 years.  She makes articles of clothing for women, men, and children.  She takes various orders from the city.  This activity is the only source of income for her family.  He husband is in charge of delivering the clothing that she makes.\r\n\r\nRosa has gotten ahead in her business with the support of the Institution.  She started with a small amount of money and her first loan, which she used to buy a sewing machine.  From then on she has continued working with much effort to earn her sustenance.  She built her house, and she now plans to give her two children, ages 18 and 15, a college education.\r\n\r\nRosa\u2019s work is very good and original.  There is much demand for the clothing she makes.  That is why she has seen the necessity of asking the Institution for a new loan for 1,500 PEN.  She will use the loan to buy fabric and thread to continue making her customers\u2019 orders.\r\n\r\nDuring the three years that Rosa has been working with the Institution, she has demonstrated punctuality and responsibility with her payments.  Therefore, she is considered to be an excellent client.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":374108,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Tailoring","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"Buy fabric and thread to make clothes","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"P.J.

While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is Imelda C.'s Group.\r\n\r\nImelda is married and has two school-aged children. To make a living, Imelda raises crops. The main source of income for her business comes from planting and harvesting  a variety of vegetables for sale. Imelda has been engaged in her business for over 21 years and earns approximately 8,500 Philippine pesos a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Imelda joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Imelda has successfully repaid a previous loan of 7,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase fertilizers, such as manure. Imelda is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional seeds, seedlings and young crops to raise. This will be the second loan taken out by Imelda from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\n<b>About ASKI:<\/b>\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

B., 30, is an industrial engineer with a microbusiness called Alusso Leather.  Owning her own business has been a dream for Adriana since she was 6 years old.

She will use the supplies to make products for the upcoming holiday season.  Adriana plans to position herself in the local market within six months, a real challenge because she faces a lot of competition.  However, her designs are attractive to buyers and she expects her sales to take off over the coming holidays.  \r\n  \r\nAdriana is an entrepreneurial young woman and focused on building her business.  She has always known that she wanted to be an entrepreneur and now she's fulfilling her dream.

She started by making bags and gradually added footwear, taking advantage of the experience of her parents and other members of her family who could show her the way.  She has skill and she believes that will help her make a success of the business quickly.  Adriana is committed to making high-quality products because she ultimately wants to establish a position in the national market.

Needless to say, most people residing in these areas live below the poverty line. Sylvia was once part of that group.

They have three children who are between 3 and 12 years old. Mary Ann joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2008 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past four loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Mary Ann has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 14,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 2,000, uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her fifth loan, she is borrowing PHP 18,000 to use as additional working capital so that she could continue to save up for her children's future education. Mary Ann is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

It is the kind of place local people usually send their children running to fetch something when they are in the middle of cooking the evening meal and don't have time to go all the way to the market to buy the missing ingredient."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":192612,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To buy soap, sugar, tomatoes, etc. for re-sale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbeya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.9 33.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-08-20T23:20:16Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":275,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Junes N.","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-09-04T13:46:07Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":300000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":60000},{"due_date":"2008-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":60000},{"due_date":"2008-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":60000},{"due_date":"2009-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":60000},{"due_date":"2009-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":60000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":55}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":55,"local_amount":60000,"processed_date":"2008-10-04T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-15T07:16:36Z","rounded_local_amount":63690,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347892},{"amount":55,"local_amount":60000,"processed_date":"2008-11-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T04:18:48Z","rounded_local_amount":63690,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5347963},{"amount":55,"local_amount":60000,"processed_date":"2008-12-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:07:09Z","rounded_local_amount":63690,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9970537},{"amount":55,"local_amount":60000,"processed_date":"2009-01-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:12:01Z","rounded_local_amount":63690,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14886754},{"amount":55,"local_amount":60000,"processed_date":"2009-02-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:01:31Z","rounded_local_amount":63690,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20436014}],"funded_date":"2008-08-21T13:46:07Z","paid_date":"2009-03-16T21:01:31Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":65469,"name":"Chu Thi","description":{"languages":["vi","en"],"texts":{"vi":"Mrs. Chu Thi T. is 50 years old.

For the last 20 years she has worked in this craft which she learned as a child. She made her hobby her profession, since she has always enjoyed sewing. The hardest part for her is to obtain material to use to create her products, since the price can be quite high. Nevertheless, she works hard every day.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

She runs a firewood and palm oil business. Pauline lives and sells her products in Bamenda, Cameroon, near GHAPE. She will use her loan to purchase firewood, palm oil, rice, corn and beans to resell at her store on Foncha Street. \r\n \r\nThis is Pauline\u2019s seventh loan from GHAPE since she became a beneficiary in 2001. She has had her business for long enough to know that she will be successful with this loan. She sees that her customers, that is, her community, benefit from her business because they do not need to travel as far to have access to firewood and her food products. She also sells her products at moderate prices, so she believes she is competitive.\r\n\r\nShe has used profits from previous loansto buy items for her business\u2019s kitchen, essentially investing in her business. With this loan, she hopes to use the profits to pay for her children\u2019s school fees and their books. Pauline prefers GHAPE loans because they allow long-term loans and that has helped her be able to invest in her business.\r\n\r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon.  GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach.  Every client is trained in business management, basic health, life skills, financial management, profits and losses, and family values.  Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement.  GHAPE instills a sense of family and community within its clients and staff and has developed a strong bond of trust between the organization and its clients.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1175,"image":{"id":285742,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fuel\/Firewood","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Purchase firewood and vegetables for resale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CM","country":"Cameroon","town":"Foncha St, Nkwen, NW.

Adem\u00e1s, cuenta con el apoyo de sus suegros, que le brindan sus tierras a sin ning\u00fan costo, por ello que sus metas a corto plazo son de comprar sus propias chacras de cultivo y un terreno donde pueda construir su casa.

","en":"Jencen, 21, lives with his partner with whom he has a son.  For now, they're living with her parents.  He's had a thorough understanding of farm life from the time he was a boy because his parents are farmers.  Proudly, happily, he turns over the top layer of soil in his fields so that he can later fertilize them and ensure a good crop when the harvest rolls around.  Afterwards, he'll sell the crop in the markets in the city or, perhaps, he's thinking, sell right from the field to avoid the transportation costs.  Jecen is proud to be a farmer.  It's his only work and, for the most part, it's been a profitable business.  He counts on support from his in-laws who provide land to him at no cost.  Jencen's short-term goal is to buy his own farm and land where he can build a house.  To reach his goal, he's starting at the bottom.  He says that the goal is difficult but not impossible.  The money that he's applying to borrow is for chemical fertilizers to fertilize the potato fields that he seeded 3 days ago.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jere Wiseman, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":314415,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Buy fertilizers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-05-09T00:20:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":675,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jencen","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-04-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":675}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":675,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T15:24:15Z","rounded_local_amount":2028.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110733828}],"funded_date":"2009-05-11T15:05:41Z","paid_date":"2010-01-15T15:24:16Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jere Wiseman","image":30736}},{"id":110537,"name":"Leonida","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Leonida P. lives in Buenavista, Pagadian City, Zamboanga Del Sur.

He lives with his wife and their children in a large traditional family in Wayerma I, one of the residential neighborhoods in Sikasso (third administrative region of the Republic of Mali).\r\nAfter havng tried a variety of different activities without success, three years ago Mr. Kon\u00e9 started his business of buying and selling white damask fabric, caustic soda, dyes, etc. He carries out this activity at Wayerma I, across from the Malian Agency for Press and Advertising  (AMAP) in Sikasso, not far from the central prison, where he has a shop. Mr. Kon\u00e9 is very much sought after by his customers because of the quality of his products. Mindful of meeting the needs of his ever growing number of customers, he joined micro-finance institution Soro Yiriwaso more than two years ago. He is on his third individual loan, his previous loans all having been properly repaid. This new loan will allow him to buy 20 packets of caustic soda, 17 pieces of damask, 13 bags of potash, 15 boxes of dye in different colors, etc. He gets his supplies in Bamako (the capital of Mali) and sells to a clientele made up mostly of women who dye fabric and who are from the town of Sikasso and the surrounding area. With this new loan he expects to make a monthly profit of 200,000 CFA francs which will mainly be used to contribute towards household expenses and pay interest on the loan, the rest being invested in his business.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Sarah  Puchner, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":950,"image":{"id":558471,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"To buy various articles","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sikasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.316667 -5.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:37Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":950,"lender_count":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Dramane","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-06-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":950,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2011-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2011-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2011-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2011-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2011-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":95},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":95},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":95},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":95},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":95,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:58:25Z","rounded_local_amount":50661.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166913677},{"amount":95,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:41:20Z","rounded_local_amount":50661.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172180808},{"amount":95,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T16:14:29Z","rounded_local_amount":50661.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177476777},{"amount":95,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:40:08Z","rounded_local_amount":50661.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182613490},{"amount":95,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T14:43:00Z","rounded_local_amount":50661.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188751918},{"amount":95,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2011-01-17T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-17T00:57:13Z","rounded_local_amount":50661.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191606163},{"amount":95,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2011-02-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T12:20:15Z","rounded_local_amount":50661.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195917794},{"amount":95,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2011-03-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T12:12:57Z","rounded_local_amount":50661.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201360740},{"amount":95,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2011-04-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:48:39Z","rounded_local_amount":50661.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206226111},{"amount":95,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2011-05-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T12:00:23Z","rounded_local_amount":50661.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211301049}],"funded_date":"2010-07-08T16:59:34Z","paid_date":"2011-06-15T12:00:23Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sarah Puchner","image":669957}},{"id":213816,"name":"Demetrio","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El Se\u00f1or Demetrio H.

M. is forty one years old, single and has two children aged twenty two years old and nineteen years old whom she hopes to give a quality university education. Her business is located at Choka, near a very busy highway in Nairobi. She sells timber, twisted bars, galvanised iron pipes, paints, nails, water pipes, taps, cement, iron sheets, bolts and other items to local builders. Most of her customers are loyal repeat customers and walk-ins. \r\n\r\nShe has been in this business for the last nine months and she says the business is profitable. She says that the business is very good and the only major challenge she has is slow moving stock as potential customers do not purchase building materials since they fear to build because of land ownership issues. However, she works very hard from early morning to late evening to ensure that her business is doing well. She is taking a loan of  50,000 Kenyan shillings (KES) to replenish her stock of iron sheets, water pipes and nails. In future she sees herself build her own business premise in which she will be serving thousands of customers.
