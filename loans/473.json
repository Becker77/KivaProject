She needed more capital to be able to expand and to continue with the business now that she did not lack for clients.  A friend invited her to the \"Union and Work\" Communal Bank, to which she now belongs.  \r\n<p>\r\nWith the recent loan of 500 soles which will be paid off in 4 months, she will buy articles for her business such as 1 bag of rice, 1 bag of sugar, kilograms of stew, oil and meat for the preparation of dishes.  \r\n<p>\r\nSe\u00f1ora  Sara Alvina is 44 years old and has 2 children of which 1 is still is in her care.

She comes back to DINARI to increase her working capital to farm more pigs.  This second loan will be used to purchase piglets, feeds and medicines.

Disamping sebagai petani, Wayan W. juga menggeluti usaha beternak babi di rumahnya. Setiap pagi dan sore harinya Wayan W. selalu rajin memberi makan serta memandikan babi-babinya untuk dapat menghasilkan panen babi yang bermutu baik. Modal yang dibutuhkan sebagai peternak babi sekitar Rp.1.300.000,- untuk memelihara 4 ekor babi dan sisanya dipakai untuk membeli pakan babi. Keuntungan yang diperoleh perbulannya sekitar Rp.200.000,-. Karena itulah Wayan kembali meminjam ke DINARI untuk menambah modal usaha sehingga babi peliharaannya bisa bertambah banyak. Pinjaman kedua ini digunakan untuk membeli bibit babi serta sisanya untuk pakan dan obat-obatnya. Melihat hasil dari beternak babi ini sangat bagus untuk menghidupi keluarga bersama dengan suaminya maka Wayan sangat serius untuk menekuninya. Wayan berharap pemeliharaan kedepan selama 6 bulan akan memberikan keuntungan yang melebihi sebelumnya."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":193586,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Purchase piglets, feeds and medications","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Melaya, Bali","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":82,"posted_date":"2008-08-30T18:10:35Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":175,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ni Wayan","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-09-13T19:17:14Z","disbursal_currency":"IDR","disbursal_amount":1500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2008-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2008-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2009-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2009-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2009-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":250000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":29.15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":58.33,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2008-11-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-19T20:05:11Z","rounded_local_amount":539505.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5308544},{"amount":58.33,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2009-01-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T11:41:45Z","rounded_local_amount":539505.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14849767},{"amount":58.34,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2009-03-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T17:45:26Z","rounded_local_amount":539505.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27080604}],"funded_date":"2008-08-30T19:17:14Z","paid_date":"2009-04-15T17:45:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":65873,"name":"Kalsoom","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Kalsoom baji is married and lives in Kasur, Pakistan.

Her goal is to be able to maintain her business and thereby be able to continue providing her own income and not be dependent upon her domestic partner.  She very much wants to be able to convert her small store into a local eatery.  Here she would make her clients feel as much at home as at a business.  Her dream is to be able to have her own home given that she now lives with her mother.  She wants to keep her family together, to be able to help her elderly mother as much as possible, and to keep growing her clientele.  Her business actually consists of sales of soup, fast foods, beer and soft drinks.  She has dedicated herself to her business for seven years.  She started in the business as a way to generate her own income, and like all women with a fighting spirit, put her business ideas into practice.

A. Aubierge traces her roots to the historic city of ABOMEY, in Zou County.  Aubierge is a photographer and video-reporter by training.  Because she lacks the financial means for buying cameras, so as to practice her profession, she got started in commerce.\r\n<p>\r\nAubierge is married to Mr. DJIHOKIN Basile, a motorbike mechanic by training.  She is the mother of two girls and a boy who are all in school.  Her family lives in a rental in Hlacomey, an outlying district of the city of COTONOU, where her business of 15 years has been in selling various goods (soaps; rice in sacks of 5-, 10-, and 20-kg; evaporated milk, canned tomatoes; peanut oil; detergents; toilet paper; boxes of sugar; pasta such as spaghetti, school supplies, etc.) \r\n<p>\r\nFour years ago now, she opened a telephone center in Tokpa, the international marketplace of BENIN, where she sells recharge phone cards of all the telephone networks in B\u00e9nin.  She has four phones allowing market-goers to make and receive phone calls.  Aubierge herself is the one who takes care of the telecenter at the Tokpa marketplace. \r\n<p>\r\nBack at the house, she has the help of a sister of hers in selling various goods.  Aubierge has five people to support, which means she spends 3,000 francs CFA on average for food per day for her family. \r\n<p>\r\nShe envisions creating another display of goods next to her telecenter at the Tokpa marketplace.

She is a wife and mother of three children who are currently in school. She has operated a clothing shop for the past six years and sells jeans, cloth, blouses, skirts, women slippers, dressing bags and headscarves. She is currently constrained with funds to operate the business as a result of a business expansion. She needs the loan to enable her to inject more working capital and scale up her business.

She is starting a business venture, planting & harvesting taro for sale.  Nuuao needs a loan of WST $1500 to purchase weed-killers such as Gramoxome.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 300 tala or US $125 per week) to make improvements to her house.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Nuuao joined SPBD.  This is her 2nd loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Nuuao's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Nuuao M. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.99 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.99 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         2 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/www.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

She started working together  with her mother, and she later went to Asunci\u00f3n in search of better opportunities. During her time there, she was able to advance her education by studying clothing design and creation. She later returned to her native city to start her own business as a professional clothing designer and creator. \r\nShe currently works out of her home, and she has a solid base of customers who greatly admire her work. She creates clothing of all types, including suits, bridal gowns and trousers for men and women.  \r\nShe would like to provide an additional service to her customers: opening a fabric store to provide her clients with more choices. She is requesting the loan for this purpose, and also because she has received an order from a factory in Ybycui for employee uniforms, as well as orders for uniforms for students in some of the city's schools. \r\nRosa is grateful to the Paraguaya Foundation for the help provided through the loan, and she assures us that she will work hard with a great desire to continue making progress.

Diana Mar\u00eda M. is a resident and has her business here, where she dedicates herself to making fried foods and lunches.  She has 5 children ages 12 to 27, is separated and currently still cares for her two younger children.  She makes her living through her business.\r\n\r\nThis is her first loan through the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation.  She plans to invest the funds into the purchase of a cover for her hot dog vending cart.  She will invest the rest into buying basic ingredients in bulk, such as rice, cooking oil, and flour.\r\n\r\nWhen she was 13 years old, Diana Mar\u00eda started working as a domestic, an activity she carried out until she turned 40.  At that point, she decided to make a childhood dream a reality:  to have her own business.  This is how she got started selling fried foods such as patacones (fried plantains) from the front porch of her home.  She later expanded her business by adding papas rellenas (stuffed potatoes) of beef, chicken or mixed, cakes, and lunches.  This activity that has gone a long way in sustaining the family, especially the two youngest children that she still supports.  She has triumphed through her own effort and work ethic, given the lack of support from their father.\r\n\r\nHer biggest dreams are to own a house and to expand her business with a greater variety of fast foods.  Currently, her greatest challenges are to see her older children become independent and to outfit her enterprise to meet the neighborhood\u2019s demands.  So, when she had to replace her wood stove with a gas one, she was able to work and serve her neighbors more comfortably.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Mary Lynn Malaby, Kiva

She is in the photograph with her group members. This  group joined One Acre Fund in the year 2011 and will re-enroll in the 2012 program.\r\n\r\nJanet takes care of six children at home. She joined One Acre Fund in order to access fertilizer and hybrid seeds and ensure food security for her family. In the recent 2011 season, Janet had an excellent maize yield harvesting 12 bags on 1\/2 acre of land. Before joining One Acre Fund, Janet was only able to harvest 1 bag of maize on 1\/2 acre of land.

M. lives in Vakhdat. Abdullo is 68 years old and is married with 3 children. He has been working in retail for the past twenty years. Abdullo owns a food store, which is located next to his house. As Abdullo's store is located in a remote village. As Abdullo's store gives people an opportunity to buy food without leaving the village, there is high demand for the food he sells. The prices in his store are fair and even low.  Abdullo wants to increase his store's assortment, and in order to be able to do so, he would like to build new shelves. Therefore he is appying for a loan that he plans to repay within 12 months. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Russian by Oksana Buranbaeva, Kiva

She is married and the mother of two kids who are currently in school. She lives in Bekwai, Zongo community with her husband. Her husband works with the local council in the community. Zongo in Ghana is a place which is dominated by Muslims.\r\n\r\nShe is a local manufacturer of palm kernel oil. Palm kernel oil is produced from palm kernels. The palm kernel is a by-product of palm oil. The palm kernel is processed through various stages to obtain the palm kernel oil, which is used to prepare many local dishes like frying fish, local soaps and pastries. She produces and supplies to food vendors to prepare their meals. However, her production is on the low side as a result of low working capital to afford a machine for the processing. She wants to use the loan to buy more bags of palm kernel and an electric milling machine to reduce the drudgery of using manual labour to help produce larger quantities.

L. is 35 and married with 1 child (6 years-old).  She owns a business venture, providing general  alteration & tailoring services to local community members.  Paese has 7 years of experience in this business.  Paese needs a loan of WST $2000 to purchase additional fabrics & materials.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 250 tala or US $104 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\n\nIn 2008, Paese joined SPBD.    This is her 3rd loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Paese's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\n\nThe following social metrics for Paese L. are provided by SPBD*:\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.5 out of 3\nLevel of Education:                              1.5 out of 3\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.22 out of 3\nQuality of Household Assets:              1.56 out of 3\n\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\n\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/www.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\n\nAbout SPBD\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\n\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

The only thing she has to do is walk quite a lot.\r\n\r\nIn the future, Mar\u00eda plans to build her own home on the plot of land that her in-laws gave her.  In this way, she hopes to continue making progress.\r\n\r\nThis is Mar\u00eda's 11th loan with MFP and she knows that the loan she needs will be very useful in making progress in her business.  She is a very responsible member of her community bank, for this reason she is very well respected by her fellow group members.  Mar\u00eda plans to invest her money in buying a larger quantity of casual clothes such as pants, jeans, shoes and sneakers.  In this way she hopes to fill her pending orders and make more profits."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":686500,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"To buy clothes and sneakers to stock her business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-01-06T15:20:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":650,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-12-13T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1800,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":266.09},{"due_date":"2011-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":276.12},{"due_date":"2011-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":297.08},{"due_date":"2011-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":306.61},{"due_date":"2011-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":320.41},{"due_date":"2011-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":333.69}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":96.09},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":99.71},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":107.28},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110.72},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":115.7},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":96.09,"local_amount":266.09,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T04:39:46Z","rounded_local_amount":269.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191463748},{"amount":99.71,"local_amount":276.12,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T08:51:38Z","rounded_local_amount":279.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195887136},{"amount":107.28,"local_amount":297.08,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:38:06Z","rounded_local_amount":300.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201327497},{"amount":110.72,"local_amount":306.61,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:31:30Z","rounded_local_amount":310.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206196043},{"amount":115.7,"local_amount":320.41,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:42:18Z","rounded_local_amount":324.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211269726},{"amount":120.5,"local_amount":333.69,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:33:26Z","rounded_local_amount":337.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216549732}],"funded_date":"2011-01-16T08:16:24Z","paid_date":"2011-07-15T11:33:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Oxnard","image":null}},{"id":267506,"name":"Evenor David","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El se\u00f1or Evenor David R.

It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, five pesos 'worth of cooking oil or an egg. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She makes a profit by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling them at retail piece rates. She earns a minimum of 200 Philippine pesos (PHP) in sales every day. \r\n\r\nTo help her continue operation of her variety store, she is requesting a 16,000 PHP loan. She plans to use this loan to buy more products like groceries, toiletries, and beverages so as to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nCherryl dreams of being able to give all of her children a good and high-quality education through all of her hard work in her business. She also prays that her business will become bigger and that she eventually will own a convenience store. As a CCT community partner, she faithfully attends the group's weekly fellowship meeting* where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies. \r\n\r\n*All CCT community members are organized into fellowship groups composed of 15 to 30 community partners that meet on a weekly basis. The fellowship groups gather to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance loans. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":754577,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to pay for additional grocery items for her variety store","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Bacoor, Cavite","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2011-04-21T17:00:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Cherryl","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-04-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":16000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1066.67},{"due_date":"2011-04-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1066.67},{"due_date":"2011-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1066.67},{"due_date":"2011-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":1066.67},{"due_date":"2011-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1066.67},{"due_date":"2011-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1066.67},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1066.67},{"due_date":"2011-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":1066.67},{"due_date":"2011-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1066.67},{"due_date":"2011-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1066.67},{"due_date":"2011-06-29T07:00:00Z","amount":1066.67},{"due_date":"2011-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1066.67},{"due_date":"2011-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1066.67},{"due_date":"2011-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1066.67},{"due_date":"2011-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1066.62}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":50,"local_amount":2133.34,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T10:33:45Z","rounded_local_amount":2169.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206123629},{"amount":100,"local_amount":4266.68,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T10:49:52Z","rounded_local_amount":4338.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211195029},{"amount":125,"local_amount":5333.35,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T10:43:10Z","rounded_local_amount":5423.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216474087},{"amount":100,"local_amount":4266.63,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:32:02Z","rounded_local_amount":4338.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221636868}],"funded_date":"2011-04-21T20:10:04Z","paid_date":"2011-08-15T08:32:02Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"David Walker","image":null}},{"id":296192,"name":"Anita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Anita D. is from the city of Molicay Ozamiz City.

We will buy these goods at a lower cost in the markets of the nearby towns of Potou and St. Louis, and resell then in our village.\u201d \r\n<p>\r\nBackground\r\n<p>\r\nSenegal is one of the world\u2019s poorest countries, yet its solid democratic tradition and highly developed associational life distinguish it from other countries in its income group. Especially remarkable are Senegal\u2019s networks of rotating savings and credit associations, known as tontines. Commonly organized by groups of twenty to thirty housewives who live in the same village, the tontines provide poor women throughout the country with small loans to finance modest income-generating activities. Repayment rates within these associations are excellent, because they are based on local reputation and personal trust between the members. However, their financial resources are limited to the contributions of their members, frequently subsistence farmers with very little disposable income. This has prevented the traditional tontines from meeting the demand for rural microenterprise loans and restricted their impact on the economic development of their communities. The SEM Fund works to bridge this gap by linking traditional village credit associations with outside sources of finance.\r\n<p><b> Business description translated from French by Senegal Ecovillage Microfinance Fund. <\/b>\r\n<p>\r\n\u00abLa population de Gandiol s\u2019estime \u00e0 environ 13.968 habitants.\r\nLes principales activit\u00e9s \u00e9conomiques qui sont men\u00e9es dans la zone sont : la p\u00eache, le mara\u00eechage, l\u2019\u00e9levage, et l\u2019extraction du sel.\r\nCependant du fait de la p\u00e9joration climatique et des ph\u00e9nom\u00e8nes anthropique, le niveau de d\u00e9gradation et de d\u00e9sorganisation est ressentis par sa communaut\u00e9 enti\u00e8re.

Because customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets, the women lack tangible collateral assets, and financial institutions do not consider them to be credit-worthy.

This is her 2nd loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Faamanuia's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Faamanuia F. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.7 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              1 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/www.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.

Niyoz has been dedicated to the activity of agriculture from a young age. He has attended to this activity with great strength. It is necessary to highlight that this gentleman is very involved in his work because he has an obligation to take care of his three children. The need that Niyoz is encountering now is that he doesn't have the financial capital to invest in the crops and for this reason, he applied to IMON International to obtain a loan of $1,000 USD to buy mineral fertilizer in order to prepare his land for the upcoming season. Niyoz promises to repay the loan without any violations and thanks everyone for supporting him.    \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

12 years old. Despite the limited opportunities she and her family have, which hampers them from rising above poverty, Nenita still feels blessed because of the love and support of her husband in all her endeavors, especially in business.\r\n\r\nIn 1999 Nenita and her husband agreed to request for a loan through ASHI to be able to put up a business for her husband to manage. Through its revenue, her family would have a source of cash flow to support their daily needs.\r\n\r\nNenita was able to purchase two motorcycles for a transportation business. One is a tricycle with a sidecar attached and is operated by her husband, and the other one is rented by someone in their village. Because this is one of the common means of transportation for people in the whole of the town, since jeepneys (small buses) and buses are rare and are not accessible in remote villages, Nenita\u2019s business has grown fairly well.\r\n\r\nNow, as a matter of fact, Nenita has able to start up her own small sari-sari (variety) store business using the profits from her prior business.\r\n\r\nWhile Nenita\u2019s children are still young, she wants to grow her own business through the loan she is now requesting. This loan will be used to increase the inventory of her store such as foodstuffs, beverages, and other basic commodities for people in their neighborhood to access rather than having to spend money on fares to go to market. \r\n\r\nNenita is hoping to be able to put up a savings fund for the sustainability of her businesses as well as for the education of her children in the future. She is looking forward to the day when she would be marching on stage together with her children for them to receive their medal and diploma for their graduation from college.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":533633,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery

He has already received three loans which have all been duly repaid.\r\n\r\nHe is seeking a fourth loan to buy fifteen cartons of various cigarettes, five bags of sugar, twelve boxes of tea, five packages of candy, nine packages of gum, twenty-five packages of matches, fifteen boxes of soap, etc. His merchandise is bought from wholesale sellers in the city to be sold retail in his shop. \r\n\r\nWith this loan he plans to make a monthly profit of 200,000 FCFA, which will primarily be used to help pay family expenses, pay interest on his loan, and invest in his business."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":783478,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"to buy a variety of products.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sikasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.316667 -5.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2011-06-03T04:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1100,"lender_count":36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lassina ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-05-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2011-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2011-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2012-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":125000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":275},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":275},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":275},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":275}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":275,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2011-07-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T09:30:31Z","rounded_local_amount":125109.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221750968},{"amount":275,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2011-09-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T10:13:31Z","rounded_local_amount":125109.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232882107},{"amount":275,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2011-11-19T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T11:12:38Z","rounded_local_amount":125109.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244655462},{"amount":275,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2012-01-19T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:48:18Z","rounded_local_amount":125109.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257283060}],"funded_date":"2011-06-07T22:11:37Z","paid_date":"2012-02-15T11:48:18Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Robin Clochard","image":830278}},{"id":308503,"name":"Elizabeth","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Elizabeth is 32 years old and lives in the Philippines.

The distribution of farming inputs is part of One Acre Fund\u2019s integrated agriculture package, which includes training, reliable input supply (such as fertilizer and seeds), credit and insurance.\r\nWith income from maize sales, George will educate his children, ensure food security and invest in livestock rearing.\r\nIn 2012, the members of Pamoja SHG Group will each plant between half and one acre of maize.\r\nIn the photo, George is pictured with his group members; the field officer is on the far left.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":914394,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to source farming inputs such as seeds and fertilizer at low prices for the 2012 planting season.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Chwele","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2011-11-13T20:30:15Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":725,"lender_count":29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Annah","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ben","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Benard","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Emmanuel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"George","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Grace","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jane","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Susy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-10-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":71750,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71750}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":725}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":725,"local_amount":71750,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-27T10:15:15Z","rounded_local_amount":72500,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315680540}],"funded_date":"2011-11-19T09:03:29Z","paid_date":"2012-11-27T10:15:15Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Paul & Rachel Norridge","image":828426}},{"id":353614,"name":"Alizhan","description":{"languages":["ru","en"],"texts":{"ru":"\u0410\u043b\u0438\u0436\u0430\u043d \u2013 \u0432\u0435\u0441\u0435\u043b\u044b\u0439, \u0434\u043e\u0431\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0443\u0448\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0438 \u0436\u0438\u0437\u043d\u0435\u0440\u0430\u0434\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0447\u0435\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0435\u043a. \u0415\u043c\u0443 42 \u0433\u043e\u0434\u0430,  \u0436\u0435\u043d\u0430\u0442,  \u043e\u0442\u0435\u0446 \u0442\u0440\u043e\u0438\u0445 \u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0439.  \u0410\u043b\u0438\u0436\u0430\u043d -

Today, BRAC has emerged as an independent, virtually self-financed paradigm in sustainable human development. It is one of the largest Southern development organizations employing over 100,000 people, 61% of which are women, and working with the twin objectives of poverty alleviation and empowerment of the poor. Diagnosing poverty in human terms and recognizing its multifaceted nature, BRAC approaches poverty alleviation with a holistic approach.\r\n<br><br>The successes of BRAC in the international development arena have stimulated a series of discussions, both with African delegations, who have visited BRAC programs, and with donors who work in Asia and Africa. Both the African countries and the donors have encouraged BRAC to join the development campaign in Africa to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and more recently to join the campaign of \u201cending poverty\u201d, which is an area where Africa represents the greatest global challenge.\r\n<br><br> In Uganda, BRAC registered as a Non Government Organization (NGO) in January 2006 to undertake programs in Education, Health, Water & Sanitation, Agriculture & Livestock and Microfinance. The Microfinance and Education are the pioneer programs launched in Uganda and, as of July 2007, had served 21,273 borrowers and enrolled 1,155 adolescents in its education

The organization is devoted to the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through microfinance as a practical way to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets; thus, they are deemed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and hence poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.

Cette fois-ci le pr\u00eat vas nous permettre de travailler sur une plus large \u00e9chelle et va impliquer plusieurs personnes( environs douze); Nous savons que nous pouvons compter sur Kiva car c'est le seul partenaire qui nous pr\u00eate de l'argent sans condition et vite fait.","en":"This will be the second loan that we have solicited from Kiva. The loan will be used to support activities that will generate revenue. We have in the past, received a loan that assisted us greatly and showed us how to manage a micro-loan. Now,we would like to make investments, along with hard work to produce for example; the dying of cloth and the sale of the finished product to the hotels and boutiques within the Ecovillage Fund group. With the profits made from our first loan we were able to satisfy the needs of our individual families ( school, health) as well as meet our responsibilities. This second loan will allow us to work on a larger scale and will involve several more persons (about twelve). We know that we can count on Kiva as they are a partner who can quickly lend funds without conditions.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by David Gibbons, Kiva

He is very happy and aware that he has to work hard to survive in life. He lives in his parents\u2019 house, and he wants to give them a good old age. Santiago drives a taxi. It doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s day or night; he continues traveling the streets in search of clients that want to arrive safely and soundly at their destination. He has a happy demeanor, and his conversational skills make his clients look for him to take them around. In addition, he knows the streets in the city of Puno well and always offers a fast service. What he likes most about his work is driving through the streets, since it passes the time. He has spent 10 years in this job, and what he likes least is to have to fight with some passengers that don\u2019t want to pay, even though they know this is his job and he has to do it. For the future, he hopes to buy another taxi and use it for work in order to improve his earnings. This is Santiago\u2019s first loan with MFP, and he is ready to pay all of her payments on time. He is a very responsible and supportive member of his community bank. With the 1000 soles that she requests, he will repair his taxi, which, over time, has been damaged. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Avni Shah, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":315663,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Taxi","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"To repair his taxi","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Puno","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15.833333 -70.033333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-05-08T20:40:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Santiago","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-04-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":165}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-05-08T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T00:54:55Z","rounded_local_amount":175.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44596215},{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-06-08T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:38:39Z","rounded_local_amount":175.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52990493},{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-07-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:39:59Z","rounded_local_amount":175.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63211604},{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-08-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:18:53Z","rounded_local_amount":175.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73641125},{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-09-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:31:13Z","rounded_local_amount":175.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87080565},{"amount":57.75,"local_amount":165,"processed_date":"2009-10-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T02:59:58Z","rounded_local_amount":172.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96996690}],"funded_date":"2009-05-16T09:58:39Z","paid_date":"2009-11-16T02:59:58Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Avni","image":null}},{"id":110989,"name":"Lolita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lolita L. is from the town of Lopez Jaena.

She trades in Dumas clothes, linen and lace materials. She mostly sells through hawking - a personal selling method that she says makes her goods move very fast. She is 46 years old and a married mother with three children. All her children are in school. She supports her family through the proceeds she makes from the business.

Shakarmo is a very hardworking and independent woman. She has three kids, two of whom she still supports and who are in elementary and high school, respectively. In search of a way to support her household, she started selling groceries 17 years ago. A true entrepreneur, she studies the market to determine client needs and preferences. Industrious and enterprising, Shakarmo is focused on expanding her business. At the same time with the help of her children Shakarmo raises cattle. In order to grow her business, Shakarmo is requesting a loan of 6400 Somoni ($1475 USD), which she will use to purchase foodstuff to be able to offer a wider selection to her customers and increase her income. With the part of the loan she will also buy young cattle. With the increased sales and profits, Shakarmo hopes to expand her grocery and improve the living standards of her family. The well being of Shakarmo\u2019s family and her business are in your hands. Shakarmo and her children are sincerely grateful for your support.  \n \nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\n\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Her previous loan of PHP 29,500 was used to fund the operations of her various businesses, and it had a positive impact in both the business and the family\u2019s living conditions. Now, for her 18th loan, she is borrowing PHP 29,500, which she intends to use for additional working capital and to purchase farm equipment. Emelyn C. is working hard to achieve her dreams and aspirations for her family, which is to provide them with a brighter future and a more comfortable life.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

K., a 43-year-old married man. Momo has three children aged 8 to 13 years old with educational levels of 4th to 7th grade.\n\nMomo is a high school graduate but could not continue to university due to lack of financial support. He then decided to get into business. He lives in Plumkor Community which is a very poor and crowded community where people strive for their living. It is near Monrovia, the capital of Liberia.\n\nMomo's business is timber. He buys timber whole sourced from rural Liberia and sells to the residents of Monrovia. He started this business through the efforts of friends. Because it was during the Liberian civil crisis that Momo started his business, he used to face difficulties from rebels that always seized his goods. But, because he kept his head up, he was always trying to succeed.\n\nMomo maintains his customers by selling good timber. He has been running this business for nine years and is hoping to improve his business to a better standard. He needs this loan to buy more timber to improve business.\n\nMomo plans to use his 26,000 Liberian dollar portion of this 80,400 Liberian dollar loan to buy more wood planks.

She acquires the vicu\u00f1a and alpaca wool at the July 16th Fair in the city of El Alto.  Her finished blankets are also sold at the fair on Thursdays and Sundays between 7am and 12:30pm.  When necessary, her children help with selling blankets.\r\n<p>\r\nWhen asked what she enjoys most about Pro Mujer, Sra. Mar\u00eda Magdalena indicated that she likes sharing with the other group members, the savings account, and the training classes because she is able to learn.

is Erlinda, 44, resident of Dasmarinas, Cavite City, Philippines. She is married to Reynaldo who is a driver, and mother to her three children, two are still at home while the eldest is already studying. She, together with her husband and children, manage their household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for her everyday expenses.  \r\n \r\nErlinda operates a food stall. In the Philippines, the whole working community and most of the families only eat home-cooked meals during evenings when all of the family members are at home to take part of the meal. This is not only a usual family tradition but a matter of convenience and frugal living. It is considered a waste of money and time to spend cooking gas and food for one to two persons (for other meals) when buying cooked rice and viands cost less than raw food. Aside from this she also sells fruits in her store. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of Php200 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operationing her business she is requesting a Php10,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy more quantities of products like meats, rice, vegetables, condiments and seasonings. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nErlinda hopes her business grows and finds a place in the local market, and dreams to be able to give her children a good and high quality education through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay Micro Finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":873233,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to

Elle re\u00e7oit des commandes de toute la sous r\u00e9gion de l\u2019Afrique de l\u2019ouest (Mali, Burkina et Cote d\u2019Ivoire). Pour avoir ces produits aphrodisiaques, il faut amener une nouvelle calebasse qu\u2019on remplit d\u2019eau propre et qui sera vers\u00e9e sur le gongonlili (plante exotique tr\u00e8s pris\u00e9e en Afrique de l\u2019ouest pour avoir des vertus aphrodisiaques et m\u00e9dicales). Elle donnera \u00e0 ce gongonlili totalement imbib\u00e9 une forme circulaire ou ovale apr\u00e8s l\u2019avoir attach\u00e9 d\u2019un fil blanc.). Cette plante est soit bouillie dans de l\u2019eau chaude et la d\u00e9coction en liquide est consomm\u00e9e. \r\n\r\nPour satisfaire sa client\u00e8le de plus en plus importante, elle d\u00e9cida de rejoindre l\u2019institution de microfinance Soro Yiriwaso depuis maintenant 3 ans. Apr\u00e8s 4 pr\u00eats solidaires, elle est \u00e0 son deuxi\u00e8me pr\u00eat individuel et tous les pr\u00eats pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents ont \u00e9t\u00e9 correctement rembours\u00e9s. Elle compte acheter avec ce pr\u00eat : 50 sacs de gongonlili, 20 kg d\u2019encense, 2 cartons de parfums, 2 rouleaux de fil local et des bouteilles vides de mayonnaise. Elle s\u2019approvisionne en mati\u00e8res premi\u00e8res essentiellement \u00e0 partir de Bamako (capitale de r\u00e9publique du Mali) et San (r\u00e9gion de S\u00e9gou). Tr\u00e8s connue pour d\u00e9tenir cette science, elle r\u00e9alise d\u2019\u00e9normes ventes au comptant souvent en gros \u00e0 une client\u00e8le vari\u00e9e. Elle esp\u00e8re r\u00e9aliser un b\u00e9n\u00e9fice de 200 000 FCFA et r\u00eave ardemment de construire une maison.","en":"Mrs. Kadiatou C. is 47 years old, is married and a mother of one child. She lives in the 3rd district of S\u00e9gou (fourth economic region of the Republic of Mali) with her husband and child. At a young age. she tried herself out at several businesses but without success. She ended up approaching and learning from her grandmother (who is a famous traditional science specialist) to learn the production of Gongonlili and incense, traditional aphrodisiac products. After completing her training, she continued to work in this area concerning secret knowledge. Today, Mrs. Kadiatou C. enjoys a great reputation in her region. She receives orders from all areas of West Africa (Mali, Burkina and Ivory Coast). To produce these aphrodisiac products, a new water bottle needs to be filled with clean water that is poured on the gongonlili (exotic plant in West Africa believed to have aphrodisiac and medical properties). She then shapes the completely soaked gongonlili into a circular or oval form after having attached it to a white wire. This plant is then boiled in hot water and the liquid concoction is then consumed.  She decided to join the Soro Yiriwaso microfinance institution 3 years ago in order to satisfy the needs of her growing clientele. After 4 group loans, this is her second individual loan, with all preceding loans refunded in full. With this loan, she intends to buy: 50 bags of gongonlili, 20 kg of incense, 2 boxes of perfume, 2 rolls of local wire and empty mayonnaise jars. She gets her raw materials primarily from Bamako (capital of the Republic of Mali) and San (S\u00e9gou region). Very well known in this science, she generates enormous cash sales, often in wholesale, with various customers. She hopes to generate a profit of 200.000 FCFA and passionately dreams of building a house.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Ivana Kostic, Kiva

Her family makes their living on tofu. Before, they did not have enough money, so every day, the couple could only make 5 kilogram of tofu to sell, making from 400,000 to 600,000 Vietnamese Dong per month. After joining the TYM fund, they started borrowing money and tried to expand the production, producing from 10 to 15 kilograms of tofu every day and raising from 10 to 20 pigs. Their income now reaches about 2,000,000 Vietnamese Dong per month. Mrs. P. plans to make the next loan of 9,000,000 Vietnamese Dong to buy 800 kilograms of tofu supply. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Vietnamese by Duc Tran, Kiva

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She lives in Mauswagon, Brgy. Sibucao, San Enrique, Negros Occidental. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2005 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her general store business, she is gradually making her family more economically stable.  She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 5,000. Rosie is requesting a loan of PHP 11,000 so that she can buy additional items for her general (sari-sari) store.  This will be her 13th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 14,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey towards economic freedom.  Rosie aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the Dungganon way.  About NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Today, BRAC has emerged as an independent, virtually self-financed paradigm in sustainable human development. It is one of the largest Southern development organizations employing over 100,000 people, 61% of which are women, and working with the twin objectives of poverty alleviation and empowerment of the poor. Diagnosing poverty in human terms and recognizing its multifaceted nature, BRAC approaches poverty alleviation with a holistic approach.\r\n<br><br>The successes of BRAC in the international development arena have stimulated a series of discussions, both with African delegations, who have visited BRAC programs, and with donors who work in Asia and Africa. Both the African countries and the donors have encouraged BRAC to join the development campaign in Africa to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and more recently to join the campaign of \u201cending poverty\u201d, which is an area where Africa represents the greatest global challenge.\r\n<br><br> In Uganda, BRAC registered as a Non Government Organization (NGO) in January 2006 to undertake programs in Education, Health, Water & Sanitation, Agriculture & Livestock and Microfinance. The Microfinance and Education are the pioneer programs launched in Uganda and, as of July 2007, had served 21,273 borrowers and enrolled 1,155 adolescents in its education

She applies fertilizer and harvest the cacao, while her husband usually does the insecticide.  Cacao is a long term plant, as it only produces after it reaches 4 year of age.  Depending on the quality and weather, cacao can produce year round.  It usually needs fertilizing every trimester and insecticide spraying as needed.  It is usually harvested once a week.  Each kg of dried cacao can be sold for about $11 to $15.

Ni Ketut Soli is very motivated in taking care of the plantation as she hopes to improve her family's financial situation.\r\n\r\n<p><b>Translated from Indonesian by Kresna Hartandi, Kiva Volunteer<\/p><\/b>\r\n\r\nNi Ketut Soli, 39 tahun, adalah wanita yang sangat ulet dan pekerja keras.  Sebagai istri dari Putu Tamayana, seorang petani Kakao , Ni Ketut Soli sangat aktif dan berperan  dalam mengelola kebun kakao keluarga ini. Dari pemupukan bahkan sampai pemetikan hasil panen dilakukan oleh ibu dua orang anak ini kecuali dalam penyemprotan hama biasanya  dilakukan oleh suaminya. Kakau termasuk tanaman jangka panjang karena tanaman ini baru bisa berproduksi setelah berumur kurang lebih 4 tahunan. Baru setelah itu tanaman ini akan berbuah terus hampir sepanjang musim dan sangat tergantung dari cara pemeliharaannya, seperti pemupukan setiap 3 bulan sekali begitu juga dengan penyemprotan sesuai dengan kebutuhan. Sedangkan untuk panen raya biasanya dilakukan pemetikan setiap seminggu sekali. Satu Kilogram kakao kering harganya berkisar Rp 10.000,- s.d 13.000,- .Ni Ketut Soli sangat senang dengan hasil yang di perolehnya saat ini. Saat ini ia berencana untuk mendapat pinjaman yang di pergunakan untuk membeli pupuk dan obat-obatan anti hama agar hasil kebun kakaonya menjadi lebih baik. Ni Ketut Soli lebih bersemangat dalam mengelola kebunnya karena ia mempunyai prinsip bahwa semua yang dilakukannya sekarang adalah untuk keluarganya"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":131123,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Purchase
