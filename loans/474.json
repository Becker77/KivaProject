It was very difficult for her to leave her children and work in Russia, coming home only for couple of months per year. Therefore, as soon as she made enough money to start her own business, she did so. <p>Sanoat started her trade at the open-air market with a place 1 meter wide. She considered this place not busy and actively visited by customers, so her first goal was to afford renting better place in the market. She heard about MicroInvest 3 years ago and started receiving loans there. After receiving several loans she could afford to change her place in the market. At the beginning she had only $300 in her turnover and now has over $1200. She will use her next loan for the trip to the wholesale market to buy new seasonal goods.

Especially remarkable are Senegal\u2019s networks of rotating savings and credit associations, known as tontines. Commonly organized by groups of twenty to thirty housewives who live in the same village, the tontines provide poor women throughout the country with small loans to finance modest income-generating activities. Repayment rates within these associations are excellent, because they are based on local reputation and personal trust between the members. However, their financial resources are limited to the contributions of their members, frequently subsistence farmers with very little disposable income. This has prevented the traditional tontines from meeting the demand for rural micro-enterprise loans and restricted their impact on the economic development of their communities. The SEM Fund works to bridge this gap by linking traditional village credit associations with outside sources of finance.

It was a key post along the Silk Road and is where the rule of Alexander the Great ended.  It is famous for its great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets such as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to epic mountain passes, communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

As an aspiring and hard-working man he has always dreamed of achieving success in whatever he does. Thus, when he joined IMON International last year, he was able to make much progress with his previous loan, which he invested mostly in crop farming. Then, he saw a new business opportunity: the rearing of young cattle, which is very profitable because of the constant demand for meat at the market. \r\n<p>\r\nGiven this loan, Islom will purchase young cattle and feed for them to expand his business. He plans to use the profits from his business to educate his children, improve the structure of his home, and improve the standard of living of his family.   \r\n<p>\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n<p>\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; for the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and for its famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, like Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\nIMON's History\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

This is his first loan in the amount of 12,000 meticais, which he will use to purchase construction materials (sheets of metal, bars, sand, and stone) to continue building his house.  He promises to pay back his loan on time so he can request more loans in the future so he can finish his home and offer more comfort to his family.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Tanya

Her husband\u2019s name is N. D. and he operates a loading business with his donkey cart. He puts the load on his donkey cart and delivers it from one place to another.

He is 24 years old, single and lives with his parents.  His mother works as a residential property manager, and his father works as a taxi driver.  Ilhom has a higher education in economics and spent two years working in that field.  Currently, Ilhom provides taxi services and has extensive experience in this field.

Juana plans to finish building her own home, which is something she has worked hard for and persevered on a daily basis with her business to attain. In the future, she will furnish her home with furniture and appliances that she will purchase little by little. Juana has requested an individual loan from MFP [Microfinanzas Prisma] because she feels the organization has helped her in decisive moments with her business. She is committed to make her payments on time. By receiving this help, this hard-working woman will be able to put a roof on her house.

Erlina decidi\u00f3 montar un taller de confecci\u00f3n, actividad que conoc\u00eda pero realizaba espor\u00e1dicamente. En su taller, Erlina ofrece todo tipo de confecci\u00f3n a sus clientes, lo que ha hecho que tenga muy buen reconocimiento y le genere buenas ventas. Debido a que Erlina mont\u00f3 su taller con muy bajo capital, a menudo se ve corta de tiempo y de materias primas para poder responder a los pedidos de sus clientes. Es por esto que Erlina busca que un pr\u00e9stamo le brinde la oportunidad de acceder a la compra de de insumos y materias primas para su confecci\u00f3n como son hilos, agujas, telas, entre otros. \nErlina espera que con esto su negocio siga adelante generando mayores ventas, pues podr\u00e1 satisfacer m\u00e1s necesidades de sus clientes. Erlina tambi\u00e9n espera que su negocio le brinde la posibilidad de brindarle a su hijo una educaci\u00f3n de mejor calidad que a la que puede acceder actualmente. \n"}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1009400,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"Compra de de insumos y materias primas para su confecci\u00f3n como son hilos, agujas, telas, entre otros.

This is because the women have to travel 3 days a week, they come from 3 different town, and the ladies work in 3 different economic activities. One group of 3 women are buying and selling skirts and huipilles (traditional blouses), 3 of them are buying and selling other typical clothes, and the last 3 including the president, make and embroider skirts and pa\u00f1uelos. The pa\u00f1uelos are the pieces fabric women use to carry their babies, their goods from the markets, and during a chilly day they will wrap the panuelos around them to stay a bit warmer.\r\n<P>The president of the group who herself sows and embroiders skirts and huipilles was the one who formed the group. She was inspired by the success of other people who asked for loans before, so she wanted request one too so she can in her own business and improved her life this way.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n\r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged its already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment, forcing  hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve their agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is 55 years old. Perlita is widowed and has seven adult children. To make a living, Perlita owns & operates a business raising crops. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from planting & harvesting  a variety of vegetables for sale. Perlita has been engaged in her business for over 30 years and earns approximately 6,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Perlita joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Perlita has successfully repaid a previous loan of 8,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to purchase fertilizers such as manure. Perlita is requesting a new loan of 11000 PHP which will be used to invest in expanding the business and to partly help in building her house. This loan will be the third loan taken out by Perlita from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to support the education of her children. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, we created this template for our field staff to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It was the location for the end of Alexander the Great's rule, and is known for its great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country, with its epic mountain passes, is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mix of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the USSR, damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 per cent of the country is mountainous and only 7 per cent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands of people to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>More about IMON International<\/b><br>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition.

Combining twenty years of work with preschool children and with a background in competitive gymnastics, ballet, modern dance, theater and horse-vaulting at an international level, it is not surprising that June has seen her business triple since it started in November of 2008.\r\n\r\nTo accommodate her growing client base, June needed to expand her gym into a larger space. A friend from Wells Fargo, who was frustrated that she was unable to help due to the tighter loan qualifying criteria set by banks, referred June to Opportunity Fund.\r\n\r\nWith this loan June will be able to create a safety wall, install netting around the trampoline area, and buy new gym equipment to ensure the gym continues to be a fun, educational, and safe environment. In addition, June will be able to purchase a computer to accommodate new gym software to help grow the business, and contract a bookkeeper to help establish a better budgeting and record-keeping system.\r\n\r\nWith the expansion of her gym and just one semester left to earn her degree in Early Childhood Education, June is close to fulfilling a lifelong dream of owning a preschool-gym business. \u201cMy family especially thinks that this has changed me a lot. I have so much freedom working for my own business compared to when I used to work for somebody else. I am very happy now. Everyone in the family is saying that I am finally doing what I want to do.\u201d\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2000,"image":{"id":489900,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Education

Originally, a micro-credit program created by CHF InternationA., Ameen evolved to become Ameen s.a.l. in 2003, a Lebanese services company. In 2007, Ameen s.a.l. registered with the CentrA.

In the future he hopes to have his own cellar that can contain a large amount of meat.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1225,"image":{"id":685499,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Butcher Shop","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To purchase a large amount of meat","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MN","country":"Mongolia","town":"Bayan-Ulgii","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"46 105","type":"point"}},"partner_id":116,"posted_date":"2011-01-05T05:40:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1225,"lender_count":35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Adebiet ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-12-27T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MNT","disbursal_amount":1500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2011-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2011-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2011-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2011-12-27T08:00:00Z","amount":125000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.08},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.09},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.08},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.08},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.09},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.08},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.08},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.09},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":102.08},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":102.08},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":102.09},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":102.08}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":102.08,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T09:12:39Z","rounded_local_amount":127297.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":196058029},{"amount":205.23,"local_amount":251301.05,"processed_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-16T08:32:02Z","rounded_local_amount":255920.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201496258},{"amount":917.69,"local_amount":1123698.95,"processed_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-24T08:02:19Z","rounded_local_amount":1144356.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":212423106}],"funded_date":"2011-01-08T03:43:17Z","paid_date":"2011-06-24T08:02:19Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Holly Pierce","image":518671}},{"id":267198,"name":"Marifel","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Marifel R. is from the village of Kandiis, Magsaysay, Misamis Oriental.

She is married to Juanito, a tricycle driver, and a mother of two children who already have their own families. She, together with her husband, manages their own household while operating the business. \r\n\r\nElvira operates a food stall. In the Philippines, the whole working community and most of the families only eat home-cooked meals during evenings where all of the family members are at home to take part in the meal. \r\n\r\nThis is not only a typical family tradition but also a matter of convenience and frugal living. It is considered a waste of money and time to use cooking gas and food for one to two persons when buying cooked rice and viands costs less than raw food. \r\n\r\nHer regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 750 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every day. \r\n\r\nTo help her continue operating her business, she is requesting a 10,000 PHP loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy more  products like meats, rice, vegetables, condiments and seasonings. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nElvira dreams to make this store a mini-grocery. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week and where he can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God he studies. \r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay micro-finance loans. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":840861,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To pay for raw ingredients needed in her business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Pasay City","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2011-08-10T15:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":250,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elvira","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-07-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":666.62}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":100,"local_amount":4000.02,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T08:41:07Z","rounded_local_amount":4257.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227005378},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":2666.98,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T08:35:10Z","rounded_local_amount":2838.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232764546},{"amount":66.66,"local_amount":2666,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T09:37:23Z","rounded_local_amount":2837.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238571667},{"amount":16.67,"local_amount":667,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:31:39Z","rounded_local_amount":709.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244529219}],"funded_date":"2011-08-13T18:01:10Z","paid_date":"2011-12-15T09:31:39Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"David Walker","image":null}},{"id":328674,"name":"Ariel","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El se\u00f1or Ariel se dedica al comercio de productos naturales,  su madre y su padre tambi\u00e9n se dedican a esta actividad la familia del se\u00f1or Ariel vive en una zona periurbana de la ciudad, en villa fortaleza,  es soltero,  se dedica a esta actividad desde hace 3 a\u00f1os indica que es una fuente de ingresos para su sustento y  para ayuda de su papa y mama y sus hermanos, el se\u00f1or indica que el dinero que le otorgamos lo emplear\u00e1 en compra de m\u00e1s productos por que  tiene demanda en la ciudad de Santa Cruz de estos productos.

Since she was a child, she had to work with her mother in the markets, selling vegetables, fruit, and clothes. When she got married, she didn't stop working because she had to support her husband in walking sales. Thanks to the effort of the two of them, they were able to save and bought a piece of land for their home in the Isla Trinitaria neighborhood. The business is located in their home, and they work there every day of the week from 5:00 am to 9:00 pm. In the bakery they also sell other products to go with bread such as: milk, cheese, butter, juice. Rosa also saw the opportunity to sell fast foods, so she goes out every afternoon with her cart and her stove to the corner and brings in more income for her household. Rosa wants this loan because she needs to increase her inventory to make bread. She needs certain utensils, and also wishes to renovate her display case for bread, which will certainly help them increase their income. \r\n\r\n<p> Rosa is 59 years old. She has one child who has already finished university. Her husband is her right hand in the business, and he has always supported her in everything. They are a family who come from the mountains, they are very humble, they were never able to go to school which is why they don't know how to read or write but they manage the accounts very well. Their charisma has helped them in dealing with people. Currently they have their house, which at first was made of cane, and bit by bit has been changed to cement. Their greatest satisfaction is to have given their daughter her education.

Since she was very young, she has worked in a variety of activities, and she is now selling sweets from the door of her home. Her children are now adults, so she only needs to earn enough to pay for her personal needs. This business has been going quite well, since her home is located on one if the busiest streets in her community. Elza wants to take advantage of the location by opening a food stand at the corner near her house, where people are already used to stopping by. She currently only sells sweets in the afternoons, since that's when children get out of school, but she plans to start working all day long selling food in order to increase her daily income. Her desire to get ahead in life inspires her to keep working as she has up to this point. She has been working with Microfinanzas Prisma for five years now, and has already taken out 9 previous loans. Her favorite part is the enthusiasm and commitment displayed by her fellow group members to getting ahead and seeing the group make progress. \r\n\r\nThe requested loan of 1,500 soles will allow her to buy the products and ingredients necessary to continue selling sweets, and open up the possibility of starting her own food stand soon. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Cynthia McMurry,

He lives in the Gicumbi district which is in the Northern Province of Rwanda, approximately a one hour drive from Kigali, the capital city.\r\n\r\nJean Nepomuscene has been a proven entrepreneur using a motorcycle-taxi since 2006. He works very hard at his business - the hours he operates his job are from early in the morning until late in the night every day of the week. He enjoys his job as he serves his community through transporting them to and from the border between Rwanda and Uganda where many entrepreneurs go to purchase different goods for sale.\r\n\r\nAfter realizing that motorcycle-taxis are still in short supply in this area and that they are so useful to entrepreneurs, Jean Nepomuscene had the idea of purchasing a second motorcycle to rent to others for them to earn a living so that he can make a profit as well.

When her daughter was young, she dreamed of sending her to college, so she could graduate and have a better career. However, because of poverty she cannot blame her daughter for deciding to not pursue her own education. Instead of being upset and frustrated, Eufemia continuously supports her daughter and her family, hoping that her grandchildren will have a better life than what their mother had. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now that Eufemia has joined ASHI, she is requesting her second loan, so that she can continue to grow the hog-fattening business she started with her first loan. After raising her hogs for four months, she will sell them, and the larger the hogs are, the higher price per kilo of pork she will receive and the greater the profit she will earn. She will then be able to achieve her dream little by little.

Su mayor anhelo es poder seguir adelante para apoyar a su esposo y brindarle a sus hijos la oportunidad de tener un futuro prometedor.\n","en":"Mar\u00eda Esther is a mother, 45 years old, who lives with her husband and two of her four children in the Collique Alto sector of the Za\u00f1a district, a rural area where people make their living in agriculture, located one hour from the city of Chiclayo.\r\n\r\nSince she was 18 years old, Mar\u00eda Esther has worked raising and selling animals. When she moved in with her husband, this business became an important contribution to the family's economic support, since her husband works as an agricultural laborer and his income does not suffice to maintain the family. \r\n\r\nMaria Esther usually raises turkeys, ducks and pigs in the area behind her house, and she sells them to traders who regularly visit the area. The numbers of animals she is raising has increased, and the pens are becoming too small for the animals she currently has. For this reason, she would like to expand her pens, but since she does not have sufficient capital to undertake this project, she has found it necessary to request a loan for the first time. She is asking for a loan from Edpyme Alternativa for 1200 Peruvian new soles, which will help her achieve her goal. \r\n\r\nMar\u00eda Esther is a woman who is devoted to her family and to her small business. Her greatest desire is to get ahead so that she can help her husband and give her children the opportunity to have a promising future. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Patricia Linderman, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":497248,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Expanding her animal pens","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Collique Alto -

They live in the Kuluyo community in the Sacaba province of the city of Cochabamba.  He has worked in agriculture for the past 20 years; he works with his wife growing crops like potatoes, peas, and beans.\r\n\r\nBenedicto is a hard-working person who has had a difficult life since he was a child; he was the oldest of 5 children and he had to take care of his family after the death of his father.  His father worked in construction and passed away when a building fell on top of him; Benedicto's mother became an alcoholic after being widowed with her 4 children.  Benedicto started to work and he left school to help his siblings; he couldn't work in the fields and study at the same time because the school only ran in the mornings.\r\n\r\nBenedicto is seeking a loan to buy seeds as planting season for potatoes and vegetables is approaching; he needs to buy seeds and fertilizer which will help his crops and improve his income.  His wife works making cheese which she sells in the town.  They both work hard so that their children can have a better life, finish school and hopefully find better work in the future.  Benedicto dreams of helping his young daughter to study to become a teacher who can help teach the children of alcoholic parents--just as he used to be.  In this way, these kids won't have to stop studying and will have a better future.  He is very proud of his family and of his wife because she is always supporting him; taking care of his family is the most important thing in his life.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Scott Crandall, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":532851,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Buy seeds and organic fertilizer","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"Cochabamba","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-17.383333 -66.15","type":"point"}},"partner_id":140,"posted_date":"2010-05-03T21:50:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":500,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Benedicto","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-04-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":500}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":500,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T10:53:54Z","rounded_local_amount":500,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211200976}],"funded_date":"2010-05-08T19:42:46Z","paid_date":"2011-06-15T10:53:54Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Scott Crandall","image":163705}},{"id":201655,"name":"Lourdes","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Lourdes, de 42 a\u00f1os, vive con su esposo y sus 2 hijos en su casa que es propia.Desde hace 20 a\u00f1os se dedica al comercio de alfalfa.

The family resides in their own home on the edge of the Peruvian jungle in the town of Quimbiri.\r\n\r\nM\u00e1ximo has always enjoyed excelling in any opportunity that presents itself.  For example, coffee grows naturally in the valley where he lives, so that's why he grows coffee.  It is one of the most sought after products in the market so it is advantageous to engage in the coffee growing business.  M\u00e1ximo favors growing coffee because its sales produce good earnings in order to support his family.  He is also involved in other businesses such as producing and marketing pineapple, thus diversifiying his products to keep ahead of other competitors.\r\n\r\nM\u00e1ximo is usually self-employed, but he sometimes gets help from his wife.  However, when it is sowing and harvest season, he has workers to help him harvest the crop, which is later sold in the collection centers in the area.  \r\n\r\nThis is M\u00e1ximo's fourth loan with MFP and he is committed to completing his payments on time.  He is also happy to work with his community bank because of its good performance.  With the requested loan, he plans to invest in properly maintaining his coffee and pineapple plantations by purchasing agricultural inputs and fertilizer.  \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Angela Yeh, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":598403,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy fertilizer for his coffee and pineapple plantations","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"CUSCO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.518333 -71.978056","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-09-10T21:50:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maximo ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-29T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":375}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":375,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:37:53Z","rounded_local_amount":1047.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201326965}],"funded_date":"2010-09-15T16:33:29Z","paid_date":"2011-04-15T11:37:53Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Angela Yeh","image":827898}},{"id":234429,"name":"Veronica","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Veronica B. is from the village of San Isidro.

She started her business when she was very young.  She studied techniques for making rag dolls on a small table in her home and displayed the dolls for sale to students and housewives together with exercise books, pencils and pencil sharpeners, all at a good price.\r\n\r\nLittle by little Rosmira's business increased as did her customers and she added the display cases she now has one by one.  She also studied at a technical training center, learning a number of techniques which she liked.  She did a course on making underwear, using sewing machines and dressmaking in general and when she'd finished learning she went to work in a workshop where she perfected her art.  She still had her display cases in her house, however, helped by her family.  She managed to support her household very well in this way, especially as regards her children's studies.  She currently she feels very satisifed with her achievements but she fully intends to continue growing as a person and she wants to continue strengthening her business.\r\n\r\nThis is Rosmira's first loan and she will use it in her small business which is called \u201cVariedades Rosmy\u201d and specializes in selling ceramics, dolls and accessories, stationery and dressmaking supplies.

In the afternoons she sold fruit desserts, stuffed potatoes, oatmeal, and fried bread. She slowly saved enough to open a small store that she still has, and from where she sells a wide variety of products such as groceries, candy, and drinks. Just before the school year starts, she sells school supplies, and she also prepares lunches for the local children. In addition to these activities she is responsible for looking after a family-owned internet place. <p>\r\n\r\nHer first loan of S\/. 300.00 obtained from the Grupo Mientras Tanto \u201cLas Auroras en Acci\u00f3n\u201d was used to buy a liquidizer so that she could make juices, and she also bought fruit at wholesale prices. With the S\/.1000.00 loan she will buy more stock for her store, as well as school supplies at the beginning of the school year. She plans to pay back the loan within six months. Her biggest dream is to expand her store and to buy a mobile van from which to sell hamburgers in the evenings. \r\n<p><b>Translated from Spanish by Jane Agg, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nLa se\u00f1ora Benny Margarita \u00c1lamo P. tiene 27 a\u00f1os de edad, tiene un solo hijo que aun depende de ella.Vive en el sector Aurora D\u00edaz en el distrito de Salaverry en la provincia de Trujillo departamento La Libertad \u2013 Per\u00fa.<p>\r\n\r\nSu negocio se inicia vendiendo marcianos en temporada de verano, por las tardes vend\u00eda mazamorra, papa rellena, avenas y cachangas.

Together with her husband, who is currently working in Russia, Muborak has raised three children. In addition, she has run a drug store for eight years, selling certified medicines. The drug store is located in the town center, so it attracts many customers. Muborak is requesting $600 USD to expand her business. With the consequent increase in income, she is planning to educate all of her children through higher education. Being very precise by nature, Muborak would like to assure lenders that she is able and ready to repay the loan in nine months. This loan will help her accomplish her goals in a short time. Your generosity can change lives.  \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan\r\nTajikistan, a key post on the Silk Road, is perhaps best known for its rich history. It was the location for the end of Alexander the Great's rule, and is known for its great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country, with its epic mountain passes, is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mix of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n<p>However, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the USSR, damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 per cent of the country is mountainous and only 7 per cent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands of people to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nMore about IMON International\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition.

He doesn't employ any helpers and earns a monthly salary of 6800.00 Meticales, which he uses to cover household expenses. He also saves some in his bank account.\r\n\r\nJo\u00e3o had taken out loans before with the Banco Milenium Bim, but he decided not to continue with them. He found out about Hluvuku [the Kiva Field Partner] through his parents-in-law. This is his 2nd loan, for the amount of 15,000.00 Meticales. He plans to use this money to buy construction materials (cement, sand, support beams, zinc plates and other items) in order to continue working on his home construction project. His earlier loan was for 10,000.00 Meticales and was used for the same purpose.\r\n\r\nHe promises to repay the loan as indicated in order to be eligible for other loans later. In the future he would like to apply for more loans to start his own business.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Catherine Fountain, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":507474,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":null,"use":"Purchase of construction materials (cement, sand, support beams, zinc plates and other items)","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MZ","country":"Mozambique","town":"Boane, Maputo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-26.041667 32.325278","type":"point"}},"partner_id":23,"posted_date":"2010-03-19T03:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":475,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Joao Antonio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MZN","disbursal_amount":15000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":17,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","amount":681.29},{"due_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":709.29},{"due_date":"2010-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":738.44},{"due_date":"2010-06-29T07:00:00Z","amount":768.79},{"due_date":"2010-07-29T07:00:00Z","amount":800.38},{"due_date":"2010-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":833.27},{"due_date":"2010-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":867.52},{"due_date":"2010-10-27T07:00:00Z","amount":903.17},{"due_date":"2010-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":940.28},{"due_date":"2010-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":978.93},{"due_date":"2011-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":1019.16},{"due_date":"2011-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":1061.04},{"due_date":"2011-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":1104.64},{"due_date":"2011-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1150.04},{"due_date":"2011-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1197.3},{"due_date":"2011-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1246.46}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.57},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.47},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.38},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.34},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.35},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.39},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.47},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.6},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.77},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.28},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.6},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.98},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.41},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.92},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.47}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":58.66,"local_amount":1852.34,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:14:16Z","rounded_local_amount":1871.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136698728},{"amount":8.76,"local_amount":276.68,"processed_date":"2010-05-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:28:05Z","rounded_local_amount":279.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144732394},{"amount":407.58,"local_amount":12870.98,"processed_date":"2010-06-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:54:36Z","rounded_local_amount":13002.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151916212}],"funded_date":"2010-04-06T23:40:43Z","paid_date":"2010-07-15T09:54:36Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"C.

He's 42 years old and happily married to Olga, 30. They have five children and live together in their own home. He's been working as a farmer for 10 years, growing cacao, annatto, citrus, avocados, and plantains, and his son helps him and lightens his workload. His favorite is harvesting avocados, since he likes to eat them, especially if they come from his own farm. A few years ago he wanted to produce more profits for his family, so he set up a broom-making workshop, making the brooms out of strong dried leaves and selling them in his mother's store.

She is married and has 6 children, who are between 11 and 26 years old.  All of them go to school.  Fauza only completed elementary school; she did not continue due to a lack of financial resources.  She lives in her own house with her family and supports 3 nieces and nephews who live with her.\r\n\r\nShe left Maputo for Boane when she became widowed after the death of her first husband.  She has had her own business selling bundles of tobacco for more than 25 years.  She does not have any employees and earns about 12,000 MZN each month, which she uses to pay for expenses.  She is even able to save some in her bank account.\r\n\r\nFauza never has had loans with other banks.  She found out about Hluvuku through friends who are also clients of this institution.  This is her 3rd loan, which has a value of 20,000 MZN.  She plans to use it to buy products (sacks of tobacco) to increase her stock.  The previous loans were for 12,000 MZN and 15,000 MZN, both for the same purpose.\r\n\r\nShe promises to pay back the loan on time so that she will be able to have access to others.  In the future, she intends to request more loans to help improve her business.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Erika Korowin, Kiva

She is 24 years old. Maria Riza is single and has one infant-aged child. To make a living, Maria Riza owns and operates a specialized retail store.

opportunities. She believes in her potential to set her life on a new stage and a new path. \r\n\r\nMavluda T., 25, is the leader of this group. She\u2019s a resident of a very small town in the southern Kyrgyzstan, Nookat, with a population of over 13,000 people. She was born and grew up here and wants to spend the rest of her life here because she knows it\u2019s the best place for her children. Mavluda\u2019s husband Dastan is a successful musician and the main breadwinner of the family. \r\n\r\nThey feel blessed to have two daughters of 5 and 3 years old. Last year when the kids were accepted to a daycare, Mavluda needed an occupation to devote her whole daytime. Being a mother has taught her good lessons of choosing the right products for her girls. So she ended up with the idea of selling children\u2019s clothing. She can easily find common language with other mothers who look for the best clothing for their children. The business was started from 1, 000 soms taken from a family\u2019s savings. For now Mavluda receives 7,500 soms of profit every month, most of which she puts back into goods circulation. Mavluda requested a loan from Kiva with intentions of satisfying her consumer needs. In the nearest future the family would like to renew the apartment lease.\r\n\r\n       --- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance (MBF), a young, ambitious and socially-focused Microfinance Institution in Kyrgyzstan. \r\n\r\nMBF is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development and upholds the triple bottom line \u2013 People (building human capital and taking care of its customers as well as society), Planet (keeping environmentally friendly) and Profit (earning revenue to expand autonomously).

He is known as a humble and hardworking father.  Victor lives in his own home with his wife Aquilina, age 42, and their four young children who they protect and care for with much love.  Every day, early in the morning, Victor leaves to work in the fields.  For him, there are no days to rest because he must work continually to care for his crops so that he can have good production.  His main products are potatoes and peas, which he sells in bulk in the city of Tarma.  What he enjoys most about his job is the freedom he experiences working among his crops.  He is able to freely enjoy a stroll through his green fields.  Victor has been farming for 30 years and considers the most difficult part to be protecting his crops from swarms of insects that can affect their growth.  In the future, he wants to buy a car so that he can transport his products to the wholesale market in Tarma.  According to Victor, when prices are the highest, he sells his vegetables in the capital so that he can obtain the most earnings.  His main difficulty has been setting aside enough capital from his earnings to invest in the planting season and in his business.  \r\n<p>\r\nVictor is a member of the Communal Bank \u201cLos Pinos de Antabamba\u201d (The Pines of Antabamba) and will be receiving his sixth loan with MFP.  He hopes that this financial support will help him achieve his goals.  Once again, he promises to complete his repayments on time just as he did with his previous loans.  Victor is pleased to be part of his Communal Bank because all of the members are responsible and supportive individuals.  With this support, Victor will invest the money he requested in the purchase of cattle including bulls and cows.  He plans to take advantage of this season to raise and fatten cattle since there are no crops to harvest.  Victor hopes to resell the cattle at a good price.   \r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":793859,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase a bull and a cow.

She studied up to third grade of high school. She is married and has two children, a boy 15 years old and a girl 13 years old. They both attend high school. She sells demijohns of purified water. She is asking for the loan to buy demijohns of water. She started her business 8 months ago. As her husband works at the water bottling factory, they give her a week's credit so she told him to bring her some demijohns of water to sell.

Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations.

In 2005, she joins the TYM Fund and takes out loans to invest in livestock. The business is prosperous, family\u2019s economy is better and she can provide more to her children\u2019s education.

When someone has an old or broken piece of furniture, they take it to her.  She has begun a small business repairing chairs, sofas, beds, and other furniture.  Left by her husband several years ago, Estama has found herself in the same position as many women here in the Dominican and in her home country, Haiti.  She is left to provide for her two boys (ages 14, 16) with whatever means she can.  The money from this loan will go towards purchasing paint, sand paper, various tools, as well as several old beds that may be refurbished and sold.  She aspires to continue growing her business, so that someday she might be able to own her own shop that she can work out of.\r\n<p>\r\nEstama is one of the leaders of the 10 person micro bank Hermanas Unidas, which means \"United Sisters\". All ten women in the bank are Haitian immigrants who have come to earn a living in the Dominican informal sector. These unique entrepreneurs unite in solidarity, promising to cover one another if someone fails on a payment, thus allowing them to access funding that they would otherwise never be able to receive on their own.  The concept of this group bank paying their loan together is to reduce the risk of one person defaulting due to the strong peer pressure from their fellow bank members.  As these 10 women embark upon their firS.ever loan from Esperanza, we are confident that they will all succeed in bettering their lives and the lives of their families with this loan. Their businesses are simple, but offer a stream of income that could never have been accomplished without such a loan for initial capital.  Several of the women sell clothes and shoes in the street, and a couple of them will offer housecleaning services and beauty supplies.\r\n<p>\r\nOn behalf of Estama M., the Hermanas Unidas group, and the entire team here at Esperanza International, we thank you for your support and awareness of the global issue of poverty, in which your efforts are helping to make a difference"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1600,"image":{"id":182903,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Upholstery","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"To purchase, paint, sandpaper, tools, and several old beds to be refurbished and sold.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"DO","country":"Dominican Republic","town":"Puerto Plata","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"19.75 -70.75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":44,"posted_date":"2008-08-01T20:50:17Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1600,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Estama","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Catia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bernadette","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Senatus","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Chartes","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bonny","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Ernise","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Suzette","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Serafine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Anide","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-08-16T03:05:56Z","disbursal_currency":"DOP","disbursal_amount":54000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":1600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":9000},{"due_date":"2008-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":9000},{"due_date":"2008-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":9000},{"due_date":"2008-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":9000},{"due_date":"2009-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":9000},{"due_date":"2009-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":9000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":266.67},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":266.67},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":266.67},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":266.67},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":266.67},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":266.65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":267,"local_amount":9011.25,"processed_date":"2008-09-16T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-09-17T07:12:26Z","rounded_local_amount":9151.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":328236},{"amount":267,"local_amount":9011.25,"processed_date":"2008-10-16T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-17T07:10:26Z","rounded_local_amount":9151.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":362009},{"amount":266,"local_amount":8977.5,"processed_date":"2008-11-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-16T02:57:59Z","rounded_local_amount":9117.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5312802},{"amount":266.67,"local_amount":9000,"processed_date":"2008-12-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-15T20:17:44Z","rounded_local_amount":9140.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9930349},{"amount":266.67,"local_amount":9000,"processed_date":"2009-01-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T11:48:56Z","rounded_local_amount":9140.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14854923},{"amount":266.66,"local_amount":9000,"processed_date":"2009-02-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T08:10:49Z","rounded_local_amount":9140.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20394205}],"funded_date":"2008-08-02T03:05:56Z","paid_date":"2009-03-16T08:10:49Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":61526,"name":"Sorng","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mr. S.

Having repaid their last loan successfully, they are now requesting a new loan of SLL 1,000,000 each to further strengthen their businesses.\n\nKadiatu (right) is the leader of this group. Kadiatu was born in Makeni City, in northern Sierra Leone. She is age 37, and married to a businessman.  They have four children. Three of their children are in primary school and one is in secondary school. Kadiatu sells second-hand clothes for children (junks). She has been in this business for three years now. With this loan, Kadiatu will buy two bales of second hand clothes. A bale of used clothes for children is sold for Le 410,000 and she will pay a fare of Le 10,000 to Freetown where bales of junks are sold.\n\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":314790,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Used Clothing","sector":"Clothing","themes":["Conflict Zones"],"use":"Buy two bales of second hand clothes","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SL","country":"Sierra Leone","town":"Makeni","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"8.883333 -12.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":57,"posted_date":"2009-05-15T19:10:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":650,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kadiatu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Aminata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-04-06T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"SLL","disbursal_amount":2000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":200000},{"due_date":"2009-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":200000},{"due_date":"2009-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":200000},{"due_date":"2009-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":200000},{"due_date":"2009-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":200000},{"due_date":"2009-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":200000},{"due_date":"2009-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":200000},{"due_date":"2009-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":200000},{"due_date":"2010-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":200000},{"due_date":"2010-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":200000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":65,"local_amount":200000,"processed_date":"2009-05-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:02:57Z","rounded_local_amount":204750,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44611671},{"amount":16.25,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T23:55:39Z","rounded_local_amount":51187.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53008612},{"amount":113.75,"local_amount":350000,"processed_date":"2009-07-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:22:32Z","rounded_local_amount":358312.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63230957},{"amount":65,"local_amount":200000,"processed_date":"2009-08-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:37:31Z","rounded_local_amount":204750,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73662637},{"amount":65,"local_amount":200000,"processed_date":"2009-09-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T02:16:42Z","rounded_local_amount":204750,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87102963},{"amount":65,"local_amount":200000,"processed_date":"2009-10-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T06:02:52Z","rounded_local_amount":204750,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97019975},{"amount":65,"local_amount":200000,"processed_date":"2009-11-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:34:58Z","rounded_local_amount":204750,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103864820},{"amount":65,"local_amount":200000,"processed_date":"2009-12-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T16:37:01Z","rounded_local_amount":204750,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110754627},{"amount":65,"local_amount":200000,"processed_date":"2010-01-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:32:29Z","rounded_local_amount":204750,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118143646},{"amount":65,"local_amount":200000,"processed_date":"2010-02-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T11:13:06Z","rounded_local_amount":204750,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123981104}],"funded_date":"2009-05-15T23:52:18Z","paid_date":"2010-03-15T11:13:06Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"John Lynch","image":null}},{"id":110697,"name":"Evangeline","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Evangeline V., 38 years old, is married to Mr. Nestor V., a fisherman.

He breeds calves, cows, and sheep. He is married and has three children whom he supports. He wants to continue to be able to give them a proper education. \r\n\r\nRafickjon has improved his financial situation since his father was also a cattle breeder, so he has gained rich experience in the livestock business since childhood. Today, his biggest dream is to expand his business and to also offer dairy products in his community and surrounding areas. Therefore, his biggest need is to get a loan in order to buy more cows. \r\n\r\nRafickjon is very grateful to everyone who is helping him to improve his living.  \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes being a key post along the Silk Road and being the location of the end of the rule of Alexander the Great. It is also known for its famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists, and poets, such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi, and many others. The country, filled with epic mountain passes, is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, and boasts a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture, and Central Asian traditions. \r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 percent of the country is mountainous and only seven percent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nMore about IMON International\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition.

She is married to Freddy Chavarr\u00eda Guill\u00e9n. Mayubel sells clothing door-to-door in her neighbourhood. Freddy works in construction. The couple lives with their 3 sons in Turrialba, a rural region in the central valley of Costa Rica. Her full-time job is a domestic worker in a household of 3 grown men and one child. Despite the heavy workload of cooking and cleaning for her sons and husband, she is determined to contribute to the family\u2019s income. This is why she dedicates at least 3 days a week, between domestic jobs and when her youngest son is in school, to her clothing business. \r\n\r\nSince 2006, Mayubel has successfully paid back, on time and in full, consecutive loans in the amounts of 100,000, 200,000 and 300,000 colones. Mayubel is now applying for a loan of 500,000 colones that she will use to buy more items for her inventory in bulk show she can bet better prices from her suppliers. She is happy to be applying for a larger amount than she has in the past. Mayubel wants to purchase a new sewing machine so she can make her own clothes to sell. At the moment, she has one machine, but it is very old and doesn\u2019t work very well. \r\n\r\nMayubel opened her business in 2006 with 100,000 colones. Before her business, she had a domestic worker job that required her to travel from Turrialba to Tres Rios (a 90-minute bus ride each way) every day. She worked for 7 years in a house as a domestic worker and was paid 6000 colones per day, which is the same amount she now earns by selling 2 shirts. \r\n\r\nHaving only completed primary school, Mayubel has few options for employment. Domestic work did not pay well and the job left her exhausted. She started her business as an alternative to domestic work. Now, she says she enjoys her work, and takes pride in being able to make a more significant contribution to family income. In a good month, she can earn 300,000 colones and in a bad month, she still earns 200,000 colones. \r\n\r\nMayubel tailors her business to a range of clients by offering a variety of clothing, for men, women and children. Her sister-in-law makes underwear, which Mayubel can purchase at a good price. The rest of her inventory comes from San Jose, the capital of Costa Rica. \r\n\r\nMayubel is proud to report that her youngest son is very intelligent. She wants to save enough money to enable him to attend university. Her other two sons never finished high school and now work with their father in construction.\r\n\r\nThe field consultant who has worked with Mayubel since 2006 describes her as very shy and insecure. Having loans in her name and handling money has made her visibly more confident in making decisions. Rural areas, such as Turrialba, are characterized by many difficulties such as a lack of job opportunities, infrastructural deficiencies, low levels of formal education and lack of available financial services. By lending to Mayubel, you are making a direct investment in the improvement of the life of her and her family, enabling them to help themselves."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":900,"image":{"id":443565,"template_id":1},"video":{"id":1535,"youtubeId":"cZP48QBSv7E","title":"Kiva Entrepreneur

She is married and has a 1-year-old child.  She owns a business planting, harvesting and selling taamu, a root vegetable much like taro. Liaina has 1 year of experience in this business.  \r\n\r\nLiaina needs a loan of WST 1000 to purchase harvesting equipment, such as wheelbarrows, shovels, rakes, baskets, and knives.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 150 talas or US $63 per week) to pay for her children's tuition fees.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Liaina joined SPBD.  This is her 1st loan from SPBD. SPBD's loans are Liaina's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan from traditional banks.\r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.

The idea to start this business she reveals came from her husband.

She has used the knowledge she has acquired to streamline, improve and bring changes to bear on her business. \r\n\r\nOn the side Polline also ekes out supplementary profits from a pig husbandry and sales business.
