El Cedro is in the state of Veracruz.  Development cooperatives are groups of 10 or more individuals who have a bank account and who have to meet weekly or every two weeks in order to make their payments.  This group has a representative and a governing committee, and is comprised of ten members.  \r\n\r\nThe group\u2019s representative is named Adolfo G. G\u00f3mez.  Adolfo is 48 years old, married, and has two children.  He is going to set up a stationery store in his home and needs a loan so that he can purchase blank paper, cards, and other supplies.  His customers are the children who attend the school that is situated a half block from his house.  Adolfo has been a teacher at that school for twenty-seven years.  He tells us that times are difficult, and so he decided to find other work in order to earn a little more.  Adolfo wants this loan so that he can increase his earnings and thus be able to purchase basic foodstuffs for his children. He hopes that his children will finish their studies someday and be able to purchase their own homes.  He is happy to be the group\u2019s president, since he wants to help the rest of the group, and without help from the other members they would not receive this loan.\r\n\r\nAgustina Mi\u00f1\u00f3n M. serves as treasurer on El Cedro group\u2019s governing committee.

She makes a living selling gold, hand-sewn goods, embroideries, and paintings, and needs a loan so that she can purchase gold jewelry and cut glass.  Her customers are her neighbors and include other members of El Cedro group, who purchased jewelry and bathroom sets from her.  She has made a living from sewing for twenty-four years and learned this craft when she was in school, but she has only been painting for a little while.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\"\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

their house come true.\r\n\r\nHe is very grateful to Emprender and to Kiva for the trust placed in him by granting the loan.\r\n\r\n   \t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by

Con el tiempo, espera comprar m\u00e1s tierras y as\u00ed incrementar su producci\u00f3n. Este es el sexto pr\u00e9stamo de Renee con MFP y esta ahorrando para pagar sus cuotas a tiempo, ya que no quiere causarle problemas a las socias de su banco comunal, donde se siente muy contenta. Con los dos mil nuevos soles solicitados, comprar\u00e1 m\u00e1s abono para que sus cultivos sean m\u00e1s productivos.\n\n","en":"Renee is a 45 year old woman who is hardworking and cheerful.  She lives in her own home with her husband Nicol\u00e1s, age 45, and their three young children for whom she wants to provide a better quality of life.  The long days of working on her land have made Renee an expert in agriculture.  She takes good care of her crops so that they grow in healthy conditions, which gives her an advantage when it comes time to sell them.  Renee always gets a good price for the coffee and bananas that she produces.  What she enjoys most about her work is cultivating the land since it is something she has done since she was a little girl.  She has been doing this for 30 years and considers the most difficult part to be transporting her products to the city of La Merced.  In time she hopes to buy more land so that she can increase her production.\r\n<p>\r\nThis is her sixth loan with MFP.  Renee sets aside enough money so that she can make her payments on time because she does not want to create problems for the members of her Communal Bank.  She feels happy to be part of this group.  The loan of 2000 PEN that she requested will be used to buy more compost for her crops so that she can be more productive.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":559483,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Purchase compost","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Chanchamayo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.05 -75.316667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-07-02T07:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":725,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Renee","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-29T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-27T08:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":725}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":725,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:00:18Z","rounded_local_amount":2048.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182588330}],"funded_date":"2010-07-02T13:33:28Z","paid_date":"2010-12-15T15:00:18Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ronan Reodica","image":498323}},{"id":214380,"name":"Getrude","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Getrude is a single woman with two children, both of whom attend school.

Solijon is 36 years old and is married. Together with his wife they have four children, all of whom are still young and attending school. They are farmers who own a plot of land in their village and grow different kinds of crops like, wheat, potato, onion and other vegetables. They have been in this business since 2003. These crops are the main source of income for their family.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Their collective knowledge and experience in their respective markets gives them confidence that they will be able to confront adversity and come out ahead. The loan will be used to buy tools, ingredients and primary materials, so that the group members can expand their businesses and increase their incomes in order to be able to offer their children better educations and a better quality of life. The majority of the group's members have experience with communal banking and know how to manage loan repayments responsibly and honestly, and how to take full advantage of this opportunity offered by the Agrocapital Foundation for a better life. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Sara Sultan, Kiva

T., and Fania Yudel V. E..  The three are from the same  community and have a strong credit history together. Each has received loans previously and as a result has seen their respective businesses grow.\n\nMar\u00eda will use this loan to purchase used clothing for her resale shop, the loan allows her to buy in bulk and therefore receive a better price. She will also buy chickens and pigs in order to supplement the income of her store. For fifteen years her store has supported she and her two children, ages 10 and 13, they are both in school. Maria dreams of being able to afford home improvements such as building brick walls.\n\nJuan is married and has five children, the eldest two are more than 20 years old, the rest are still in school.  Of late his family faces the difficulty of Sugar Disease which Juan\u2019s wife has fallen ill with. Juan used other loans to purchase a cart and a horse to pull it. This loan will go towards improvements to the cart and the purchase of wood for resale. Juan has sold wood and driven his carriage for thirteen years since he fell ill and could not work in the fields. He dreams that his business will continue to provide for his children\u2019s education. \n\nFania Yudel is single with a 2 year old son.

She owns a business venture raising cattle.  Naomi has 5 years of experience in this business.  Naomi needs a loan of WST $1500. She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 600 tala or US $250 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Naomi joined SPBD.    This is her 2nd loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Naomi's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Naomi T. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.87 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              2 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         2 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              1 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\"\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

BRAC and BRAC Uganda<\/b><br><br>\r\nBRAC (Building Resources Across Communities) is a development organization that began operations in Bangladesh as a small-scale relief and rehabilitation project in 1972 to help the country overcome the devastation and trauma of the liberation war and focused on resettling refugees returning from India. Today, BRAC has emerged as an independent, virtually self-financed paradigm in sustainable human development. It is one of the largest Southern development organizations employing over 100,000 people, 61% of which are women, and working with the twin objectives of poverty alleviation and empowerment of the poor. Diagnosing poverty in human terms and recognizing its multifaceted nature, BRAC approaches poverty alleviation with a holistic approach.\r\n<br><br>The successes of BRAC in the international development arena have stimulated a series of discussions, both with African delegations, who have visited BRAC programs, and with donors who work in Asia and Africa. Both the African countries and the donors have encouraged BRAC to join the development campaign in Africa to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and more recently to join the campaign of \u201cending poverty\u201d, which is an area where Africa represents the greatest global challenge.\r\n<br><br> In Uganda, BRAC registered as a Non Government Organization (NGO) in January 2006 to undertake programs in Education, Health, Water & Sanitation, Agriculture & Livestock and Microfinance. The Microfinance and Education are the pioneer programs launched in Uganda and, as of July 2007, had served 21,273 borrowers and enrolled 1,155 adolescents in its education

They know what they are going to do to earn their livelihood. The group's leader, Damira, is among them. A 36-year-old hairdresser and mother of three children, Damira has dedicated many years to her occupation. She was just a 16-year-old girl when she finished hairdressing courses. She swiftly learned all aspects of her profession, providing all kinds of hair-related services: various haircuts, hair dyeing styles, hair setting, and hairdos (e.g., waved, curled, perm, marcel waves, etc.). She has become an A1 specialist. She has assigned a room and adjusted it to be a hairdressing salon. By saving her profits, she recently purchased a car. Damira feels that she can do better and that she is just not using all the opportunities. So, she has planned to make an improvement at her salon. She is firmly convinced that if she furnishes and decorates her salon, more customers will be attracted. Damira needs a loan to equip her salon with shelves and wallpaper. In the near future, she is going to expand her business by taking on a few apprentices. People do grow when they have a vision of how to do that.\r\n<p>\r\nDamira\u2019s partners: <br>\r\nGulzina, age 44 and mother of two children, works as a cleaner at a casino. She needs a loan to buy building materials for her kitchen and to buy a chandelier. <br>\r\nJumabu is age 56. She and her husband are farmers. They have three children. They need a loan to buy fuels and lubricants, as well as to pay for transportation services and to pay workers for harvesting. <br>\r\nEdilbek, age 35, is married and has one child. He works as an assistant station-master in \"Tuz\" substation. He needs a loan to place a crusher at the same substation and to buy some cement for installing it. <br>\r\nAida, age 38, is a housewife. She sells milk and also produces cheese and butter. She needs a loan to buy a milk cow. <br>\r\nNazgul, age 38, is married. She has three children. To make a living she sells yogurt, sour cream and cottage cheese. She hopes to get a loan to buy a milk cow.\r\n<p>\r\n<p>\r\nWhere Did This Loan Come From?<br>\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance, a young and ambitious socially-focused MFI in Kyrgyzstan. Mol Bulak Finance is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development on the basis of a 3-Ps concept: People (building human capital and taking care of its customers and society as well), Profit (to be profitable, to grow further), and the Planet (taking care of the environment).

She thanks you for your support.  \r\n\r\nIn the Kathmandu Valley, the small grocery stores, called pasals, are an important part of the local economy. Fresh produce, milk and staples such as rice, lentils and flour are purchased daily for cooking in the home. Owners of small grocery stores use Kiva loans to increase their purchasing power and profit margins. By keeping inventory strong and purchasing in larger amounts, owners of these small stores are able to increase profitability. While a typical pasal might be no more than 100 sq. feet, they are always full of bargaining customers, in-coming produce and shrewd businesswomen. \r\n\r\nThis loan was administered by Kiva's local partner MFI, Patan Business and Professional Women. Patan BPW became Kiva's first field partner in Nepal in 2007. Patan BPW operates throughout the Kathmandu Valley, offering microcredit and business training programs to low-income women. In addition to providing economic opportunity to their clients, Patan BPW seeks to empower Nepali women within the home and community. \r\n\r\nFor more information about Patan BPW, visit our partner

Every day, very early in the morning, Julia begins caring for her land since she knows that the profits she makes from her sales will depend on the quality of her products.  Her crops are cacao, coffee and coca leaf.  These are products which are in most demand in her area.  She takes them to sell in the city of San Francisco as this is where she gets the best prices.

He has worked at this business for a long time and has acquired his abilities in ranching and farming over a long period of time. He is a married father with responsibilities for maintaining his 3 children. \r\n\r\nOlim is known as being very responsible and hard-working. Every day, very early in the morning, he starts his job taking care of his fields while at the same time raising cattle in his own pen located at his house. IMON International has been the backbone of his business because of having granted loans which have allowed him to improve his standard of living. This has been achieved through the acquisition of cattle and vegetables for planting. Today, once again, Olim trusts that his loan will be approved and he will be able to improve his business with the purchase of cattle and farm supplies to plant.   \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She works at the business for 8  hours per day, 7 days per week, and she is assisted by one employee. Amina currently earns about US$170 from her business. She is requesting a loan of US$450 in order to purchase more equipment for her salon such as  a hair drier, weavings, and hair tonic. In the future, she plans to increase her equipment and have a better quality office. Amina thanks you for your support!\r\n\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility.

Muhamadali also provides transportation services on his truck. \n\nMuhamadali dreams of his children becoming educated people, and he is working hard toward this end.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to epic mountain passes, communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 percent of the country is mountainous and only 7 percent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

children.  Because he does not hold a permanent job, Fatto is involved in buying and selling livestock at local markets.  His wife stays at home and helps her husband.  She brings unsold livestock home from the markets.  She also feeds the livestock and takes care of it until Fatto sells it at the next market.  Fatto wants to expand his business and requested this loan from MicroInvest in order to purchase additional livestock and increase his profits.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Russian by Anna Sorokina-Hailey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":325244,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Business expansion","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Isfara","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"40.116667 70.633333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":47,"posted_date":"2009-05-30T00:20:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Fatto","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-05-04T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":2300,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":249.61},{"due_date":"2009-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":259.59},{"due_date":"2009-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":269.98},{"due_date":"2009-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":280.78},{"due_date":"2009-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":292.01},{"due_date":"2009-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":303.69},{"due_date":"2009-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":315.84},{"due_date":"2010-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":328.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.69},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.08},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.56},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.14},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":69.83},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.62},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75.53},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":78.55}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":59.69,"local_amount":249.61,"processed_date":"2009-06-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:56:21Z","rounded_local_amount":258.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52994698},{"amount":62.08,"local_amount":259.59,"processed_date":"2009-07-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-06T10:56:59Z","rounded_local_amount":268.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63215927},{"amount":64.56,"local_amount":269.98,"processed_date":"2009-08-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-10T10:22:28Z","rounded_local_amount":279.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73645405},{"amount":67.14,"local_amount":280.78,"processed_date":"2009-09-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-14T09:13:22Z","rounded_local_amount":290.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87085027},{"amount":69.83,"local_amount":292.01,"processed_date":"2009-10-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-04T09:28:00Z","rounded_local_amount":302.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97001249},{"amount":72.62,"local_amount":303.69,"processed_date":"2009-11-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-25T09:21:46Z","rounded_local_amount":314.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103846398},{"amount":75.53,"local_amount":315.84,"processed_date":"2009-12-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-10T08:42:15Z","rounded_local_amount":327.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110737394},{"amount":78.55,"local_amount":328.5,"processed_date":"2010-01-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-06T08:21:23Z","rounded_local_amount":340.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118127081}],"funded_date":"2009-05-31T17:23:04Z","paid_date":"2010-04-06T08:21:23Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Anna Sorokina","image":null}},{"id":115245,"name":"Ermilita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ermilita C. is from the barangay (village) of Napilan, Sapang Dalaga Misamis Occidental.

Additionally, five years ago she started selling food in front of her house, which is located on a very busy street in her town. She sells food preferably on weekends and on street market days. In order to do so, she prepares the traditional foods that are most popular with her patrons. For this business, she has the help of her husband and one of her daughters who is always with her. The rest of the weekdays, she makes handicrafts to distribute them to vendors. In the future, Olinda would like to continue her food business, but in a business space where she can set up a restaurant to sell regional cuisine permanently. This is the third time that she requests a loan from MFP. She is a team-player who perseveres so that she can obtain good results. Thus, she commits to once again cooperate with her microfinance institute. The money that she is requesting will be used to purchase the ingredients (wholesale) that she needs to prepare her meals. She will also obtain new benches and chairs for her patrons.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Elizabeth Casian, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":355135,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Purchase food and furniture for her business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"HUANCAYO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.066667 -75.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-07-21T07:00:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Olinda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-06-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2009-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2009-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2009-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2009-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2009-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2010-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2010-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2010-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2010-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":300}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":100,"local_amount":300,"processed_date":"2009-07-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:43:49Z","rounded_local_amount":301,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63212046},{"amount":100,"local_amount":300,"processed_date":"2009-08-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:26:43Z","rounded_local_amount":301,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73641581},{"amount":100,"local_amount":300,"processed_date":"2009-09-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:39:13Z","rounded_local_amount":301,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87081021},{"amount":100,"local_amount":300,"processed_date":"2009-10-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:13:01Z","rounded_local_amount":301,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96997171},{"amount":600,"local_amount":1800,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:56:28Z","rounded_local_amount":1806.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103842515}],"funded_date":"2009-07-26T11:46:51Z","paid_date":"2009-12-15T13:56:28Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Elizabeth Casian","image":845142}},{"id":127533,"name":"Thelma","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Thelma B.

They live in Batey Caimito, a beautiful community in the hills of the east-central region of the Dominican Republic. A batey is a community of sugarcane field workers in the rural areas of the Dominican Republic. Bateyes are very remote, hard to access, and most people live in deep poverty. They often lack potable water, medicine, and any kind of reliable electricity.\n\nIn order to feed her family and send her children to school, Olga sells used clothing to her community. Typically, packs of used clothes will arrive from the United States, and Olga will buy them to sell for a profit. She will also use this loan to purchase charcoal, a valuable commodity in a community without reliable electricity. \n\nOlga hopes that she will be able to send her two boys to university, giving them a step up in society.

Haydee was able to attend school until the fifth level of secondary school.    She has 3 children, but only two are still dependent on her for financial support.   Haydee makes and sells shoes for women and children.  She started with slippers, which in her opinion are the easiest to make and to sell.  Later, she began making sandals, dress shoes, and now children's shoes.   With her first loan, she purchased materials needed to make her shoes, such as canvas, fasteners and rubber amongst other things.  With the new loan, she will purchase new materials such as leather, heels, soles, etc,  to make more shoes and slippers.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is forty-eight years old and a mother of six children, all male. Four of her children are currently in school. The first two have completed junior high school and are yet to continue. Adiza lives with her husband and children in a town called Offinso in the Ashanti Region of Ghana. Her husband is a farmer. He cultivates food crops such as maize, plantains, and vegetables to provide food for the family. <P>\r\n\r\nAdiza enjoys trading and has been selling for over fifteen years in the town where she lives. She sells food items like beans, maize, groundnuts, and all kinds of cereals and grains. She buys her goods from the farmers in her locality and the surrounding towns. At times, Adiza travels all the way to the northern part of the country to procure goods at affordable prices. She sells to the people of her locality, most of whom are food vendors.

Su puesto es muy concurrido y debido a la carism\u00e1tica forma de vender que tiene, sus clientes siempre se van muy contentos y felices con su compra. Lo que m\u00e1s le gusta de su trabajo es vender su producto y terminar con la cantidad prevista. Lleva 8 a\u00f1os en esta actividad y lo m\u00e1s dif\u00edcil es tener que permanecer todo el d\u00eda en su puesto de venta sin poder salir a ning\u00fan lugar. Para el futuro desea hacer crecer su negocio y mejorar sus ingresos, sabe que el camino a sus metas es largo y sacrificado, pero est\u00e1 dispuesta a recorrerlo. Este es el segundo pr\u00e9stamo de Elicia con MFP, y sabe que tiene que pagar todas sus cuotas a tiempo, en su banco comunal es una socia muy responsable, siempre est\u00e1 al tanto de los acuerdos a los que llegan en las reuniones. Con los mil quinientos soles solicitados planea comprar m\u00e1s hojas de coca, para aumentar la mercader\u00eda que vende normalmente.","en":"Elicia is a very responsible and loving mother to her 3 children: Soledad, age 10, Rosmeri, age 8, and Rodrigo, 11 months.  She lives in her own house, and what she wishes for the most is to provide her children with good educations.  Her stall is located in the Laguna Temporal esplanade (site where the markets in Juliaca take place).  She sells the well-known sacred leaf of the Incas, in other words, coca leaves (typically chewed or brewed like tea).  Her stall is very busy and, given her charismatic way of selling, her customers always leave content with their purchases.  What she enjoys the most about her work is selling her product, and ending the day with her predicted number of sales.  She has been doing this activity for 8 years, and the most difficult part is staying in her stall all day without leaving.  For the future, she hopes to grow her business to improve her income.  She knows the road to get to her goals is long and will require sacrifices, but she is prepared to take it.  This is Elicia\u2019s second loan with MFP, and she knows that she has to make her payments on time.  She is a very responsible member of her cooperative bank, and she always enjoys the reunions.  She plans to use the 1500 soles she is requesting to buy more coca leaves, so she can increase the amount of product she has to sell.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Mary Lynn Malaby,

Gulbazor is 47 years old. She is the loving mother of three children. In order to help her husband support the large family, Gulbazor and her husband started their own business. So for the last 14 years, Gulbazor has been selling curtains. She has got her own sales point located in one of the local markets. Being a very friendly and polite person by nature, Gulbazor grew her clientele very quickly. The business is stable, generating the main income for the family. \r\n\r\nToday Gulbazor is planning to increase her working capital in order to expand her business. She needs additional funds for purchasing new styles of curtains to sell. With this purpose in mind, Gulbazor requests 8000 Somoni. Gulbazor has received loans from IMON several times and has proved herself a reliable client. She thanks all for their support and promises to be accurate in loan repayment.       \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

His wife helps him with the work, but during the harvest season, he needs laborers to facilitate the gathering and transporting of his products to the local collection centers.

Nadezhda has finished school with high marks and dreamed of studying further, but her mother was unable give to her daughter a higher education. Nadezhda finished beauty school and found work with an established hairstylist.  She helped her mother raise her younger sister and brother.  A year later, she met her husband and became the mother of two daughters. Unfortunately, the marriage did not work out, and after five years, Nadezhda became the sole support for her family. To support her children, she started to bake pies and to distribute them in the village of Kemin, supplying them to shops and kiosks which has allowed her to create a loyal customer base.  Also, Nadezhda continued working as a beautician.   On her small verandah, she does hair and manicures for her neighbors.  A bit more than a year ago, while coming home from distributing pies, Nadezhda found an abandoned newborn baby near her house. After considering it and consulting her daughters, they decided not to give the baby to an orphanage, but instead to adopt her.  Now Nadezhda\u2019s small daughter gives faith, pleasure and happiness to the entire family.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, since 1991 Nadezhda and her older daughters have raised pigs. In September 2009, Nadezhda applied for her first loan from Bai Tushum and received 70,000 KGS. The money helped Nadezhda increase her livestock and to maintain their living areas.  Keeping pigs has provided an income, but the growing requirements of the children mean she must expand the business and become more profitable. So Nadezhda has decided take out a second loan to expand her farm.  Nadezhda plans to take out the second loan for 120,000 KGS to buy more pigs.  Nadezhda is a goal-oriented, persistent person who is doing everything she can to get her children on their feet and give them a good education.\r\n\r\nBai-Tushum and Partners uses Kiva funding to target the especially vulnerable population.

As for the manioc, it is sold retail at the San market, from home and door-to-door for cash or credit.\r\n\r\nDuring this loan cycle, each member of the group expects to make an average profit of 65,000 FCFA, which will be used to repay the loan interest, provide for the needs of the extended family and the remainder will be invested in the business.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Alison Dent, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":296632,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"To buy smoked fish and manioc","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Koutiala","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2009-04-01T07:00:54Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":525,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hawa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mariam ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mariam ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Assan ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mamou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-03-03T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":250000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2009-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2009-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":41666.67,"processed_date":"2009-04-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:27:47Z","rounded_local_amount":43526.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36033763},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":41666.67,"processed_date":"2009-05-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:38:20Z","rounded_local_amount":43526.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44621135},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":41666.67,"processed_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:20:54Z","rounded_local_amount":43526.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53020098},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":41666.67,"processed_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T19:18:39Z","rounded_local_amount":43526.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63242851},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":41666.67,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T19:23:47Z","rounded_local_amount":43526.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63242852},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":41666.65,"processed_date":"2009-08-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T22:46:51Z","rounded_local_amount":43526.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73678487}],"funded_date":"2009-04-02T16:59:25Z","paid_date":"2009-09-15T22:46:51Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":102989,"name":"Lien's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Li\u00ean L\u00ea Th\u1ecb was born in 1958.

She lives in her own home with her dear children, 9-year-old N\u00e9stor and 4-month-old Karen. She is willing to work hard to give them a good education.<br>\r\nElizabeth makes a living purchasing, raising and selling pigs. Her pigs are in high demand in the markets since they are always very big and well-fed. She gets up early every day to feed her pigs what they need to grow. She looks after them with much affection since she knows that thanks to them she\u2019ll have money to support her family. Her 5 years in this business have given her the necessary experience to do her job well.<br> \r\nWhat she most likes about her work is being able to look after her household while watching over the pigs. In the future, she hopes to raise a larger number of pigs. The most difficult part of her job is keeping her animals from straying too far and getting lost.

She alone tries to cover the expenses of her two children; she lives with them in a small house which is still under construction. \r\n\r\nHer talent with sewing machines opened the doors for her to work in various textile workshops of her district. Now she is working in partnership with her sister; both of them receive and fill orders from factories in the city center. \r\n\r\nSilvia believes that the profitability of her business depends on producing new designs to offer to the manufacturers, since she and her sister receive additional income for their designs and creations. During the past 5 years in her business, she has enjoyed the process of designing a range of clothing items. However, the most difficult part of her job is the finishing work, since there are hundreds of garments and the work affects her eyesight.  \r\n\r\nFor the future, Silvia plans to install a workshop with new machines which will make her work at home easier. \r\n\r\nThis is Silvia's first loan with PRISMA Microfinances, and she has made a commitment to work hard and not to abuse the confidence that has been placed in her and her work. With the funds she is requesting, she will purchase the necessary sewing supplies so that she can continue working and delivering her orders promptly. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by

She owns a business venture, planting & harvesting taro for sale.  Ape has 1 year of experience in this business.  Ape needs a loan of WST $1000 to purchase weed-killers such as Gramoxome.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 300 talas or US $125 per week) to financially support immediate members of her family.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Ape rejoined the SPBD program so that she can financially support her business in regards of her request for a small loan. This is her 1st loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Ape's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:*                1.6 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              2 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         2 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\"\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

She has three children of 11, 8 and 4 years of age, all students in elementary school. Her husband is a mechanic but is also working as a security guard in the neighborhood at night due to the increase in the crime rate; this way he earns some extra money to be able to cover the expenses with his wife. Ms. Teresa is dedicated to the sale of beef and pork. She lives in the Santa Elena neighborhood in the northern highway, where she lives close to a butcher where she buys good quality meat at lower prices. She has been selling for over 3 years. She has had to endure some hardship when a child gets ill and she uses up part of her capital and ends up having less funds to purchase meat. She wishes to be able to invest in inventory and earn more money. With this loan she will purchase more meat, a pig and sacks of corn to be able to make tortillas since she wishes to save some money to be able to improve the quality of her home since it is not safe, just covered in zinc, planks and earth, so she is hoping that she will be able to live more comfortably and to improve the hygiene of her family.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Esteban Riojas, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":470515,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Butcher Shop","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"purchase meat, a pig and sacks of corn","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Managua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.150833 -86.268333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":98,"posted_date":"2010-01-15T20:20:18Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":250,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Reyna Teresa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-01-14T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":5000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2010-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2010-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2010-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2010-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2010-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":833.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.66},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.66},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":42.12,"local_amount":842.43,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T07:53:12Z","rounded_local_amount":879.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123841575},{"amount":41.9,"local_amount":837.9,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T07:49:48Z","rounded_local_amount":874.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128874500},{"amount":41.89,"local_amount":837.8,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T09:30:04Z","rounded_local_amount":874.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136604371},{"amount":42.07,"local_amount":841.32,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T08:31:12Z","rounded_local_amount":878.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144639841},{"amount":82.02,"local_amount":1640.55,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:00:42Z","rounded_local_amount":1712.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151821620}],"funded_date":"2010-01-15T22:18:36Z","paid_date":"2010-07-15T09:00:42Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Esteban Riojas","image":812572}},{"id":172964,"name":"Warlito","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Warlito tills 2 hectares of rice field.
