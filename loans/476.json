It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists, and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She has three children that are 12, 10 and 8 years old. All of her children study in a city school. Her husband works in construction and is a master mason. They do not have their own home so they rent. \r\n\r\nMaria is a private employee which she has been doing for 5 years. She works from Monday to Friday from 8:00 a.m. until 4:00 p.m. and at her home she raises animals such as guinea pigs, chickens and cattle. These animals are for her consumption and for sale. \r\n\r\nThis is her third loan with the community bank. She was invited by a neighbor who is an active member of the bank. She will purchase cattle with the money from her loan. Her goal is to finish her home as it is currently under construction.

She has already received and successfully repaid five loans from Patan BPW and used her most recent loan to increase the inventory of her store.  In the future, Muniya plans to uplift the economic condition of her family.  She thanks you for your support.  In the Kathmandu Valley, a small grocery store, called a pasal, is an important part of the local economy.  Fresh produce, milk, and staples such as rice, lentils, and flour are purchased daily for cooking in the home.

They are adult and in one way or another contribute to the family expenses. Teresa lives in the district of Calleria, in the city of Pucallpa. She is lucky enough to have her own house. Teresa has sold cold drinks and desserts from her house for several years. She has the help of her children who do the selling while she goes out to offer other products that she sells as well. What she likes the most about her job is that she has direct contact with the customers and it is a source of income for her budget. What she doesn't like is being exposed to the heat when she cooks the blue corn and gelatin and that has led her to suffer from some health problems that bother her. She likes this activity since she has customers every day. She hopes to be able to buy a refrigerator since the one she works with is her son's who moved away some months ago and now Teresa is borrowing it. This is the fifth loan that Teresa has had with MFP and she feels good in the group since when there have been problems they overcame them like the group they are.

Tajikistan and IMON International\n\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need. To learn more about IMON International's work, please visit: www.imon.tj\n","en":"Islom has more than twenty years of experience in auto repair. His son helped him with the business, but his son went to Russia to work as a builder. The first time his son sent money home, the money was spent on Islom's daughter's wedding. When his children were two and three years old, his wife abandoned the family, and since then Islom and his mother have brought up the children by themselves. Islom dreams of sending his son to college so that, like other children, he could receive an appropriate education. Islom is asking for a loan to buy equipment so that he may better repair cars.

Hoy vende en su punto comercial ranchos, v\u00edveres, \u00fatiles de aseo personal y en general todos los art\u00edculos de la canasta familiar al detalle a amas de casa que se re\u00fanen, conversan y compran en la tienda de Nevys.\nNevys es una joven emprendedora que con su iniciativa generadora de ingreso, ha logrado salir adelante, pese a su condici\u00f3n de hu\u00e9rfana de padre y as\u00ed mismo apoya a su familia y logra sostener su negocio. Ella planea verlo crecer permanentemente y por eso trabaja cada d\u00eda con el mayor empe\u00f1o. Esta es la raz\u00f3n por la cual acude a su credikiva, primer financiamiento que hace a la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, con la cual comprar\u00e1 en mayor cantidad, v\u00edveres, refrescos, \u00fatiles de aseo y papeler\u00eda, que es lo que usualmente solicitan sus clientes en esta primera temporada escolar del a\u00f1o.  Su meta es tener una casa para adecuar su negocio con toda la tecnolog\u00eda y modernidad de su juventud. Mientras esto  ocurre se esmera trabajando y con ello obtiene una rentabilidad promedia sobre las ventas, no menor del 28%, sus inventarios rotan cada 14 d\u00edas y sus cuentas por cobrar cada 5 d\u00edas, porque la mayor cantidad de art\u00edculos los vende de contado y maneja unos pocos cr\u00e9ditos con clientes rentables, con los cuales sostiene buenas relaciones. \n\n\n","en":"Nevys, while still a young woman of 19, already has her own business.  When she was 14, she decided to become a retailer, and had two initial experiences which led her to undertake her business venture of a store.  Today her store sells food, personal grooming products, and in general all the specific items a family needs.  She sells to housewives who meet together, chat and make their purchases at Nevys' store.\r\n\r\nNevys is an entrepreneurial young woman who generates income through her initiative.  She has managed to move ahead in life in spite of being orphaned, and so has supported her family and managed to keep her business going.  She plans to see it grow permanently, and for this reason she works on a daily basis with maximum determination.  \r\n\r\nThis is the reason why she has come for a Kiva loan; her first financing through Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  With the loan, she will purchase a greater quantity of food, beverages, personal grooming products, and paper goods, which are what her customers normally look for at this first school season of  the year.\r\n\r\nHer goal is to have a house where she can use all the technology and modernity of her youth in her business.  In the meantime, she strives to work, and with her work she earns an average profit on her sales of not less than 28%, her inventory turns over every two weeks. and her accounts receivables is at 5 days.  This is because she sells the great majority of items for cash, and provides credit to only a few, profitable customers with whom she has good relations."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":985247,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to purchase a greater quantity of food, beverages, personal grooming products and paper goods.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Soledad Atl\u00e0ntico","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2012-01-20T21:00:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":600,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nevys Johanna","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-12T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1070000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":166546},{"due_date":"2012-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":172096},{"due_date":"2012-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":176112},{"due_date":"2012-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":180221},{"due_date":"2012-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":184426},{"due_date":"2012-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":190599}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.39},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.5},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":98.76},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":101.06},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":103.41},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.88}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":93.39,"local_amount":166546,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:34:43Z","rounded_local_amount":171501.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263325111},{"amount":96.5,"local_amount":172096,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T09:31:02Z","rounded_local_amount":177217.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270039170},{"amount":98.76,"local_amount":176112,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:43:02Z","rounded_local_amount":181352.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276651303},{"amount":101.06,"local_amount":180221,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T15:55:24Z","rounded_local_amount":185583.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283140911},{"amount":210.29,"local_amount":375025,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:36:37Z","rounded_local_amount":386184.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294338428}],"funded_date":"2012-01-21T08:03:03Z","paid_date":"2012-08-15T09:36:37Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Arabella Pollack","image":null}},{"id":472474,"name":"Lolo Group","description":{"languages":["fr"],"texts":{"fr":"Les quatre membres du groupe   LOLO   sont des femmes mari\u00e9es ayant une moyenne d\u2019\u00e2ge de 32 ans,   3 enfants et  vivant la plupart dans des  familles monogames au quartier BABEMBA un des quartiers populaires de la ville de Sikasso. \nElles sont \u00e0 leur dixi\u00e8me pr\u00eat avec l\u2019institution de microfinance Soro Yiriwaso, dans le souci de satisfaire le besoin de leur client\u00e8le.\nAFOU fait le commerce de pagnes wax dans ce groupe de femmes.

The only way to reach this location is by travelling to the Palestina canton by a microbus, before walking for 45 minutes.  However, when I went there for the interview, I had to walk another 45 minutes in the rain, as the bus driver didn't reach Palestina, and so I had to walk to the center of Santa Clara.  This was an incredible experience, as I was walking through the green mountains surrounded by a deep calm.  \r\n<p>\r\nAll of the Lucianitas manufacture belts from beads.  These belts are used by indigenous women to decorate their materials or long skirts.  The Lucianitas sell the belts to traders who come to Paquip to collect the goods.  Together with their respective families, this group of women work very hard to earn their daily bread.  \r\nEach belt sells at US$6 and it takes one person a whole day to produce one belt.\r\n<p>\r\nThese women usually work alone and are helped by their daughters after they arrive home from school and do their homework.  In Paquip, all girls start producing these belts from the age of 9.\r\n<p>\r\nThe Lucianitas have been working together for 6 years.  During this time, the clients have achieved a unique harmony.  This harmony is due to the courtesy of the women.  Furthermore, all of these years they have felt very comfortable with the credit agent Gloria Cholotio and also with The Friendship Bridge.  They say that they like the Friendship Bridge because an alternative local loan would be very expensive, with monthly fees of up to 10%.\r\n<p>\r\nThe dream of the Lucianitas is to see their childR. complete school and maybe even university.  They all support their childrens' education.  They see that their childR. have the opportunity to get an education that they never had.  It's because of this that they blindly support the development of their families and we really ought to do the same.\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from [Spanish] by [Lisa Ritchie], Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n<P>Las Lucianitas provienen D. la aldea Paquip ubicada en el municipio D. Santa Clara. La \u00fanica manera D. llegar a este lugar es llegar al cant\u00f3n D. Palestina en un microb\u00fas y luego caminar por 15 minutos. Sin embargo cuando yo fui a la entrevista tuve que caminar 45 minutos bajo la lluvia, ya que el conductor D. los microbuses no llegaron a Palestina y tuve que caminar hasta el centro D. Santa Clara. Esta fue una experiencia realmente incre\u00edble ya que estaba caminando al medio D. las monta\u00f1as verdes rodeado por una paz \u00fanica. \r\n\r\n<P>Todas las Lucianitas elaboran cinturones a base D. mostacilla. Estos cinturones son utilizados por las mujeres ind\u00edgenas para adornar sus cortes o faldas largas. Ellas venden sus cinturones a los intermediarios que vienen a Paquip a recoger la mercader\u00eda. Junto con sus respectivas familias este grupo D. mujeres trabajan muy duro para ganarse el pan D. cada d\u00eda. Para elaborar un cintur\u00f3n una persona se demora un d\u00eda entero y venden cada uno a US$6. Lamentablemente, el intermediario se lleva gran parte D. la ganancia. \r\n\r\n<P>Usualmente estas mujeres trabajan solas y cuando sus hijas llegan del colegio las ayudan a elaborar las cintas despu\u00e9s D. hacer sus tareas. En Paquip todas las ni\u00f1as empiezan a elaborar estos cinturones desD. que tienen 9 a\u00f1os D. edad. \r\n\r\n<P>Las Lucianitas han venido trabajando juntos por 6 a\u00f1os. Durante este tiempo las clientas han logrado una armon\u00eda \u00fanica. Esta armon\u00eda se debe a que todas las se\u00f1oras son cumplidas. Adem\u00e1s, todos estos a\u00f1os ellas se han sentido muy c\u00f3modas con la agente D. cr\u00e9dito Gloria Cholotio y con la instituci\u00f3n. Ellas dicen que les gusta Friendship Bridge porque un prestamista local les cobra muy caro, esto pueD. llegar hasta un 10% al mes. \r\n\r\n<P>El sue\u00f1o D. las Lucianitas es D. ver a sus hijos graduarse del colegio y porque no la universidad. Todas ellas apoyan la educaci\u00f3n D. sus hijos. Ellas sienten que sus hijos tienen la oportunidad D. educarse que ellas no tuvieron o no le ofrecieron. Es por eso que ellas ciegamente apoyan el desarrollo D. sus familias y \u00a1nosotros deber\u00edamos D. hacer lo mismo!"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3025,"image":{"id":172892,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"To

She had no way to provide for herself and for her mother, who is dependent on her. At first, she ran a stationer's out of her house, taking advantage of the fact that her street is a very busy one; then she expanded the range of items she sold to include household products and cosmetics. After a while, an aunt of hers convinced her to start selling gold jewelery in the run up to Valentine's day. Lourdes took her advice and her jewelery business took off. Necklaces and bracelets came into fashion, and she sold many kinds. She also began to read up on how to make jewelery, and really enjoys the process. Now she makes many pieces herself.  Since her jewelery business has grown, she has also added other products to her stock. Now, to complement the jewelery, she offers other kinds of gifts and novelty items. In this way, she can have various streams of income and won't be completely dependent on jewelery sales. Lourdes needs a loan of $10,000 pesos, which she will repay in 12 installments, so that she can buy supplies she needs to make bags, bracelets, necklaces, rings, etc. She wants to have lots to offer this Valentine's day and she wants to be able to help people give their friends gifts. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Sara Sultan, Kiva

Nasreen baji is the mother of two children, one son and one daughter who are in school. Nasreen baji sews clothes to pay for her children's school fees because her husband\u2019s income barely meets the financial expenses of the household. She is requesting a loan to change the body of her husband\u2019s auto-rickshaw (a local three-wheeled motor vehicle) so he can continue to earn his income.\r\n\r\nShe is the group leader of a group with four other women. Shagufta baji requests a loan to buy fertilizer to sell. Gaman baji requests a loan to buy a donkey cart. Bashiran baji requests a loan to buy scrap for her scrap business. Rukhsana baji requests a loan to buy a buffalo for her animal-selling business.\r\n\r\nThis is a group loan. The loan funds will be distributed among the group members, each of whom will invest in her own business. The members mutually guarantee one another's loans.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":364449,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bricks","sector":"Construction","themes":null,"use":"To expand her business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mwanza","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.516667 32.9","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-08-06T04:00:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Asha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-08-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2010-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":80}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-09-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T02:45:36Z","rounded_local_amount":105880,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87105850},{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-10-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T06:26:24Z","rounded_local_amount":105880,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97022960},{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-11-18T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:41:36Z","rounded_local_amount":105880,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103868201},{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-12-18T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T16:44:31Z","rounded_local_amount":105880,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110757397},{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2010-01-17T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:34:26Z","rounded_local_amount":105880,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118146491}],"funded_date":"2009-08-06T16:44:33Z","paid_date":"2010-02-15T12:34:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"June Blender","image":123338}},{"id":131311,"name":"Georges","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Georges K. vend des poules et porcs \u00e0 Kisangani.

is a single mother who raises her three children alone. She works hard to ensure a decent livelihood for her small family. Gavharjon started her small business 8 years ago when the clothing sales business was only getting started in Tajikistan. Even today, there is still little competition at the market where she sells her inventories. This business is her family's only income. Gavharjon has used business loans before and finds them very helpful. This time she is requesting a loan of 7000 Somoni to increase the variety of items she offers. Gavharjon hopes to restock her kiosk and make it more profit.\r\n \r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Her long term goals are to have a full-fledged sewing business and to buy a tricycle, a three-wheeled-vehicle used as public transportation. She and her husband want to offer a good transport business in their village. The couple believes that having their own tricycle would be a good additional income source.

She is 40 years old. Elena is married and has two school-aged children. To make a living, Elena owns & operates a business raising crops. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from planting and harvesting rice for sale. Elena has been engaged in her business for over 10 years and earns approximately 3000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Elena joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Elena has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5000 PHP from GDMPC. Elena is requesting a new loan of 6000 PHP, which will be used to purchase fertilizer. This loan will be the second loan taken out by Elena from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay the tuition fees for her children. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three unit offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Ruth has been selling prepared meals and fried snacks for six years.  She started this business because she needed to support her three children as a single mother.  Ruth is 46 years old and lives in the neighborhood of Laurles Norte.  Two of her wishes are to provide for her children\u2019s education and have better working conditions.  Currently the area of her home where she sells her products does not have a roof.  She wants to buy sheets of zinc and metal crossbeams so that her business is more presentable to her customers, and thereby allows her to provide better service.  \r\n<p>\r\nSales are lower during the winter because of the rainy season.  Ruth has no other place to conduct business and she is worried because she still has to pay her water, electricity, and food bills.  Installing a roof will enable her to continue selling food throughout the year so that she can generate income to cover both her personal necessities and her monthly loan payments.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":433468,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Catering","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Purchase materials to install a roof over her business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Managua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.150833 -86.268333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":98,"posted_date":"2009-11-25T21:10:17Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":725,"lender_count":4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ruth Belina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-11-14T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":15000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2010-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2010-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2010-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2010-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2010-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2010-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2010-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2010-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.64}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":80.56},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.55},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.56},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.55},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.56},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.55},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.56},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.56},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.55}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":90.49,"local_amount":1872.26,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T10:56:37Z","rounded_local_amount":1875.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110601886},{"amount":77.52,"local_amount":1603.95,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T09:52:41Z","rounded_local_amount":1606.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118003252},{"amount":167.18,"local_amount":3458.94,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T07:49:51Z","rounded_local_amount":3465.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128874324},{"amount":76.69,"local_amount":1586.6,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T09:30:57Z","rounded_local_amount":1589.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136604216},{"amount":81.12,"local_amount":1678.38,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:01:08Z","rounded_local_amount":1681.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151821457},{"amount":162.74,"local_amount":3367.09,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T09:03:41Z","rounded_local_amount":3373.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159561468},{"amount":69.26,"local_amount":1432.78,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T09:17:51Z","rounded_local_amount":1435.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166770423}],"funded_date":"2009-11-25T21:59:53Z","paid_date":"2010-09-15T09:17:51Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ronan Reodica","image":498323}},{"id":160216,"name":"Efren","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Efren T. runs a <i>sari-sari<\/i> (variety retail store).

One of them now works for a living.\r\n\r\nA residential ready-to-wear (RTW) business is what Fedelina works on for more than five years now. She buys quality shirts, bags, pants, and shoes, and sells them to business acquaintances and neighbors. But aside from that, she also focuses on her piggery. She raises piglets and makes sure they grow healthy to produce good pork products. Monthly, she earns around Php 11,000 from these two businesses.\r\n\r\nTo help Fedelina continue operation of her business, she would like to apply for a Php 16,000.  She plans to use this loan to buy hog feeds and other materials needed to sustain her piggery even as the piglets are still being raised.  She also plans to use this loan in buying quality Ready-to-Wear products which will suit the tastes of her regular customers.\r\n\r\nFrustrations never cease to exist even in the life of Fedelina, but she chooses to focus on her goal rather than on the obstacles.

He hires day laborers when it's time to clean his fields and get rid of the brush and also for the harvest.

The hardwood trees will also contribute to nature because they give us life; that's the motto that he uses when planting trees.

During all this time she\u2019s learned quite a bit because when she started out she didn\u2019t know anything because she\u2019d never worked at this type of activity before.  She enjoys her work very much because she can manage her own time and also generate income for her home without having to leave home.  Before starting this business she depended on her spouse\u2019s income but now she can earn extra income and contribute to her household\u2019s economy.

Juana is very talented when it comes to knitting, and every day she creates beautiful pieces.  She began knitting when she was ten years old, because her brothers noticed her talent and pushed her to try to sell her pieces.  With practice, she has improved a lot and can now make her garments much more quickly.   Her skill and talent have enabled her to get through times of economic difficulty that her family has suffered on many occasions, when their income was not enough to cover the costs of 4 children and their education.  <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p> Juana's husband is a bricklayer, and often times his work is seasonal.   For this reason, Juana sometimes sells her garments in front of schools and cinemas around the city.   She also has plans to build a chicken coop and acquire more chickens to sell.  Right now they keep chickens in the house, using them for their own consumption.  She hopes to achieve her goals and is requesting a loan to invest in more wool, as well as a number of chickens for the coop she'd like to build.   She appreciates your support. <\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\nEl arte de tejer se materializa finamente en las manos de Juana, qui\u00e9n cada d\u00eda con dedicaci\u00f3n elabora bellos trabajos de tejido a  crochet; ella viene tejiendo desde hace diez a\u00f1os porque sus hermanos al observar su  talento  la animaron a que se dedique para  comercializar lo que produce d\u00eda a d\u00eda. Ya con la pr\u00e1ctica ha mejorado y tiene mayor velocidad al tejer sus prendas  y es as\u00ed que produce con sus bellos tejidos a crochet chalinas, ropones para beb\u00e9s y fustanes de lana.Este talento que  posee le ha permitido superar los tiempos de crisis econ\u00f3mica que su familia ha sufrido en muchas ocasiones  en que los  ingresos econ\u00f3micos han sido insuficientes para cubrir los gastos de manutenci\u00f3n de sus cuatro hijos que est\u00e1n en edad escolar.  Su esposo es un humilde alba\u00f1il y muchas veces los trabajos son  temporales es por ello que tambi\u00e9n , Juana, en ocasiones vende canchita en bolsa en las puertas de algunas escuelas y tambi\u00e9n los cines de su ciudad.Tiene planes de  construir  una peque\u00f1a granja de pollos que por el momento s\u00f3lo mantiene en casa para consumo familiar. Todos estos deseos espera cumplirlos con perseverancia y ayuda del talento que posee y solicita un pr\u00e9stamo para invertirlos en la  compra de lana y de una cantidad considerable de gallinas para la granja que desea implementar en casa.Juana agradece tu noble deseo  de apoyarla.\r\n\r\n<p> Translated by Kiva volunteer, Emily Charnes <\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":86364,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Weaving","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"TO PURCHASE WOOL FOR THE GARMENTS SHE KNITS AND SELLS, AS WELL MATERIALS FOR A CHICKEN THEY WANT TO BUILD BEHIND THEIR SMALL HOUSE","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"HUANCAYO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.066667 -75.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2007-11-24T19:55:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"lender_count":3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-12-08T21:02:16Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1200,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":133.33},{"due_date":"2008-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":133.33},{"due_date":"2008-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":133.33},{"due_date":"2008-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":133.33},{"due_date":"2008-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":133.33},{"due_date":"2008-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":133.33},{"due_date":"2008-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":133.33},{"due_date":"2008-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":133.33},{"due_date":"2008-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":133.36}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":47.22},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":47.22},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":47.22},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":47.22},{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":47.22},{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":47.22},{"due_date":"2008-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":47.22},{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":47.22},{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":47.24}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":48,"local_amount":135.53,"processed_date":"2008-01-08T10:15:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T01:41:53Z","rounded_local_amount":143.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":112030},{"amount":48,"local_amount":135.53,"processed_date":"2008-02-08T10:15:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T01:41:54Z","rounded_local_amount":143.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":131355},{"amount":48,"local_amount":135.53,"processed_date":"2008-03-08T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T01:41:59Z","rounded_local_amount":143.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":153084},{"amount":48,"local_amount":135.53,"processed_date":"2008-04-08T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T01:42:14Z","rounded_local_amount":143.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177195},{"amount":48,"local_amount":135.53,"processed_date":"2008-05-08T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T01:43:00Z","rounded_local_amount":143.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":204612},{"amount":48,"local_amount":135.53,"processed_date":"2008-06-08T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T01:44:41Z","rounded_local_amount":143.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":231914},{"amount":48,"local_amount":135.53,"processed_date":"2008-07-08T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T01:48:28Z","rounded_local_amount":143.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":261012},{"amount":48,"local_amount":135.53,"processed_date":"2008-08-08T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T01:56:38Z","rounded_local_amount":143.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":289910},{"amount":41,"local_amount":115.76,"processed_date":"2008-09-08T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-09-09T02:15:45Z","rounded_local_amount":122.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":320260}],"funded_date":"2007-11-24T21:02:16Z","paid_date":"2008-09-09T02:15:45Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":28898,"name":"Nguyen Thi","description":{"languages":["vi"],"texts":{"vi":"Mrs. Nguyen Thi H., 43 years old, is living with her husband and 3 children in Nghi Loc, Nghe An.

She intends to borrow 325 USD to buy more unhusked rice.  \r\n<p><b>Translated from Vietnamese by Duy Hua, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nCh\u1ecb Nguy\u1ec5n Th\u1ecb H\u1ea1nh, 43 tu\u1ed5i, hi\u1ec7n \u0111ang s\u1ed1ng c\u00f9ng ch\u1ed3ng v\u00e0 3 con t\u1ea1i Nghi L\u1ed9c, Ngh\u1ec7 An.

Previously, she spent a good amount of time selling clothing as a street vendor in Ayacucho (located in the Peruvian mountains).  Upon moving to Lima with her husband, they decided to continue with this endeavor.  They sold their wares in various locations and always from the street, until they realized the risks in this type of informal activity and decided to more formally establish themselves by renting a location for their business.  Little by little they increased their inventory and, five years ago, they opened their own shop for sportswear.  This gave their business a good boost, although they assure it was not easy, and they have worked very hard to get to what they have today.  <p>\r\n\r\nDespite this, Cirila dreams of more.

She is a single mother of two, and her sons are now financially independent. The family plans to finish construction on their house and to build walls around their plot of land. When the walls are built they'll have the security to obtain a patrimony. Their house is made of planks and zinc, and it's not very safe. Esperanza has started the wall and would like to finish it, because it is important to her family to be safe from crime. Esperanza has worked as a receptionist for the past three years, and her goal is to change jobs so that she can earn more money. This would benefit her family and enable her to achieve her objectives. Thanks to the Afodenic loans she'll be able to buy construction materials like: cement, iron, blocks, zinc and barbed wire.

She and her husband have 4 daughters who attend high school.  Elia sells river fish of all varieties and sizes from her post in the informal market.  Her work schedule runs from 6am to 11am and she has been doing this for the past 9 years.  Occasionally one of her daughters will come with her to help tend to the customers.  What she likes most about her job is that she gets to sell and take good care of people, especially her regular clients.  In addition, her business is very profitable because she earns a daily income and gets better returns because she buys her fish directly from the river port at a lower price.  Elia\u2019s business is doing very well and sometime later she wants to export her product to other places that have not experienced the taste of freshwater fish.  \r\n<p>\r\nElia already has 8 previous loans with MFP.  She loves working with her Communal Bank because all the members are punctual with their payments and understand one another.  She will designate 500 soles to purchase more fish.

Married to M. B., a government employee, they are blessed with five children. She makes sure that she helps her husband earn so that their family can have a better life.  She has been into managing a variety store for quite some time now. She mainly buys and sells basic commodities like groceries, rice and the like to her neighbors.\r\n\r\nLeila has been a regular member of Center for Community Transformation* (CCT) for more than a year now. She regularly attends their weekly fellowship meetings and pays her weekly dues consistently. Because of her good repayment performance with her previous loans, she was able to borrow 10 times in CCT\u2019s Cooperative.  She is consistent in paying her dues because she used the money she borrowed to expand and improve her business.     \r\n\r\nTo ensure the success of her business, she would like to apply for a PHP 13,000 loan. This amount will be used as a source of added capital to her expanding business by buying more stock to be incorporated into her current product inventory.\r\n\r\nShe dreams that her business will continue to grow so that she can provide for her children\u2019s education.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay Micro Finance loans.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":525416,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

Danilo has been engaged in his business for over 15 years and earns approximately 3500 PHP a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Danilo joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Danilo has successfully repaid a previous loan of 7,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase breeding livestock. Danilo is requesting a new loan of 7000 PHP which will be used to purchase livestock feed and other supplies. This loan will be his third loan from ASKI. He plans to use the additional revenue to financially support immediate members of his family. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 38 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Her husband Edno, who is 46 years old, works as a farmer to earn his living and helps in his wife's business activities.  They have six children who are between 6 and 26 years old. Helina joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2006 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past eight loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Helina has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 12,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 11,000, uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her ninth loan, she is borrowing PHP 12,000 to buy stock for her sari-sari (general) store so that she can continue to save up for the future education of her children.

Today, BRAC has emerged as an independent, virtually self-financed paradigm in sustainable human development. It is one of the largest Southern development organizations employing over 100,000 people, 61% of which are women, and working with the twin objectives of poverty alleviation and empowerment of the poor. Diagnosing poverty in human terms and recognizing its multifaceted nature, BRAC approaches poverty alleviation with a holistic approach.\r\n<br><br>The successes of BRAC in the international development arena have stimulated a series of discussions, both with African delegations, who have visited BRAC programs, and with donors who work in Asia and Africa. Both the African countries and the donors have encouraged BRAC to join the development campaign in Africa to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and more recently to join the campaign of \u201cending poverty\u201d, which is an area where Africa represents the greatest global challenge.\r\n<br><br> In Uganda, BRAC registered as a Non Government Organization (NGO) in January 2006 to undertake programs in Education, Health, Water & Sanitation, Agriculture & Livestock and Microfinance. The Microfinance and Education are the pioneer programs launched in Uganda and, as of July 2007, had served 21,273 borrowers and enrolled 1,155 adolescents in its education

Mrs. Sokhom S. is 29 years old and the mother of three children, one of whom is attending the local school, while the others are too young to work or study because they are four and five years old. Her husband is presented on the right in the photo.

vida de sus padres, que son de edad avanzada. Por otro lado este negocio es de mucha ayuda para los vecinos de su caser\u00edo, ya que este queda muy alejado del pueblo y ellos no tienen alimentos de primera necesidad al alcance de la mano.\n\nDebido a que la mayor\u00eda de vecinos de la zona son agricultores y reciben sus pagos los fines de semana ella ofrece sus productos al cr\u00e9dito y al contado. Este sistema esta teniendo mucha acogida, asi que Rosaura desea ampliar su negocio, por este motivo se encuentra solicitando a Edpyme Alternativa un cr\u00e9dito de 1500 nuevos soles que piensa invertir en la compra de mas verduras y menestras.\n\nElla es una mujer bastante conocida por los vecinos de su zona, ellos la consideran una mujer trabajadora, responsable y de confianza.

This business was born out of Rosaura's need to earn a living to help support her family and look after her parents' quality of life, as they are elderly. Concurrently, this business also helps her neighbors in the settlement since the city is far away and they do not have basic need items at hand. <p> \r\nBecause the majority of the residents are farmers and receive their pay at the end of the week, she accepts both cash and credit for her goods. This system is having much success, so Rosaura would like to expand her business. For this reason, she is requesting a 1,500.00 PEN loan from Edpyme Alternativa, which she will invest in purchasing pulses and vegetables. <p>\r\nRosaura is very well-known by her neighbors, who consider her to be a hardworking, responsible and trustworthy woman. Her greatest wish is to give her parents a better quality of life.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Elizabeth Casian, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":507852,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Purchase pulses and vegetables","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Quemaz\u00f3n - M\u00f3rrope - Lambayeque","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":143,"posted_date":"2010-03-18T22:30:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosaura","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":103.47},{"due_date":"2010-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":108.43},{"due_date":"2010-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":107.74},{"due_date":"2010-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":117.96},{"due_date":"2010-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":118.06},{"due_date":"2010-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":120.98},{"due_date":"2010-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":127.82},{"due_date":"2010-11-05T07:00:00Z","amount":130.3},{"due_date":"2010-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":134.65},{"due_date":"2011-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":139.6},{"due_date":"2011-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":143.16},{"due_date":"2011-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":147.83}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.94},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.76},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.5},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.25},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.29},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.36},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.87},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.78},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.37},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.18},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.5},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.2}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":37.94,"local_amount":103.47,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:09:20Z","rounded_local_amount":107.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136662326},{"amount":39.76,"local_amount":108.43,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:07:14Z","rounded_local_amount":112.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144695030},{"amount":39.5,"local_amount":107.74,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:38:26Z","rounded_local_amount":111.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151878075},{"amount":43.25,"local_amount":117.96,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T10:51:01Z","rounded_local_amount":122.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159618103},{"amount":43.29,"local_amount":118.06,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:02:04Z","rounded_local_amount":122.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166832505},{"amount":44.36,"local_amount":120.98,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T09:56:45Z","rounded_local_amount":125.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172099111},{"amount":301.9,"local_amount":823.36,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-16T10:42:24Z","rounded_local_amount":851.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177554552}],"funded_date":"2010-03-19T12:33:14Z","paid_date":"2010-11-16T10:42:24Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Elizabeth Casian","image":845142}},{"id":189555,"name":"Teresa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Teresa, 48, sells charcoal to have an income for her family.

A smiling giant of a woman (she is seen raising her hand on the picture), currently in her 11th loan cycle, she is a 36-year-old widow, the mother of seven children all attending school: four in the primary and three in the secondary school system.\r\n\r\nHer husband passed away 25 January 2005 in Kigali (Rwanda) following a prolonged lung-related illness. She has been the sole support of her children these past five years, which weighs heavily on the rapid expansion of her business.\r\n\r\nHer business is free-style in nature, itinerant without a fixed location. She provides bed sheets, children\u2019s clothing, pagnes and boubous (colourful West-African clothing), and gold jewelry to all who are interested. It has now been five years since she began an activity known as \u201clutte-lutte pita pita\u201d.\r\n\r\nShe used to live in Kigali, where most of her in-laws reside, and following her husband\u2019s death, without any savings, she began weaving clothes and tablecloths, etc. The earnings from this activity (craft) enabled her to move from Rwanda to the Democratic Republic of Congo with her children, where with her remaining $50 she was able to settle in a guesthouse.\r\n\r\nShe started to trade in tomatoes, gasoline, salt, milk, powdered detergent (OMO). Then she learned that the Hekima MFI provided loans without collateral, and she was granted her first reinforcement loan.\r\n\r\nShe had just re-established some financial balance when she became one of many victims of the 8 July 2009 fire that destroyed over 900 homes in Goma, inside the Birere shanty-town.\r\n\r\nWith the Hekima MFI loan Kapinga M. wishes to increase her turnover by buying 6 pairs of bedsheets, a half-dozen gold chains (locally called \u201cGarantie manzanza\u201d), a half-dozen quality dresses from Congo Brazzaville, and six pagnes.\r\n\r\nShe is also an Evangelist acolyte in a local church (Christ is King) and sometimes participates in \u201cSpiritual Combat\u201d, a Christian revivalist ministry.\r\n\r\nShe is comfortable with how her business is going, and in the future envisions buying a plot of land as inheritance for her children and eventually renting out as a property owner. Additionally she hopes to see all of her children finish their studies with diplomas that will serve them in their future.\r\n\r\nKapinga M. thanks the Hekima MFI for the loans she has received without any collateral because that is what enabled her to meet her children\u2019s needs. She was finally able to enjoy relief and financial stability for the first time since her husband\u2019s death, thanks to Hekima\u2019s loans.\r\n\r\nThe Hodari loan group is made up of 15 members, for the most part women.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Ren\u00e9 McConnell, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":5000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":5000,"image":{"id":525421,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":["Conflict Zones"],"use":"6 pairs of bedsheets, 6 guaranteed gold chains, 6 quality dresses from Congo Brazzaville, and 6 pagnes","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CD","country":"Congo (Dem.

He is a cheerful, hard working young man.  He cohabits with Sarita, 18, who is 8 months pregnant.  They live together in their own house where peace and concord reign.\r\n\r\nJhony is a very responsible young man who is very knowledgeable in his work: he\u2019s a farmer.  His parents taught his this occupation when he was quite young and since then he\u2019s worked his own field for the last four years.  He has three hectares producing the following crops: cocoa beans, coffee and bananas.  During harvest time he hires day laborers to help.  He is quite aware that this contribution he\u2019s getting is to produce good quality fruit.  He sells his cocoa beans and coffee in the city of San Francisco because that\u2019s where the best prices for these grains are available.\r\n\r\nWhat he enjoys the most about his work is harvesting because that\u2019s when the long months of hard work bear fruit in the good quality of his crops.  Transporting his products from the fields to the drying spaces is the most difficult part of the job.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She has four children who are all married, and currently cares for two of her granddaughters who live with her.  \r\n\r\nShe tells us that since she was very young, she had to work and it was very difficult since she was a single mother and had to help her children get ahead.  More than 16 years ago, she started to sell cosmetics and perfumes to her friends and neighbors in her community.  First, she shows her catalogs to her customers and they place an order.

completed seven previous loan cycles with Asociacion Arariwa. The twenty group members all live in the city of Cusco and dedicate themselves to a variety of different businesses.\r\n<p>\r\nFernando P. G. is 33 years old and single. He works independently as a systems engineer and works for the international NGO Worldvision, the SIS computing company, and the Hotel San Agustin. His three employers keep him pretty busy as he usually has jobs all through the week. He has been in this line of work for the past six or seven years. Fernando is requesting a loan of $150 to install ceramic tiles on the staircase of his house. He will hire someone to do the job, which will cost 1000 soles in total (US$300); he will pay for the rest of the job out of his salary. This is Fernando\u2019s first loan cycle with the Salud Village Bank.\r\n<p>\r\nFour of the group members work at a local nursery school run by PRONOEI, a government institution that provides daycare\/nursery schooling to children between the ages of 3 and 5 from low-income families. The women are paid very little (one of the women refers to her salary as \u201ca tip\u201d), so they all have side businesses to generate more income. They each earn 300 soles per month (US $95). Hermila V. V. and Maria Elena P. C. both sell stuffed animals at a Saturday market in the Santiago neighborhood of Cusco; each says that on a good day she earns as much as 250 soles in profits.  Filomena C. M. works at the same market selling second hand clothing. She travels to Puno once a week to buy the clothing, and says she earns as much as 300 soles on a good weekend. These three women will invest their Kiva loans in purchasing more merchandise for their respective businesses at the Baratillo market.\r\n<p>\r\nSonia P. H. is 47 years old and married. She has one son who is 15; she also lost a child to medical negligence. She runs a small business with her husband selling communications devices to municipal offices in small towns in the countryside around Cusco. These devices generate radio and television signals. She handles the administrative end of this while her husband is in charge of the technical part.\r\n<p>\r\nThe couple has been in this business for the past 18 years, so they are well known in the area and use word of mouth to advertise their services. Most of the equipment has to be special ordered from Lima or Arequipa, says Sonia, though some of the smaller parts can be found and assembled in Cusco. The couple works alone most of the time, though they occasionally hire someone to work on transmission towers. Sonia will use her loan of $700 to buy part of a larger piece of equipment. $700 is enough to buy the cables and connectors, she says; the entire piece of equipment will cost about $1500. Sonia\u2019s goal for the future is to expand her business from a micro-enterprise to a larger company.\r\n<p>\r\nThe group is requesting a total of $4,400. The members have all pledged to repay their Kiva loans in full and on time. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4400,"image":{"id":305671,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Install ceramic tiles, buy stuffed animals, used clothing, cables and connectors for satellite","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"CUSCO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.518333 -71.978056","type":"point"}},"partner_id":119,"posted_date":"2009-05-01T07:00:32Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":4400,"lender_count":127,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nancy Nicanora","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rocio Luisa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Naciazena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sonia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bilarmina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Elena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Adela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dignidad","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Agripino ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Catalina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Elena ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Filomena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jenny ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kriss Gin","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nayra","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Modesto","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hermila","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fernando ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Hilda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Agripinino","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-04-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":4400,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":4400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1052.27},{"due_date":"2009-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1083.82},{"due_date":"2009-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1116.31},{"due_date":"2009-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1147.6}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1052.27},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1083.82},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1116.31},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1147.6}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":1052.27,"local_amount":1052.27,"processed_date":"2009-05-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T21:38:39Z","rounded_local_amount":1052.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44409845},{"amount":1083.82,"local_amount":1083.82,"processed_date":"2009-06-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T18:06:15Z","rounded_local_amount":1083.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52918292},{"amount":1116.31,"local_amount":1116.31,"processed_date":"2009-07-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T11:24:46Z","rounded_local_amount":1116.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63139131},{"amount":1147.6,"local_amount":1147.6,"processed_date":"2009-08-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T12:19:48Z","rounded_local_amount":1147.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73564751}],"funded_date":"2009-05-07T17:35:45Z","paid_date":"2009-09-15T12:19:48Z","journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Thelma Phillips","image":1504990}},{"id":106777,"name":"Goodnews","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Goodnews E. is twenty-seven years old and married with one child.

She lives in her own home, and her greatest dream is to live peacefully in her old age. Damiana's brick oven is located in the outskirts of the city of Juliaca, and she wakes up very early each morning to mix and mold the bricks, which she fires in the oven 10 days later. This activity has provided her with enough income to help her three children get ahead in life, and this is why she continues to make bricks. Her favorite part of the job is selling bricks and seeing that her work is well compensated.

Her desire to overcome enabled her to improve the living conditions for her family, which consists of her elderly mother and her 30 year old son who helps with the work around the house.\r\n<p>\r\nSelling clothes was one of the jobs she enjoyed as a young woman.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.
