The group leaders in this group represent a total of 72 individual farmers (not pictured), who are each asking for an average loan of 5,349 shillings to purchase a One Acre Fund package for \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of sorghum or millet.  As the Kiva group representative, Anthony is pictured on the right of the group with his hand raised.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nAnthony is a reliable member of the community.  He is married with 4 children.  Anthony is 30 years old and has been working as a farmer for the last 15 years to support his family.  In addition to this, Anthony is very active in his community and is involved in the men's group, and savings group, and prayer group, and burial committee.  He described his harvest last year as excellent.  He hopes to continue working with One Acre Fund and to continue the success he is having with the One Acre Fund farm packages.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nAnthony first enrolled with One Acre Fund in 2012 and is now preparing to be a One Acre Fund farmer during the 2014 Long Rains season.  Anthony joined One Acre Fund in order to get the best seed prices, and get new farming methods, and get fertilizer and hybrid seeds, and earn enough to feed family, and send children to school.  He also volunteered to be a group leader and Kiva representative because he is an active community member, and wants to help more farmers, and wants to spread the story about One Acre Fund farmers.  Anthony plans to use the money that he earns from his next harvest to repair the home, and send children to school, and save for the future, and buy a cow, and invest in a business.  He notes that working with One Acre Fund has lead to many benefits for One Acre Fund farmers.  Anthony\u2019s own life was improved because he has more profits from harvest, and has more farm training, and has more farm group support, and was able to save money, and was able to feed the family.  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nAnthony and his group need a loan to cover the initial costs of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer through One Acre Fund.  One Acre Fund will repay the Kiva loan on behalf of the farmers through the profits from the farmers\u2019 harvests.  One Acre Fund pre-purchases the seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings to the farmers.  Throughout the planting and harvesting season, One Acre Fund also provides training and support to the farmers as they make payments back to One Acre Fund.  With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits, and improved lives.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nThe field officer is also included in the photo and is standing on the left of the photo.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n"}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1496289,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To allow farmers the opportunity to buy cost efficient maize, millet, and sorghum seeds.\t\t\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Chwele","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":4450,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Anthony","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Florence","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rose","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tobista","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Irene","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Carolyne","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-26T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":385128,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":4450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":385128}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":4450}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lauren Coberly","image":null}},{"id":936560,"name":"Catalina","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Catalina, de 51 a\u00f1os de edad, es una se\u00f1ora muy trabajadora y emprendedora, tiene mucha experiencia en los negocios gastron\u00f3micos; actualmente vive con sus 2 hijos, uno de 23 a\u00f1os de edad que es empleado y una ni\u00f1a de 15 a\u00f1os de edad que estudia primaria.\n\nCatalina, tiene 16 a\u00f1os de experiencia en el \u00e1rea gastron\u00f3mica, ella vende todo tipo de tortas con diferentes ingredientes, es muy reconocida por la calidad de sus tortas y es por eso que la prefieren sus clientes.\n\nEl dinero del cr\u00e9dito lo necesita para comprar insumos alimenticios y para remodelar un poco m\u00e1s el local donde vende, todo para que su negocio sea m\u00e1s atractivo a la vista de los clientes. \n\nCatalina, desea en un futuro tener un negocio m\u00e1s grande y un local propio, porque la renta de los locales es muy cara.\n","en":"Catalina is 51 years old and a very hardworking and enterprising woman.

She sells at the Koutiala fish market, which is very popular with homemakers, restaurant owners on the square, and other passing clients. \r\n\r\n<p>Mrs. Aminata Dion\u00e9 estimates a monthly profit of 90,000 CFA francs, with which she will contribute to her household expenses, pay the interest on the loan, and add to her operating budget.

Then she puts them in boxes to take them to a market in the city. Her husband sows coffee, corn, yucca, beans, and bananas. When is the sowing season, she helps her husband.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Abdumannon is 36 years old. He is married with two children. Abdumannon is a market vendor. He sells fodder for the animals. The generated income is mainly used for the purchase of small bulls for raising and selling. Now Abdumannon is applying for a loan of 3000. He is planning to increase the working capital to expand the business and to use the generated income for forming a private farm for breeding the cattle. Abdumannon thanks all supporting him and promises to repay the loan promptly. \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Together with her husband, they live in the home of their parents.\r\n\r\nAbout six months ago she became independent, as she used to work with her parents on their farmlands.  Now, she works for herself on lands that her parents gave her to produce crops.  Since then, Ana and her husband have worked at clearing the fertile land and removed the weeds that affect the planting of coffee and bananas which are the items they want to grow.  This activity brings Ana a great deal of satisfaction, as she has knowledge she gained while working with her parents that gives her the ability to produce a good crop.  In addition, her parents have provided her with the necessary tools to get ahead.  She wants to be able to support her child, who she adores.  On the other hand, her husband works removing debris and sowing seeds for other people as well, and Ana brings him lunch and then helps him while the baby sleeps peacefully.  In this manner, the work is finished quicker which gives him the opportunity to start with his other work, which is beneficial for both of them.\r\n\r\nThis is her first loan with MFP and, given that they are motivated by the references they have with the institution, they are disposed to request the loan and meet the goals they have set for themselves.  They intent to use the funds to buy 400 banana plants to place on the land they have already prepared for crops. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Mary Lynn Malaby, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":425757,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To purchase banana plants.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Chanchamayo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.05 -75.316667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-11-17T13:00:11Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":225,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-10-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":600,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-14T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":600}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":225}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":225,"local_amount":600,"processed_date":"2010-08-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:39:17Z","rounded_local_amount":645.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166886548}],"funded_date":"2009-11-17T14:24:38Z","paid_date":"2010-09-15T10:39:17Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":156531,"name":"Lita","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Lita, pertenece al Banco Comunal \u201cLas Estrellitas II\u201d, Distrito de Tarapoto, Provincia de San Martin, Departamento de San Mart\u00edn,  Es Soltera, tiene 42 a\u00f1os y 01 hijo independiente.\n\nLita, lleva 10 a\u00f1os dedic\u00e1ndose a la confecci\u00f3n de vestidos, ya que teniendo conocimiento en este tipo de actividad, no dudo en implementar su propio taller de costura, ubicada en su misma casa, en un ambiente muy bien acondicionado, donde diariamente atiende a sus clientes fijos, que ya la conocen y necesitan el servicio.

The five children attend school normally. The second-hand clothing business is a family business, since her grandmother and her mother did this; she also chose this activity after their deaths. She began in 2004 with a capital of 55,000 francs, and now she would like to assert herself in this business. With the new loan she is going to get, she would like to buy top quality bundles of items, such as unworn clothes, end-of-series towels and unused bedsheets. Her maximum daily turnover is 60,000 francs, and when times are hard, her minimum turnover is 25,000 francs. She is very preoccupied with her children's future and wants to help them succeed by supporting them morally and financially. She has an ambition to open a shop which would be managed from one generation to another and would be left as an inheritance for her children. People close to her consider her to be a fighter and think that she will be really successful.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Alison Le Bras, Kiva

She has got a small business, which consists in the purchase and sale of fruits.  Its beginnings were difficult because she didn't have much capital.  It was then that she was presented with the opportunity to join the communal bank, Asociaci\u00f3n Arariwa, which offers loans and from there was able to improver her business.  She can be found at a stall in the central market, \"Virgen Asunta D. Ollantaytambo\", where she sells fruit brought from the Convenci\u00f3n valley and from the north of the country, seven days a week, from 8am until 4pm.  Aurelia is a responsible and hard working woman.  A regular flow of customers visit her stand, and her business gets quite busy in the mornings.  Aurelia hopes to receive $100 in her next loan.  At the moment, her stand is moderately stocked with fruit and she would like to use the money from her next loan to purchase more fruit, such as bananas, pineapples, oranges, etc.  Aurelia pertains to the communal bank, Amistad D.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Today, BRAC has emerged as an independent, virtually self-financed paradigm in sustainable human development. It is one of the largest Southern development organizations employing over 100,000 people, 61% of which are women, and working with the twin objectives of poverty alleviation and empowerment of the poor. Diagnosing poverty in human terms and recognizing its multifaceted nature, BRAC approaches poverty alleviation with a holistic approach.\r\n<br><br>The successes of BRAC in the international development arena have stimulated a series of discussions, both with African delegations, who have visited BRAC programs, and with donors who work in Asia and Africa. Both the African countries and the donors have encouraged BRAC to join the development campaign in Africa to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and more recently to join the campaign of \u201cending poverty\u201d, which is an area where Africa represents the greatest global challenge.\r\n<br><br> In Uganda, BRAC registered as a Non Government Organization (NGO) in January 2006 to undertake programs in Education, Health, Water & Sanitation, Agriculture & Livestock and Microfinance. The Microfinance and Education are the pioneer programs launched in Uganda and, as of July 2007, had served 21,273 borrowers and enrolled 1,155 adolescents in its education

She is mother of 3 children and together with her husband they acquired a home where they live and work at the same time.  In the past, her life as a young mother limited from her activities, but she soon found a way to break through those limits and set up her home inside of a restaurant, where the family has been working for the past 20 years. She didn't have to leave her children, but quite the opposite, they were of great support to her, together working to make their business one of the best in their district. In addition, what was most attracted customers to this restaurant was Yrmas delicious cooking, and thanks to the great demand they were able to improve and expand their business.  But with the passage of time it has been deteriorating and needs renovations.  She dreams of having a restaurant that is well known and prestigious, and to attain that dream she needs significant investments, given that renovations are so costly. She contacted MFP (Kiva Field Partner) and they are helping her to make her dreams a reality and she hopes that with the passing years she will be a permanent client.  Yrma has planned to invest 3000 soles in the roof renovations of her business.

Two of her children already got married.  She lives with her husband and three other children.  Their main jobs are farming and breeding animals.  The types of animals she breeds are also varied: chickens, ducks, pigs, geese, and buffaloes, depending on each season, the condition of the economy, and the local weather.  Since investing in the farm brings good profit, each year Ms. L. is able to borrow more money from TYM Fund.  On average, her income from breeding animals is about 2000 USD per year.  Her three children are working and helping her whenever she finds difficulty with the repayments.  This coming loan cycle, Ms. L. applies for a loan of 625USD to buy more ducks, chickens, and their food.\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Vietnamese by Phuong Nguyen, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nCh\u1ecb Cao Th\u1ecb Li\u00ean, 51 tu\u1ed5i, tham gia Qu\u1ef9 n\u0103m 1997. 2 ng\u01b0\u1eddi con \u0111\u00e3 c\u00f3 gia \u0111\u00ecnh ri\u00eang, ch\u1ecb Li\u00ean s\u1ed1ng c\u00f9ng ch\u1ed3ng v\u00e0 3 con.

This has been a very successful business.  When Andrei originally intended to start his business he was skeptical because he did not have enough money to launch the business. He had just closed a lucrative soap shop temporarily to move to a new location. After finally signing the lease, not even two weeks before he was to open, the owners of the property told him that he could not sell jewelry there because his shop would be competing with a major new store that was opening soon. Andrei had two choices. He could either back out of the lease or continue with the lease with a different product mix. This was a very viable location and he did not want to let it go. Over the coming days Andrei had to come up with an idea that he could feel comfortable with in order to move forward. He already had the oils because he carried them in his soap shop, so he decided to renegotiate the lease for a small fragrance shop instead. He knows that this would turn out to be one of the best decisions of his life. Andrei borrowed from the Kiva partner, Microinvest, to pay for the original rental of the shop. Andrei is sure that he will succeed in his business and will return the loan in time to Microinvest.

The loan will be used to buy more quantities of coffee that Sylivia can sell to customers in her community. Sylivia hopes to expand her business and possibly sell other products, and gain a greater income for her family.    \r\n\r\n<b>Note to lenders: <\/b>BRAC Uganda has recently begun posting a new loan product to Kiva which funds young entrepreneurs in BRAC\u2019s Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. This Kiva borrower is receiving a new ELA loan. The ELA program first provides disadvantaged adolescents, usually girls who are out of school, with livelihood training and financial literacy skills. Afterward, ELA participants can receive microfinance loans to expand their small businesses. These loans offer adolescents a unique chance to access finance at a young age and improve their prospects for the future, and target a segment of the population not typically served by traditional microfinance. Kiva is privileged to partner with BRAC Uganda in posting these new loans, and to give Kiva lenders the opportunity to fund deserving young entrepreneurs and support a promising new sector in microfinance.

She is married to Fidmer, age 33, and they live in their own home with only one of their three children.  From a young age Rosario worked on a farm.  Her parents were experienced farmers who taught her all the farming techniques that she now employs.  Since then, fifteen years have passed.  She now works independently growing potatoes and her husband helps with monitoring their crops.  Rosario loves the land where she was born and has always planted large tracts of potatoes because the area where she lives is in high altitude, making it an ideal place for producing the best tubers.  What she enjoys most is aligning the rows of potatoes, a technique that has helped her develop freely as a farmer and has resulted in successful crops.  However, she has to carry heavy sacks of potatoes and transport them directly to the market where the buyers are located.  She does all this in order to have more income.  Rosario hopes to open a vending post at the city market where she can sell vegetables and potatoes.\r\n<p>\r\nThis is the first time she has taken a loan with MFP.  Rosario is happy to be working with this Communal Bank because she knows all of the members.  The loan she requested will be used to buy several sacks of compost for her potato crop.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":568153,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Purchase compost","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-07-18T05:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosario ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-06-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":375}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":375,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:32:37Z","rounded_local_amount":1059,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206195451}],"funded_date":"2010-07-18T09:47:39Z","paid_date":"2011-05-15T11:32:37Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ronan Reodica","image":498323}},{"id":218685,"name":"Eunice","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Born in 1966, Eunice D. is the mother of three children.

This is the first time she has requested a loan from GHAPE. As she was unable to get investment capital that would help increase her income, she was motivated to request a loan from GHAPE. \r\n\r\nWith the loan, she plans to buy three tins of beans seedlings for 195,500FCFA and she will use 30,500FCFA to pay for labor on her farm. She will pay for clearing, hoeing and planting.\r\n\r\nShe thinks the business will succeed because she has been doing this activity for a very long time, she has a plot of land on which to operate and, also, her community will provide a ready market for her beans when they are ready.

He is very satisfied with the loan that this institution has offered him."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":649407,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Electronics Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To invest in his business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Piedras Negras","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"28.7 -100.516667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":18,"posted_date":"2010-11-24T10:50:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":450,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jesus Joaquin","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-11-23T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":5248,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":437.33},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":437.33},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":437.33},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":437.33},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":437.33},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":437.33},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":437.33},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":437.33},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":437.33},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":437.33},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":437.33},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":437.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":45,"local_amount":524.75,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T02:49:24Z","rounded_local_amount":553.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191407840},{"amount":45,"local_amount":524.75,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T08:30:12Z","rounded_local_amount":553.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195826112},{"amount":45,"local_amount":524.75,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T10:45:35Z","rounded_local_amount":553.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201268346},{"amount":45,"local_amount":524.75,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T10:44:09Z","rounded_local_amount":553.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206135175},{"amount":45,"local_amount":524.75,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T10:57:49Z","rounded_local_amount":553.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211207564},{"amount":45,"local_amount":524.75,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T10:51:29Z","rounded_local_amount":553.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216485881},{"amount":45,"local_amount":524.75,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:38:56Z","rounded_local_amount":553.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221648912},{"amount":45,"local_amount":524.75,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T08:49:05Z","rounded_local_amount":553.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227016748},{"amount":45,"local_amount":524.75,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T08:41:26Z","rounded_local_amount":553.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232776076},{"amount":45,"local_amount":525.25,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T09:45:08Z","rounded_local_amount":554.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238580495}],"funded_date":"2010-11-24T22:50:19Z","paid_date":"2011-11-15T09:45:08Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Oxnard","image":null}},{"id":255569,"name":"Wilma","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Wilma G. is a 50 year old married woman who supports her family by operating a fishing business.

She has been living in Setovi, alone with one of her children, for five years. Philomene did not attend school.\r\n\r\nIn order to provide for her own needs and to guarantee that her child gets an education, Philomene has been active for about eight years in the retail of various products including rice, beans, canned food, soap and local beverages (the group's other members sell firewood). Philomene purchases her products in Dantokpa, Benin's international market, and sells them in her neighborhood of Setovi.

is the world\u2019s second largest producer of cocoa. While most of the crop is exported to make chocolate, Abena, 45, uses cocoa pod, baking soda, and palm oil to make soap locally. She sells two main types of soap, Alata and Azuma blow. Alata is a Twi word for Nigerian, because the soap originated from Nigeria. Azuma is a famous boxer. Supposedly this soap can combat any laundry stain like Azuma combats his opponents. \r\n<p>\r\nAbena has 23 years of experience making soap. Her soap is so popular, that every time she makes it, it sells out in about a week. She is requesting a loan so she can purchase more raw materials to make more soap, since people in the market are demanding it. \r\n<p>\r\nOther than expanding her store, Abena is using her profits to complete her home. Currently she lives in a half-built house with her husband and seven children. Most of the rooms are incomplete and uninhabitable. \r\n<p>\r\nAbena is a leader of the lending group, The Believers.

Huancavelica is considered one of the poorest regions of Peru and has many limitations being a very mountainous area (altituD. ranges from 2,000 \u2013 5,000 meters above sea level), the cold, the difficulty of growing crops and the lack of adequate infrastructure of roads and communication systems.\r\n<p>\r\nBCR \u201cAmanccay\u201d, is located at approximately 3,500 meters above sea-level, in the community of A\u00f1ancusi in the district of Acoria, province of Huancavelica. The name \"Amanccay\" comes from a local flower. The main activities of the population are the growth of corn, potatoes and wheat (higher altitudes), and at lower altitudes of the Mantaro River tropical fruits. Most of the population also have cows, bulls and sheep, and at the higher altitudes llamas and alpacas. In the small town the population have some shops and proviD. several services, but the main commercial activity is on Tuesday, when there is the local market, where most people do business. \r\n<p>\r\nCurrently the bank is starting its first loan-cycle with currently 12 female borrowers and a total loan of 4,200 soles (about 1,550 US$). The loans range from 200, 400, and up to 500 soles. As the group is just starting its first cycle, the group was not able to save, except for the initial loan to start. But all agree to save in the future.\r\n<p>\r\nOne of the members of the community bank is Isabel Ignacia D. L. C. T.. Isabel has a small \u201ccafetin\u201d business where she sells  sweets, sandwiches and soft drinks at the local school. Besides her \u201ccafetin\u201d she sells fruits at local markets. With her 200 soles loan, she will buy more things for her business.  Sometimes she kills one of the sheep to sell the meat. Like most people she has a small plot of land where the family cultivates a variety of products and has a small stock of cattle. With FINCA Per\u00fa she hopes to have her own savings to be able to buy a house in a bigger town, to work more enthusiastically and with more responsibility and to receive trainings. And her dream\u2026.. for her son to be a professional!\r\n<p>\r\nAnother story tells Epifania M. Y., who has her own grocery store. With her 500 soles loan she will buy more groceries to fill up her store again. And like Isabel, she also has a small plot where the family cultivates a variety of products and has a small stock of cattle, but mostly for their own consumption. Her dream for the future is to buy a house in Huancayo, one of the major cities in the central Andes, and for her children to be professionals. With her savings she will able to increase business, buying more merchandise and selling more. Now that she will be working with FINCA Peru, she hopes to save more, to receive trainings and to be respected as a woman."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1575,"image":{"id":152765,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Buy new supplies for business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":70,"posted_date":"2008-04-28T00:10:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1575,"lender_count":38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ana Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Guillermina Elda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Celestina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Teresa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alejandra","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Julia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Epifania","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Emilia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Julia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Feliciana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lidia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Isabel Ignacia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-05-14T02:25:48Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":4200,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":1575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":700},{"due_date":"2008-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":700},{"due_date":"2008-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":700},{"due_date":"2008-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":700},{"due_date":"2008-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":700},{"due_date":"2008-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":700}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":262.5},{"due_date":"2008-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":262.5},{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":262.5},{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":262.5},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":262.5},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":262.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":263,"local_amount":701.33,"processed_date":"2008-06-14T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T03:54:29Z","rounded_local_amount":711.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238061},{"amount":263,"local_amount":701.33,"processed_date":"2008-07-14T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T04:01:38Z","rounded_local_amount":711.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":266935},{"amount":263,"local_amount":701.33,"processed_date":"2008-08-14T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T04:04:39Z","rounded_local_amount":711.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":296038},{"amount":263,"local_amount":701.33,"processed_date":"2008-09-14T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-09-23T07:12:40Z","rounded_local_amount":711.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":326599},{"amount":263,"local_amount":701.33,"processed_date":"2008-10-14T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-16T07:09:45Z","rounded_local_amount":711.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":359842},{"amount":260.01,"local_amount":693.35,"processed_date":"2008-11-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-16T03:46:31Z","rounded_local_amount":703.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5314309}],"funded_date":"2008-04-30T02:25:48Z","paid_date":"2009-01-21T03:10:43Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":49866,"name":"Adjoagan Lucienne","description":{"languages":["fr"],"texts":{"fr":"Born in 1951 in Lom\u00e9, Mrs. Adjoagan Lucienne A. is separated from her husband who began taking additional wives twenty years ago.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets; thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.

On weekends she also works at a discotheque near her home as a waitress.  She tells us that the commissions and incentives she gets from the beauty products sales she has bought items for her living room, bedroom, kitchen and dining room.  She also gets items that are on sale of both brands like shampoo, cologne, perfume, etc. and then resells them at a higher price.  This is how she is able to cover household expenses and provide her two children with what they need.\r\n\r\nBesides, Maria tells us that every week she participates in a junta (a collection of money among several persons) that is raffled off on the weekend. She uses that income to buy groceries, school supplies and food for her children.\r\n\r\nThe recent loan that she was granted she will use to buy more stock beauty supplies to increase sales and thus profits.\r\n\r\nShe is happy to be able to participate in this system that supports micro businesspeople like her.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":950,"image":{"id":599951,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To buy beauty products.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Huarochiri","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.916667 -76.416667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":93,"posted_date":"2010-09-16T16:45:15Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":950,"lender_count":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Teresa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Loyda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Magali","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marisa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Eugenia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Olinda Gloria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Aurora Patricia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-09-09T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2600,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":950,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":650},{"due_date":"2010-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":650},{"due_date":"2010-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":650},{"due_date":"2011-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":650}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":237.5},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":237.5},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":237.5},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":237.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":237.5,"local_amount":650,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T13:36:25Z","rounded_local_amount":662.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177390887},{"amount":237.5,"local_amount":650,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T13:43:45Z","rounded_local_amount":662.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182529167},{"amount":237.5,"local_amount":650,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T12:52:39Z","rounded_local_amount":662.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188665275},{"amount":237.5,"local_amount":650,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T02:51:59Z","rounded_local_amount":662.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191408524}],"funded_date":"2010-09-17T20:51:42Z","paid_date":"2011-02-16T02:51:59Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":235089,"name":"Teresita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Teresita D.

They all now do different kinds of work to contribute to the family financially.\r\n<p>\r\nParveen supports her family financially by sewing  and selling clothes. She mainly gets sewing orders from her neighborhood clients and sells a variety of her clothes to different clothing shops. She also imports clothes from Faisalabad (famous for its textile industry in Pakistan) at cheap rates, and by selling them to different clothing shops she earns a good profit.\r\n<p>\r\nParveen has applied for a loan from Kiva\u2019s partner Asasah for her clothing business. She will invest the loan in purchasing clothes of different varieties in bulk quantities. The bulk purchasing will cut  her cost of travelling and also minimize the purchase price. She is experienced in her business and is confident that after investment, her business will improve and she will easily pay back her loan installments.\r\n<p>\r\nParveen is a regular Asasah borrower. This is her fourth loan application. In previous loan periods, she  proved herself a responsible client who never missed any meetings and paid her installments on time.\r\n<p>\r\nIn the photo, the woman who holds a book (called an \u201cAsasah Passbook\u201d) in her hands is Parveen.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":628357,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing

Adem\u00e1s les ofrece trabajo a 4 personas que se encargan de atender a los clientes, como garzonas y las dos personas restantes son maestras de cocina. \nSu anhelo es que se reconstruya Dichato, junto con esto obtener su vivienda propia, ya que a causa del tsunami que asol\u00f3 esa zona el 27 de febrero del a\u00f1o 2010, Leonor qued\u00f3 sin nada, por lo que tuvo que volver a reconstruir su vida y negocio.

Leonor has been making and selling empanadas and pastries for 12 years. Her shop is located in the commercial center of Dichato. However, due to the aftershocks of the tsunami in Japan, high waves devastated the coast of Dichato again, which has lowered the number of visitors and restaurant customers which sought her products wholesale. Despite this situation the weekends attract a lot people.\r\nLeonor lives with her \u200b\u200b4 children, 18, 16, 12 and 8 years of age, who help her in her business either at the cash register or in the kitchen to cook certain products. She also employs four people to serve the customers as waiters and the two remaining people are chefs.\r\nHer dreams are that Dichato will be rebuilt and to obtain her own home because she was left with nothing after the tsunami that struck the area on February 27, 2010 and had to rebuild her life and her business. Currently, she is living with her children in a shack the city of Dichato provided for her. Regarding her business, Leonor intends to have her business independently, to obtain higher profits and build a microenterprise with her children. Her motivations are to provide her children with a better life and to fund their studies.\r\nWith this loan she intends to buy an electric fryer and supplies to make empanadas such as flour, eggs, oil, lard and seafood. \r\nLeonor is very grateful for the loan granted by field partner Fondo Esperanza because of the ease in making payments.

Despite efforts by their loan officer and community members, the child could not be saved.\r\n<p>\r\nWith their first loan, Yecenia and her husband bought tools, two sacks of sugar, and other ingredients necessary to make sugar cane sticks. Using the knowledge gained from his previous employment, Manuel maD. the candy while Yecenia sold it around the neighborhood. With each of their three following payments, Yecenia and Manuel have been able to expand their business to incluD. four more types of candy and a vendor who takes the highway to the center of Santo Domingo to sell.\r\n<p\r\nWith the money they have earned, Yecenia and Manuel have been able to move into a two-bedroom shack that they rent, which is not only bigger, but in a less dangerous location, and they are able to proviD. food for their children. They are saving money right now through the programmed and voluntary loans offered at Esperanza so that they can buy their own house in the future. They have been exemplary in repaying their loans. They have not missed a single repayment date despite various hardships. For example, one particular day, Manuel suffered a heat stroke while making candy. Instead of using the money he was saving to repay the loan to pay for going to the hospital, Manuel repaid the loan and refused to go to the hospital. Friends and community members forced him to go to the hospital and chipped in to help him pay for the bill. Another time they were robbed of their money only days before the loan repayment date, but they somehow managed to make enough money to make their payment.

Sus planes a futuro son de seguir sembrando, adem\u00e1s su madre le propuso traspasarle su tienda, a lo que ha aceptado, y empezar\u00e1 a trabajar en ella para que poco a poco pueda pagarle a su madre el valor de su bodega. Este es su 8vo pr\u00e9stamo consecutivo con MFP, y en todo este tiempo ha trabajado con responsabilidad, y en su cargo de tesorera cumple cabalmente sus funciones, as\u00ed como con cada una de sus cuotas se\u00f1aladas. El dinero que ahora solicita es para la compra de fertilizantes, asimismo para pagar parte del traspaso de la tienda de su madre.","en":"<p>Maximiliana is 20 years old and lives with her partner, the father of her 2 children and they live in her parents' house. This year they have sowed peas, potatoes and yams in her parents' plantation fields. Her husband is responsible for the plowing and preparation of the fields. This type of work is carried out the fields only after they have been rested from cultivation for 2 or 3 years. This down time allows the fields to be very fertile and do not require many additional fertilizers. Maximiliana loves to be a farmer, something she has been doing since she was a little girl and now with the help of her husband her work is much lighter. Her plans for the future are to keep sowing and her mother also proposed giving her the store and she has accepted. She will start working in the store and with time she will be able to pay her mother the value of the grocery store. This is her eighth consecutive loan with MFP (Kiva Field Partner) and all this time she has been participating responsibly. In her role as the treasurer she has been carrying out her duties and she has been making her payments on time. The funds that she is requesting now will be used to purchase fertilizers and some of the money will be used to pay for the handover of the store from her mother.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Erika Lindig, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":100,"image":{"id":306920,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To purchase fertilizers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-04-22T18:00:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":100,"lender_count":4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maximiliana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-03-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":300,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":300}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":100,"local_amount":300,"processed_date":"2009-06-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:43:48Z","rounded_local_amount":308.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52990360}],"funded_date":"2009-04-22T20:32:03Z","paid_date":"2009-07-15T22:43:48Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":107245,"name":"Martha","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Martha is 35-year-old businesswoman.

She is married and has two children.  One of her children is currently in school.  Viola has a business of selling clothes, which she has had for less than one year.         \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Viola has requested a loan of 200,000 Ugandan Shillings from Kiva partner BRAC Uganda.  The loan will be used to purchase more clothes.  With the help of the loan from BRAC, Viola hopes to generate greater profits and to buy food and clothes for her children.  In the future, Viola hopes to enlarge her business\r\n\r\nNote to lenders:   BRAC Uganda has recently begun posting a new loan product to Kiva which funds young entrepreneurs in BRAC\u2019s Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program.  This Kiva borrower is receiving a new ELA loan. Initially, the ELA program provides disadvantaged adolescents, particularly girls who are out of school, with livelihood training and financial literacy skills.  Afterwards, ELA participants can receive microfinance loans to expand their small businesses.  These loans offer adolescents a unique chance to access finance at a young age and improve their prospects for the future.

She is married to Severino, age 44, and they have nine children.  They have their own home located along Tupac Amaru Avenue in the District of Kimbiri.  Astria and her husband are the breadwinners of their family.  When Astria was a young girl, her parents taught her how to work on a farm.  She is now a farmer and has five hectares of land on which she plants coffee and pineapples, tropical fruits grown in the Apurimac River Valley.  Astria has worked on her land for 22 years, and during the harvest season she has the help of her children and the labor of workers who can pick the fruit with great speed.  She considers the most difficult part of her job to be transporting her products from the farm to the distribution centers in the city of San Francisco, the place that offers the best prices for grain and pineapples.  Her difficulty is when she lacks sufficient income to pay her workers in advance since they provide assistance during the harvest.  For this reason, she has taken out loans with institutions such as MFP.  Now her highest priority is to plant more pineapples since she has two hectares of land that have not been cultivated.  \n\nThis is her seventh loan with MFP.  Astria feels the support has helped her greatly in making progress in her work.  In her Communal Bank, she is well-respected by the other members.  The loan of 2000 PEN that she is requesting will be used to hire workers to help with the harvest.  \n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":728259,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To hire workers to help with the harvest.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"CUSCO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.518333 -71.978056","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-03-14T22:30:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":725,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Astria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-03-07T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":725}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":725,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:51:24Z","rounded_local_amount":2007.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250835251}],"funded_date":"2011-03-15T11:04:10Z","paid_date":"2012-01-15T10:51:24Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ronan Reodica","image":498323}},{"id":284284,"name":"Yovanna","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Yovana de 26 a\u00f1os, natural de la comunidad la Libertad anexo del distrito de Quimbiri; esta casada con Alfredo de 30 a\u00f1os de edad y tienen 02 hijas Rosal\u00eda de 09 y  Gressy de 07 meses de nacida y juntos viven en su propio lote a medio construir situado en el distrito de Quimbiri.
