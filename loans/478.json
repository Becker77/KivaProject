Because customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets, the women lack tangible collateral assets, and financial institutions do not consider them to be credit-worthy. This leads to poor financial support and, as a result, limited access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.<\/P>\r\n\r\n<P>SELFINA buys and leases equipment to women.

Reyna group consists of two members: Reyna Isabel S. and Luis Alberto M..  Luis is 78, and his friend Reyna is 44.  Reyna is single and has 3 children: her oldest, 22, works for himself; her daughter, 20, is in her 5th year of high school;   and her son, 18, is in the 5th grade of elementary school and works nights.  Luis is married and has 5 children: his oldest, 40, is in his 2nd year of high school, and works for himself; his son, 38, is in his 3rd year of high school; another son, 32, is in his 5th year of high school; his daughter, 26, is in her 3rd year of high school; and his youngest son, 26, is in his 4th year of high school.  All of Luis's children both work and study; they didn't have the opportunity to go to school before and now they want to.  His wife is a homemaker.  \r\n\r\nLuis's plans include improving his house for his family.  He would like to buy a pickup truck so he can better serve his customers and sell more firewood.  He would also like to upgrade his construction equipment.  Rosa's goal is to keep her business active so she can continue to generate more income for her family.  She would like to expand her business by hiring three women to help her out.  She also wants to offer more products to her customers.  Rosa wants to run a business that is more useful to her community so she can meet her customers' needs.  \r\n\r\nLuis and Reyna are in different lines of work.  Luis makes his living selling firewood, while Reyna makes and sells tortillas.  She works from her home and has been in business for 14 years.  Luis travels around, and has been in business for 15 years.  He had started out in a different business: he had 8 pigs, which he later sold, and used the money to buy a horse and wagon.  Later, one of his sons gave him the money to start his firewood business, and he paid his son back with his earnings.  He liked this business since it gave him income for his family and his customers bought plenty from him.  Reyna, on the other hand, started with her own money, which she earned working as a domestic.  She liked her tortilla business and she decided to stay with it.  She invested her earnings into her business, enabling her to start doing business from her home. \r\n\r\nReyna is seeking a loan to use as working capital, as she has to buy firewood, corn, and lime, and the price of corn is very high.  Luis is seeking a loan for working capital.  He plans to use the money to buy a power saw, to make his work easier.  He also needs to make improvements to his wagon and buy medicine for his horse.  The horse and wagon are necessary for his business, and he has to give his horse medicine.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jill Heske, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":263094,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"working capital","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Leon","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.435556 -86.879444","type":"point"}},"partner_id":96,"posted_date":"2009-01-29T18:40:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":225,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Reyna Isabel ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Luis Alberto ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-08T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":4000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2009-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2009-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2009-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2009-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":800}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":45,"local_amount":800,"processed_date":"2009-02-09T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T08:40:16Z","rounded_local_amount":896.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20400025},{"amount":75.29,"local_amount":1338.48,"processed_date":"2009-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T18:37:24Z","rounded_local_amount":1499.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27092023},{"amount":14.71,"local_amount":261.52,"processed_date":"2009-04-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T16:37:25Z","rounded_local_amount":292.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35985406},{"amount":45,"local_amount":800,"processed_date":"2009-05-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T23:08:54Z","rounded_local_amount":896.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44446021},{"amount":45,"local_amount":800,"processed_date":"2009-06-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T20:39:04Z","rounded_local_amount":896.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52956660}],"funded_date":"2009-01-30T04:37:47Z","paid_date":"2009-07-15T20:39:04Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jill Heske","image":253856}},{"id":90489,"name":"Istemeli","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Istemeli A. is a 35-year-old farmer who breeds calves in the small village of Imishli City.

Ayungon, La Carlota City, Negros Occidental. She is 52 and has two adult children, ages 26 and 28. Her older son graduated from college with a degree in Mass Communication and already has his own family. Her younger son is a trained radio technician. He has not yet found work in his field of study, so he currently earns his living by driving one of two tricycles (a motorcycle with a sidecar for passengers) owned by Suzette.\r\n<p>\r\nDespite being separated from her husband, Suzette strives hard to meet her familial obligations, trying to be both mother and father to her sons. Without the additional support of another breadwinner in the family, Suzette has been doing her utmost to continue pursuing her dreams for her children, because she truly believes that her dream will come true. She holds on and trusts that she can succeed through hard work, perseverance, and full faith in the Almighty.\r\n<p>\r\nHer progress out of poverty started in 2003 when she joined NWTF-Project Dungganon and borrowed PHP 3,000 to start a food vending business. She started out as a sort of one-man band: she both cooked the food and sold it to people in her neighborhood. She began buying bananas in bulk and selling them to her neighbors in retail. Her business activities also helped her adjust to her new single status, and she became more independent and empowered because she knew she had the capacity to provide for her young family.\r\n<p>\r\nAs her business continued to improve, she was able to buy a motorized water pump for her house, which in turn allowed her to raise pigs in her backyard without offending her neighbors with the usual foul odor that occurs when a pig-raising business is not maintained well. From her subsequent loans, she was able to buy tricycles for her sons to drive, allowing them to help earn a living for their families. She was also able to buy the rights to a piece of land. Her combined net income from all her business activities eventually amounted to PHP 3,500 per month.\r\n<p>\r\nBecause of her good credit performance in her group, her center, and NWTF-PD (Negro Women for Tomorrow Foundation - Project Dungannon), she was able to secure the amount of Php 19,500 for her thirteenth cycle loan, which she used for her business. The loan was paid in timely weekly installments and was fully paid within its set term. \r\n<p>\r\nFor her fourteenth cycle, she is borrowing Php 25,000 to be used for her business, as well as to pay for motorcycle maintenance, because when the machines are in good condition they are able to generate more income. The profits earned from this loan will be used for the needs of her family. \r\n<p>\r\nSuzette is shown in the picture posing with the two tricycles that are in need of maintenance work.\r\n<p>\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\n<p>\r\nIn a world full of challenges, the Negro Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the calling of not just of a few but thousands of women. Through the alleviation program, these women have progressed from earning less than a measly $1 a day to surpassing realities beyond their dreams. They have learned to live a life where they can finally be called honorable. This is Project Dungganon.

She owns a business venture, providing general  alteration & tailoring services to local community members.  Tauinaola has many years of experience in this business.  Tauinaola needs a loan of WST $1750 to purchase additional fabrics & materials.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 220 tala or US $92 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Tauinaola joined SPBD.  This is her 3rd loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Tauinaola's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Tauinaola G. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                2 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              2 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.99 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              1 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/www.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

He has gained a lot of experience in this business as he has always helped out a lot with the cultivation of crops in his home community of Isfara, Tajikistan. Now he is the father of three adult children. Nowadays Janobiddin has managed to improve his family\u2019s economic situation thanks to the help brought to him by IMON International through a loan that he has used directly for his agricultural business. On this occasion Janobiddin is seeking IMON International\u2019s help so that he can benefit from improved technical assistance in his farming - so that, when harvest time comes around, he can improve his economic situation. Please support this father so his effort is worthwhile. \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

Mary herself never went to school due to poverty. Besides her own children, Mary also cares for a niece and nephew.\r\n\r\nMary's business is the sale of general goods, such as soap and candles, and food items, such as seasonings and pepper, onions, and rice.  She has been in business for more than 30 years, and today she sells from a market stall at the Chicken Soup Factory Market in Gardnersville, near Liberia's capital of Monrovia. During the Liberian civil war, Mary and her family fled the country for neighboring Guinea. When she returned to Liberia, she started her general goods business with about 30,000 Liberian dollars in seed money. With her 20,000 Liberian dollar share of this 75,000 Liberian dollar group loan, Mary plans to buy more inventory for her shop.\r\n\r\nIn the future, Mary hopes to grow her business and open a store that sells general goods.

The organization is devoted to the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through microfinance as a practical way to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets; thus, they are deemed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and hence poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.

She lives in her own house with her 3 children; Edwin 26 years old, Jes\u00fas 23 years old and Cinthia, 7 years of age, who are the reason for all of her efforts. Her business is the sale of shopping bags, which she sells in the street as a traveling salesperson in search of customers who wish to take one of her attractive bags.  Her colorful products are in high demand in the market as people always have things that they need to take home.  What she likes most about her work is to speak with her customers and find out about the things happening in her area.   She has been doing this activity for 20 years and the most difficult thing for her it to have to walk all day under the intense sun, which tires and exhausts her, although she knows she is working hard to be able to achieve her goals.  In the future she hopes to have a small stand where she can sell her shopping bags without having to walk so much.  This is Nelida\u2019s first loan with MFP and she knows that she has to make all of her payments on time if she does not want to cause problems for the members of her communal bank where she is very admired for the responsibility that she demonstrates. With the 1000 soles requested she plans to buy more shopping bags to increase the quantity that she sells.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Aimee Sostowski, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":315652,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To Increase Merchandise","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Puno","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15.833333 -70.033333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-05-07T21:10:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nelida","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-04-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":165}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-05-08T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T00:54:58Z","rounded_local_amount":175.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44596212},{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-06-08T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:38:56Z","rounded_local_amount":175.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52990490},{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-07-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:40:15Z","rounded_local_amount":175.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63211601},{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-08-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:19:05Z","rounded_local_amount":175.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73641122},{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-09-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:32:01Z","rounded_local_amount":175.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87080562},{"amount":57.75,"local_amount":165,"processed_date":"2009-10-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:00:51Z","rounded_local_amount":172.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96996687}],"funded_date":"2009-05-08T00:46:49Z","paid_date":"2009-11-16T03:00:51Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Aimee Sostowski","image":null}},{"id":110985,"name":"Asia Aslam Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sadia Batool baji wants a loan to buy mobile phones for her mobile phone shop.<P>\r\n\r\nRani baji and Rukhsana baji each want a loan to buy raw materials (lentils, cooking oil and spices) for their food businesses.<P>\r\n\r\nAsia baji is married to Mr. A. who runs a stationery-selling business.

Jamolidin is 36 years old, married, and has two children. He grows vegetables and sells them in the market for income. He has been working in this kind of business sphere for almost 13 years and gained much experiences. Jamolidin has a large family considering that he is leaving with his parents. With his large family, Jamolidin works almost everyday to generate revenues for to support his family's living. Because of his family relying on vegetable growing, Jamolidin needs a loan to purchase necessary supplies for his current harvest and with that way to earn enough money for supporting his family. This will be his first loan with IMON International and Kiva and his evaluation shows he is qualified to receive the loan.\n\n\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\n\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Bird","image":220084}},{"id":172758,"name":"Avazmat","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"A. Avazmat was born in 1964 and is married with two children. As an aspiring and hard-working man he has always dreamed of achieving success in whatever he does. Thus, when he joined IMON International, he was able to make a lot of progress with his previous loan, which he invested mostly in crop farming. Then, he saw a new business opportunity: rearing young cattle, which is very profitable because of the constant demand for meat at the market. Given this loan, Avazmat will purchase young cattle and feed for them to expand his business. He plans to use the profits from his business to educate his children, improve the structure of his home, and improve the standard of living of his family.    \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International:\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New Western culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

She is 31 years old. Arlene is married and has 2 school-aged children. To make a living, Arlene owns and operates a sari-sari (variety) retail shop. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from buying and selling daily use products such as shampoo, soap, toothpaste, canned goods, junk foods, and detergents in the local community. She is also engaging in buying and selling ready to wear clothing. Arlene has been engaged in her business for over 2 years and earns approximately 6,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Arlene joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Arlene has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to buy and sell. Arlene is requesting a new loan of 12,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional inventory and working capital. This loan will be the 4th loan taken out by Arlene from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

con el liderazgo de su madre, muchos de ellos son parte de la basta clientela,  que tiene Xiomara en su negocio de confeccionar prendas de vestir como camisas, pantalones y ropa femenina en

She lives with her family in the Las Am\u00e9ricas neighborhood, a community that is undergoing community organization; under her mother\u2019s leadership the neighbors that live there have united and managed to equip parks.  Many of them are part of the vast clientele that Xiomara has in her dressmaking business.  She makes shirts, pants and women\u2019s clothes in general.\r\n\r\nEver since she was a little girl, Xiomara would play with her friends and she was the dolls\u2019 dressmaker.  Since then she showed her inclination towards this art.  Today, she has 20 years experience in the occupation and 17 running her business located in a site she owns.  \r\n\r\nXiomara is very proud of her development adding that it\u2019s the activity which she most enjoys and with which she\u2019s managed her home especially with respect to her children\u2019s schooling.  \r\n\r\nIn her operation she has a simple sewing machine, an overlock machine and an interlock machine as well as additional tools to produce quality items although her dream is to have in her business\u2019 infrastructure the most technologically advanced machines to offer employment to people who need it.\r\n\r\nHer Kiva loan is the first financing with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  She will use it to buy three bolts of fabric and supplies to make women\u2019s dresses she has on order and has to have ready on time for her customers.  This investment will be successful because she will deliver completed orders to new and recommended customers which will lead to an increase in her accounts receivable portfolio which, in turn, impacts her profits.\r\n\r\nHer goal for later on is to modify her home so she strives daily with this in mind and works persistently in order to reach it.  While this happens, though, Xiomara continues generating a profit margin of no less than 40% that she plans to sustain so that her business continues growing.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":773759,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to

Little by little she saved enough money to buy her house, where she set up a restaurant serving breakfast, lunch and dinner to her customers.    Her main customers are the people who live in her area, as well as others who come from farther away.    To get to where she is today, Guillermina had to go through some difficult times, including a collapse of part of her house.  Although she lost a lot, she still kept going, rebuilding with a great deal of effort and work. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p> She is part of the communal bank called Usquil, which granted her first loan to help her build her business after the damage to her house.

She is married with eight children. At the moment, two are still in the senior high school. Martha has been a local manufacturer of palm oil and palm kernel for seven years now. Palm oil is produced from palm nut fruits and the palm kernel is a by-product of palm oil, which is produced first. The palm kernel is processed through various stages to obtain the palm kernel oil, which is used to prepare many local dishes.<\/p> \r\n\r\n<p>Martha's production is on a small scale due to inadequate capital to buy machines for the processing. She wants to use the loan to buy more palm nuts to increase her efficiency to produce in larger quantities.

For 2 years she has managed her own business. She owns a car and hires a driver to provide transportation services to passengers and which every day yields profits. She tells us that earlier she had a grocery store, but because one of her sons was thinking about joining the navy, she sold the store to pay for all of his preparations. Afterwards, he, with his earnings, helped his mother to buy the car.  Solinda feels happy with her job, that is already profitable and can also provide work to another person and offers his small children a better future.  In the future, she wants to acquire another car for one of her sons to drive, who are also eager to work. This is her fourth loan with MFP. Earlier she worked with communal banks, but it turns out that she is more comfortable to take out an individual loan because she does not have much free time. The money she is asking for will be invested in mechanical repairs for the car as well as a new coat of paint and will also be used for gas. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Machelle Wilson, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":375138,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Taxi","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"auto maintenance","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-08-22T18:50:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"lender_count":3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Solinda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-08-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":150.11},{"due_date":"2009-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":157.46},{"due_date":"2009-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":162.83},{"due_date":"2009-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":170.28},{"due_date":"2010-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":176.6},{"due_date":"2010-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":182.72}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.54},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.11},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.99},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.6},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":61.81},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.95}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":52.54,"local_amount":150.11,"processed_date":"2009-09-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:38:14Z","rounded_local_amount":154.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87081220},{"amount":55.11,"local_amount":157.46,"processed_date":"2009-10-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:09:59Z","rounded_local_amount":162.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96997371},{"amount":56.99,"local_amount":162.83,"processed_date":"2009-11-19T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:55:27Z","rounded_local_amount":168.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103842715},{"amount":185.36,"local_amount":529.6,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-26T10:01:28Z","rounded_local_amount":546.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734297}],"funded_date":"2009-08-22T18:59:19Z","paid_date":"2010-01-26T10:01:28Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Machelle Wilson","image":261196}},{"id":135620,"name":"Mayanapa Group","description":{"languages":["es"],"texts":{"es":"Ernestina N. de 70 a\u00f1os trabaja con Pro Mujer hace aproximadamente 4 a\u00f1os, su comadre la hab\u00eca invitado a formar parte del grupo \u201cMayanapa\u201d que a su vez pertence al Centro Focal \u201cCollpani\u201d.

lives in a nuclear family with her husband and child in the Lafiabougou district of the city of San, region of S\u00e9gou (4th administrative region of Mali).\u00a0 Not having had the chance to attend school for long, she became interested at a young age in revenue-generating work, which she learned-by-doing on her own.\u00a0 These days, she excels in selling beauty products, which she embraced ten years ago.\r\n\r\nWith the goal of increasing her capital, Ms. Rokia turned toward the micro-finance institution Soro Yiriwaso five years ago.\u00a0 After five solidarity loans (group loans), all properly repaid, she is now on her first individual loan.\u00a0 With this loan, she intends to purchase a major stock of merchandise in Bamako and in Burkina Faso and to make sales in her shop at the

Garc\u00eda is 69 years old and has seven children who range in age from 35 to 50.  She lives in the neighborhood of Cachimbiro, which is an ancient indigenous settlement.  This area is known for the use of the \u201ccachimbo\u201d, a tobacco pipe maD. of ivory and wood maD. by native artists of Afro-Colombian origin.\r\n<p>\r\nNeila is a gracious woman who enjoys conversation.  At 69 years of age, she does not stop working because she wants to make improvements to her home on her own.  She plans to purchase new furniture and appliances because her current items need to be replaced because of constant use.  In order to earn money, Neila produces nurses\u2019 uniforms and bed linens through contracts and by direct request.  Her customers bring her the material and she takes measurements to determine the design of the uniform.  She also takes into consideration how the person wants to dress. \r\n<p>\r\nNeila has a sewing machine, but she still has to send out dresses for overlock stitching (in order to finish the edges).  She restarted this business four years ago.  Neila had stopped working in order to take care of her seven children and also her excessive schedule took a toll on her health.  In her previous business, she manufactured overalls and men\u2019s uniforms in mass quantity.  Now that her husband is retired and her children are working, Neila is more relaxed when she works.  She has no plans to quit because she has been sewing since she was 17 years old.  Prior to getting married, she studied dressmaking at an academy near her home.\r\n<p>  \r\nWith this second loan from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, Neila will be able to restart her business.  She learned about the organization from a co-worker of her daughter, who is a nurse and the co-signer of this loan.  The proceeds in the amount of 2,000,000 COP will be used to buy an <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Overlock\" target=\"_blank\" >overlock stitching machine<\/a>, which will allow her to finish the seams of her garments without having to pay extra for this service.\r\n<p>\r\nThe income generated from Neila\u2019s apparel business enables her to maintain the home where she lives with her husband, who is a pensioner of Avianca (the national airline of Colombia).  One of her unmarried daughters also lives with them and helps with the expenses.  Her other children contribute as well.   In addition to replacing the furniture, Neila wants to buy some durable appliances, such as a washing machine, that will make her daily chores easier and her home more pleasant.  Neila has a very peaceful life.  She loves her family and her hometown of Soledad, which is nationally recognized for being the birthplace of \u201cbutifarra\u201d, a sausage of Catalan origin that is a specialty of Caribbean coastal cuisine. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva

City. She earns her living by engaging in a dress shop and tailoring business.\r\n\r\nPacencia\u2019s 56 year old husband, Jose, helps his wife with the business and they have 6 children who are between 9-28 years old. Four of the children are currently going to school and also help their parents in the business as part of their daily chores. One is already married while the other one is working and helping Pacencia.\r\n\r\nPacencia joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2004 in the hope that she would be able to help her husband improve the quality of life for their family. With the help of her loans from NWTF-PD, she has been able to increase their family income by engaging in a clothes rental business and her tailoring. Now she earns an average monthly income of PHP 10,000 from her business activities.\r\n\r\nPacencia is a member of good standing. Her previous loan of PHP 29,500 was used to fund operations of her dress shop and tailoring business and it had a positive impact on both the business and the family\u2019s living conditions. Now she is borrowing for her 13th cycle loan, the amount of PHP 29,500, which she intends to use on her dress shop and tailoring business. Pacencia is working hard to achieve her dreams and aspirations for her family, which is to provide them with a brighter future and a more comfortable life.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress out of earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":558220,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Tailoring","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"Additional

Ana has a hardware store that sells spare parts and construction materials. Four years ago she was working as an employee at a warehouse of spare parts but she got sick and had to stop working there and begin a different job that would generate income and help her bring in money to be able to support her family. Now she has a small hardware store and she works from 7:00am to 11:00pm everyday. She sells tubes, paint, and construction materials.

She said that one day while she was in the shop, a car stopped by her shop and asked if there\u2019s any nearby Laundromat in the area.

This will give her an opportunity to earn additional income and contribute to development of farming sector in her region. If calfs will be well fed, then the buyer will be able to purchase quality product. To achieve all that, she needs to obtain a credit.

Una de las actividades que realiza con m\u00e1s frecuencia es la venta de tamales, los cuales son consumidos a la hora del desayuno, pues son unos deliciosos aperitivos a base de ma\u00edz con relleno de carne muy solicitados por las madres de familia. Do\u00f1a Juana hace 12 a\u00f1os se dedica a la preparaci\u00f3n de estos productos, pues tiene el don de la cocina y sus  tamales son lo mejor que sabe preparar, es por ello que son muy solicitados en los mercados y las ferias. Adem\u00e1s cuando ha habido oportunidad, los ha preparado para grandes eventos o ferias de gastronom\u00eda. Juana desea seguir preparando estos deliciosos tamales, pero su mayor limitaci\u00f3n es que no tiene una movilidad para trasladar sus productos a los diversos lugares donde tiene que entregar sus pedidos, es por ello que su m\u00e1ximo sue\u00f1o es adquirir un auto para movilizarse, minimizando de esta manera sus gastos de producci\u00f3n. Este es su d\u00e9cimo pr\u00e9stamo con MFP, y desea seguir perteneciendo a este grupo de trabajo, pues junto a sus amigas aprendieron administrar su dinero, ya que tienen autonom\u00eda para organizarse y desarrollar habilidades dentro de su banco comunal. Juana  tiene pensado invertir 3500, por lo pronto, en la compra de un molino para agilizar la preparaci\u00f3n de sus tamales, pues el que tiene es muy antiguo y necesita algunos repuestos.","en":"Juana is very tenacious with the things she does, as she supports three small children and is also responsible for their education, and can no longer count on the support of her partner, with whom she separated many years ago. One of the activities Juana does frequently is to sell tamales, which are eaten at lunch time. They are delicious snacks made with corn and filled with meat and are very sought-after by other mothers. <p>\r\n<p>\r\nJuana has been preparing these products for 12 years. She has a gift for cooking, and her tamales are the best she knows to make. It is because of this that they are so sought-after in the markets and fairs. She also has made them for large events and food festivals. <p>\r\n<p>\r\nJuana would like to continue to prepare these delicious tamales, but her biggest limitation is that she is unable to transport her products to fill her orders. Due to this, her greatest dream is to acquire a vehicle to move her products, minimizing the costs of production. <p>\r\n<p>\r\nThis is her tenth loan with MFP (a Kiva Partner), and she wishes to continue her membership with this group, as together with her friends, she was able to learn to administer her money, and she had the autonomy to organize and develop her skills with her community bank. Juana hopes to invest 3500 as soon as possible, to buy a new mill to speed the production of her tamales, as the one she has is very old and needs repair. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michelle Harrison, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":286887,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To buy a new mill for corn","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-03-17T01:40:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1100,"lender_count":43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-02-27T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-27T07:00:00Z","amount":384.4},{"due_date":"2009-04-27T07:00:00Z","amount":386.25},{"due_date":"2009-05-27T07:00:00Z","amount":408.4},{"due_date":"2009-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":423.23},{"due_date":"2009-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":445.83},{"due_date":"2009-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":463.66},{"due_date":"2009-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":483.73},{"due_date":"2009-10-27T07:00:00Z","amount":504.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":120.81},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":121.39},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.35},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":133.02},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":140.12},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":145.72},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":152.03},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":158.56}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":120.81,"local_amount":384.4,"processed_date":"2009-03-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:42:23Z","rounded_local_amount":388.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27117233},{"amount":121.39,"local_amount":386.25,"processed_date":"2009-04-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:52:53Z","rounded_local_amount":390.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36012148},{"amount":128.35,"local_amount":408.4,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T00:57:58Z","rounded_local_amount":412.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44595733},{"amount":133.02,"local_amount":423.23,"processed_date":"2009-06-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:44:39Z","rounded_local_amount":427.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52989996},{"amount":140.12,"local_amount":445.83,"processed_date":"2009-07-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:45:47Z","rounded_local_amount":450.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63211129},{"amount":201.06,"local_amount":639.75,"processed_date":"2009-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:29:38Z","rounded_local_amount":646.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73640636},{"amount":255.25,"local_amount":812.14,"processed_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:42:12Z","rounded_local_amount":820.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87080158}],"funded_date":"2009-03-17T04:24:50Z","paid_date":"2009-10-15T23:42:12Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Michelle Harrison","image":180524}},{"id":98729,"name":"Fanny","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Fanny es una mujer soltera, que a sus 25 a\u00f1os lucha por mejorar su futuro, vive en un cuarto que alquil\u00f3 cuando llego a Puno desde su natal Desaguadero (Distrito de Puno) y espera forjarse una buena vida.

Este es el cuarto pr\u00e9stamo al que accede Esteban con MFP, siempre ha sido puntual en sus pagos, ya que no quiere crearle problemas a su banco comunal, en el cual participa activamente y es un socio muy querido. Con los mil doscientos nuevos soles solicitados comprar\u00e1 nuevas llantas para su motocarro, ya que las actuales ya est\u00e1n muy gastadas.","en":"Esteban is 34 years old and a loving family man. He lives with he wife Silvia, 24, and his two small children Rosemary, 5, and Juan, just 9 months old. What he wants most is to give them a good life. His activity is passenger transportation, which is why Esteban spends his days looking for customers who want to take his motorcycle taxi. He gets up very early to do his job and stays working until late at night so that he can bring home money. He is aware that his family needs him and he is responsible for them.\r\nWhat he likes best about his work is talking to his passengers and helping them pass the time. He has been doing this for 9 years and thinks that the most difficult part of his work is having to leave his family all day, but he knows he has to do it to provide for them. In the future he hopes to buy a new motorcycle taxi to work with so he can have more income. This is Esteban\u00b4s fourth loan with MFP. He has always been on time with he payments since he does not want to cause problems for his communal bank. He actively participates in his bank and is a very well-liked member. With the money requested he will buy new tires for his taxi, since the ones it has are quite worn.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Molly Puglisi, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":375184,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Motorcycle Transport","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"Buy tires for his motorcycle taxi.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Juliaca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15.5 -70.133333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-08-23T00:00:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Esteban","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-08-06T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1200,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2009-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2009-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2009-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2010-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2010-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":200}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.84},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.84},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.83}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":70.83,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2009-09-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:32:12Z","rounded_local_amount":208.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87081224},{"amount":70.84,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2009-10-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:00:48Z","rounded_local_amount":208.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96997375},{"amount":70.83,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2009-11-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:53:21Z","rounded_local_amount":208.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103842719},{"amount":212.5,"local_amount":600,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T21:07:30Z","rounded_local_amount":626.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734301}],"funded_date":"2009-08-23T01:22:26Z","paid_date":"2010-01-15T21:07:30Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Molly Puglisi","image":null}},{"id":135636,"name":"Nguy\u1ec5n's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"X.

He is a farmer from the small town of Vodyanoye. There are basically no jobs to be found in this town which is why Alexander decided to try his luck in farming 10 years ago. He has constructed 5 big arch greenhouses to grow early spring vegetables and sell them wholesale. Alexander has already invested 70,000 Grivnyas in his business. Every year he spends about 10,000 \u2013 12,000 Grivnyas on seeds and polyethylene film to protect greenhouses. \r\n\r\nAlexander has recently purchased two farmland lots. He is seeking a loan of 10,000 Grivnyas to build one or possibly two greenhouses on his new property.

She lives with 48 year-old Adan and they have five children together.  They live with two of their children, 20 year-old Jos\u00e9 and 12 year-old Jeancarlos, in their own home, in the village of Palcamayo.\r\n\r\nArmanda goes out every day to grow peas and spinach on the three plots of farmland that she owns.  She cares for the plants, irrigates them and fertilizes them for approximately three months.  She then sells them in the central market in her village.  She says that there are seasons in which demand is higher and during those seasons she travels to the capital to sell her products at a higher price.\r\n\r\nArmanda was taught to work the land from an early age.  She knows when the growing seasons are, when to sell her produce and at what price.  During all these years, it has always upset her to see her crops fail owing to the constant frost that affects the south of the country.  However, she does not get discouraged.  On the contrary, she would like to continue working so that she can make progress, using modern technology to develop her pea and spinach crops.  She also learned how to fight pest infestations and produce better-quality products.\r\n\r\nFor now, Armanda has more incentive for her work as her young son is about to start a new level in his studies.  She plans to save more so that she can provide him with a good university education.\r\n\r\nArmanda is a member of the \"Patr\u00f3n San Crist\u00f3bal\" community bank and this is her tenth loan from MFP.

Today, BRAC has emerged as an independent, virtually self-financed paradigm in sustainable human development. It is one of the largest Southern development organizations employing over 100,000 people, 61% of which are women, and working with the twin objectives of poverty alleviation and empowerment of the poor. Diagnosing poverty in human terms and recognizing its multifaceted nature, BRAC approaches poverty alleviation with a holistic approach.\r\n<br><br>The successes of BRAC in the international development arena have stimulated a series of discussions, both with African delegations, who have visited BRAC programs, and with donors who work in Asia and Africa. Both the African countries and the donors have encouraged BRAC to join the development campaign in Africa to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and more recently to join the campaign of \u201cending poverty\u201d, which is an area where Africa represents the greatest global challenge.\r\n<br><br> In Uganda, BRAC registered as a Non Government Organization (NGO) in January 2006 to undertake programs in Education, Health, Water & Sanitation, Agriculture & Livestock and Microfinance. The Microfinance and Education are the pioneer programs launched in Uganda and, as of July 2007, had served 21,273 borrowers and enrolled 1,155 adolescents in its education

Previous loans have had meaningful effects in the lives of these people. The last loan they received from Kiva through SMT was for Le 1,000,000.00 each. Now they are requesting a loan of Le 1,200,000.00 each to enable them to further strengthen their businesses.\r\n\r\nMohamed D. (right) is the leader of the group. Mohamed is forty-two years of age. He was born in Sanda, about thirty-seven miles from Makeni. He is married to a businesswoman and the two have two children, both of whom are in primary schools. Mohamed sells slippers.  He has been in the business for over twenty-two years. He and his wife sell the slippers together.\r\n\r\nWith this loan, Mohamed will be able to buy at least three and a half cartons of slippers (100 pairs of slippers are in a carton). He has to travel to Freetown to buy the slippers. Freetown is 390 miles round trip from Makeni. In Freetown, a carton will cost him Le 300,000.

She rents from a relative with her husband and 4 children, Milagros (17), Luis (14), Kevin (10) and Antonela (16 months). She hopes to give them a good life. For Ursula, renting out dresses is more an enjoyable pastime than a job; since she was young she always enjoyed trying out and matching her sisters' clothing. She has a stand in a shopping gallery in the center of the city of Puno, in which she kindly and happily serves her customers. She has spent four years in this business and enjoys it very much, since she likes advising her customers which dress looks best on them. She hopes to own a large store in the future in which she would not only rent dresses but also sell children's clothing.

The income will allow him to take better care of his children's health, nourishment, and schooling.  \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

His wife Ana is his main support and between the two of them they work every day to improve their economic well-being.  They know that since they are young now they must do everything in their power to build a better future.  In the future, he wants to buy another car that he could rent out to obtain increased earnings and gradually build a better future for his family.\r\n\r\nRoberto has experience with loans from MFP; this is his 4th loan and his group does not have any problems, since all of his fellow members are very punctual with their payments.  With the money that he requests now he will refurbish his auto, which he owns.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Lisa Grobar, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":490546,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Taxi","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"to repair his auto","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-02-18T17:10:12Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":725,"lender_count":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Roberto","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-02-03T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2010-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2010-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2010-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2010-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2010-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2010-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2010-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.63},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.62},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.63},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.62},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.63},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.62},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.63},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":90.62}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":90.63,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:33:27Z","rounded_local_amount":258.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128993241},{"amount":90.62,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:38:10Z","rounded_local_amount":258.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136718024},{"amount":90.63,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:40:07Z","rounded_local_amount":258.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144751700},{"amount":90.62,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:03:02Z","rounded_local_amount":258.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151934165},{"amount":90.63,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:37:01Z","rounded_local_amount":258.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159672944},{"amount":90.62,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:40:05Z","rounded_local_amount":258.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166886728},{"amount":90.63,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:25:42Z","rounded_local_amount":258.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172153815},{"amount":90.62,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T15:14:44Z","rounded_local_amount":258.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177449214}],"funded_date":"2010-02-21T02:38:24Z","paid_date":"2010-11-15T15:14:44Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lisa Grobar","image":264298}},{"id":181427,"name":"Julia Amanda","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Esta cliente esta ubicada en la comunidad el espino y siempre se ha dedicado a la actividad agropecuaria\ny al desarrollo de su nivel de vida.\nEste credito le ha servido porque con las ganancia ha logrado comprar ganado y tambien preparar las condiciones para el desarrollo del ganado.","en":"\r\nThis client lives in El Espino;

The loan consultant who has been working with Ana over the past few months describes her as a humble, gentle woman who aspires to move up in the world.\r\n\r\nIn order to contribute to her family\u2019s income, Ana has a business selling various products including bags, clothing and sandals. This loan will be used to invest in the purchase of such products which Ana will sell to members of her community.\r\n\r\nAna sells her products from her house. When she makes sales on credits, her sons help her to collect on what is owed to her. One of her sons contributes to the family income and Ana also takes care of a child from the community in order to earn extra money.\r\n\r\nFor business advice, Ana consults her husband and sons, although she must execute all the daily tasks associated with her business on her own (her children are usually studying).\r\n\r\nAna would like very much to one day own a small restaurant or \u201csoda\u201d as they say in Costa Rica. She feels that such an enterprise would allow her to better provide for her children. She hopes to send as many of them as possible to university. In the meantime, Ana says business is going well and she hasn\u2019t had any problems yet.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1175,"image":{"id":575231,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The official name of this borrowing group is Marilyn R.'s Group.\r\n\r\nMarilyn is married and has two school-aged children. To make a living, she owns a general store selling a variety of different products.

She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from ASKI and is requesting a new loan of 7000 PHP to purchase additional products to sell. This will be the ninth loan taken out by Marilyn from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay the tuition fees of her children. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI: ASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 38 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

He lives with Dionicia, his wife of 20 years.  The couple have 6 children, but only 2 of their children live with them: Javier and Fresia, who are still under their care.  The family lives in their own house in the community of Tapo.  Ignacio was born in Anta, a distant town.  His desire to grow motivated him to move to Tapo, which is closer to the city.  It was there that he learned what is now his passion: agriculture.  His main crops consist of corn and potatoes.  However, Ignacio is a very wise man, and he also installed a small garden where he grows all kinds of vegetables that the family consumes as food, thus minimizing the household\u2019s food expenses.  Over time he has managed to acquire 6 parcels of productive land, which he cares for with great dedication.  He also owns sheep and cows, which he raises to sell at a higher price.  These activities are going very well, and he hopes that with enough water and light he can get what he needs to improve his quality of life.  Ignacio belongs to the \u201cSanta Rosa\u201d solidarity group and this is his first loan with MFP, and he hopes that by working with them his plans can become a reality.  He promises to make his payments on time, as he has done with previous loans.  He also enjoys being part of his group because all of the members are responsible people and very supportive.  If Ignacio receives your support he will invest the money he is requesting in purchasing natural fertilizers that he will spread on his cornfields.

This past year has been tough for her. She had previously owned a business in one of the local markets, but she lost her kiosk due to a reconstruction project. Not willing to give up, she decided to open a grocery business in an older area of the city where there are no new grocery stores. Many large supermarkets are being built in cities throughout Ukraine, but often small grocery stores close to where people live are much more convenient.<p>\r\n\r\nIrina had been a client with Nadiya Ukraine while she had her previous business. She established a good credit record and was able to obtain the necessary funding to start her new store. She has been in business at the new location for about 8 months. Her husband, Sergei, works closely with her and they are looking forward to seeing their enterprise continue to develop.<p>\r\n\r\nIrina has requested a loan for $900 that will allow her to increase the selection of goods she has available to sell. At this stage in her business development, it is important for her to offer a wide variety of items in order to establish a good reputation and attract more customers. This loan will enable her to continue building a solid foundation for her business so that it will be successful for many years to come.\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n\u0412 \u0406\u0440\u0438\u043d\u0438 \u0454
