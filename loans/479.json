Viquez, 48, lives with her husband and their two children in the El Sa\u00edno de Pital community, which is located in the Alajuela province.  Its principle productive activities are livestock and farming.  Cultivating pineapples stands out because these are mainly sold in international markets.  For that reason, the community development has been growing in the last few years.  This has generated a greater demand for products and services, which help to mitigate the effect of immigration.\r\n\r\nMarta has devoted the greater part of her life to taking care of her home.  She also helps her husband with the farming.  But, a little while ago she had the idea to have a mini- market (a small grocery store) to be able to sell, in her own house, basic products to her neighbors.  Her objective is to have a profitable economic activity to help improve her quality of life.  She says that having the business in her own house means she does not have to pay rent, which will help her get ahead in her business.\r\n\r\nShe currently needs a loan for \u00a2685.000 (six hundred eighty five thousand colones) to buy merchandise to sell.  That way she can start her business.  Specifically, she will buy basic groceries like rice, beans, vegetables, canned goods, soft drinks, soap, sweets, and everything that is referred to as the basic basket for Costa Ricans who live in the rural areas.  Marta says that the service she will offer is very important because there are no other mini-markets nearby in the region.  Therefore, she expects to have plenty of customers.\r\n\r\nMarta is a member of the Futuro Saino Communal Credit Union, which of one of the 100 members of EDESA in Costa Rica.  This will be her first loan, and she hopes to continue growing on a personal and economic level.  She also points out that thanks to this type of organization and their methods for facilitating loans, she can spend more time on productive activities.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from

It was once a key post along the Silk Road at the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\nIMON's History:\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients have a viable business opportunity. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He is 41 years old and married. He is the father of a 17-year-old, two 14-year-olds, and a 10-year-old, all of whom attend school. He only went to school through the 10th grade, and wasn't able to continue because of his family's difficult financial circumstances. He lives in his own house with his family, and also supports a nephew who lives with them.\r\nHe and his family left Manhi\u00e7a for Boane, also in Maputo Province, fleeing the war that devastated the country during the '80s. He's had his own business for more than four years. He doesn't have any employees, and sells blankets, microwaves, air conditioners, refrigerators, etc. He earns about 20,000 meticals a month, which is enough to cover household expenses with a little left over to keep in his savings account.\r\nHe's never received loans from other banks. He learned about Hvuluku through friends who are also Hvuluku clients. This is his second loan, in the amount of 25,000 meticals, which he will use to buy products (bathtubs, refrigerators, microwaves, etc.) to increase the amount of merchandise he carries.\r\nHe's committed to paying this loan off on time so that in the future he'll be eligible for others. He'd like to request additional loans to expand his business.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Andrea Rosenberg, Kiva

Elvira has a little store installed on a mobile cart, from which she sells snacks and signs. Her neighbors are her customers. Her husband is an expert in painting signs. The inscriptions mention the bus routes, and the people who buy these signs are the drivers and assistants on the bus lines serving the area. Previously, she and her husband both painted the signs, but now Elvira dedicates herself in the mornings to buying her snacks, to make sure her wagon will be well-stocked and attractive to her customers. She has done this work for 5 years; although she feels that the business can be a bit tedious, she doesn't complain, because she obtains good economic returns. Her greatest desire is to expand her business and later to acquire a permanent kiosk, so that her store will be more stable.

Microfinance institutions like ACCION USA support these \u201cunbanked\u201d small businesses by giving them access to fairly priced capital and business education. Small businesses also help stabilize low- to moderate-income neighborhoods and rebuild our economy through income growth and job creation. Self-employment provides workers with a way to increase their incomes, support their families, and strengthen their communities. The need for support of small businesses in the U.S. is great, and it is one that ACCION USA has been striving to meet since 1991.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1150,"image":{"id":668441,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"To

She is a cheerful and very dynamic woman who really enjoys working.  She finds a way of earning a living in everything she does.  Mar\u00eda is married and has six children.  They live together in their own home where they share family harmony and good habits.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda's business is selling candies as an itinerant street vendor.  Every day she sets herself up outside schools where her small customers seek her out to buy her products.  She carries out her work at different times of the day (mornings, afternoons and evenings) as these are the times that the students go to school and come home from school.  Mar\u00eda has been in this line of work for four years and, up to now, she has worked alone.  She very much enjoys this work as it gives her time to care for her children.  However, it is very tiring having to walk from one school to another.

This is 33-year-old Tusekile M. from Kyela. She is married with four children between the ages of 1 and 11. Additionally, she is responsible for supporting two dependents because they are orphans.\r\n\r\nTusekile has been running a charcoal business since 2007. These small, black dirty pieces of dry earth are important not just to charcoal sellers but to their customers, who rely on charcoal to cook their meals. Many Tanzanians still use small coal pots, in which they arrange mkaa (charcoal) and add either paper, dry grass, old plastic bags or kerosene in order to light them. \r\n\r\nThe fire requires constant fanning to ignite and maintain the flame, and makes cooking quite a hot and laborious task. It may not be the easiest or most environmentally friendly form of cooking, but it is the only option many people can afford. She works at the business for 9 to 12 hours per day, 6 days per week. Tusekile currently earns about $190 a month from her business. She is requesting a loan of $325 in order to purchase more charcoal in bulk. In the future, she plans to open another store of charcoal for reselling. Tusekile thanks you for your support!\r\n\r\nABOUT SELFINA:\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":237047,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fuel\/Firewood","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To purchase more charcoal in bulk to sell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Kyela","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-9.583333 33.85","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-12-11T00:20:14Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Tusekile H.

She is a young mother who comes from a hardworking family.  She lives in her own home together with her husband Linder and their two children, Densi, who is 5 years old, and Edy, who is only 1.  Gloria's greatest desire is to improve the quality of life for her children.   Her small butcher shop is located in the Las Mercedes market, the most important market in the city of Juliaca.   Her business is doing well.  She has many customers and almost every day she manages to sell what she planned.   This makes her happy, because she knows that the income will help improve her family's quality of life.   What she enjoys most about her work is the chance to talk with other vendors nearby about what's happening in the market.   Gloria has had this business for 8 years, and even though she has to work at her shop when it's intensely cold, she remains motivated and continues to work hard.   In the future, she would like to have a much larger butcher shop outside of the market, where she could generate more income.    This is the second loan from MFP, and she is very content to have received this support.   Gloria knows that she must make all of the payments on time so that the reputation of all the communal bank members is upheld.   With the money, she will purchase meat to stock her small business.  \r\n\r\n \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Emily Charnes, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":395152,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Butcher Shop","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To purchase meat for her small butcher shop","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Juliaca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15.5 -70.133333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-09-26T05:40:12Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gloria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-09-04T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2010-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2010-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":165}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-10-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:00:28Z","rounded_local_amount":167.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96997598},{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-11-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:53:05Z","rounded_local_amount":167.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103842947},{"amount":175.35,"local_amount":501,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T15:24:46Z","rounded_local_amount":503.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734522},{"amount":57.75,"local_amount":165,"processed_date":"2010-03-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:32:30Z","rounded_local_amount":165.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128992464}],"funded_date":"2009-09-26T05:59:41Z","paid_date":"2010-04-15T09:32:30Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Emily charnes","image":51249}},{"id":144308,"name":"Silvia Esperanza","description":{"languages":["es"],"texts":{"es":"Silvia Esperanza Garc\u00eda F. tiene 50 a\u00f1os, ella tiene mucho tiempo de trabajar con Fundaci\u00f3n Le\u00f3n 2000 por lo que su record crediticio es muy bueno.

She is a mother of one daughter and one son. Her husband Mumen (who appears in the picture as she is a conservative woman) is a Palestinian National Authority employee and a transport car driver.\r\n\r\nMumen transports goods in the city where he lives. Afinan took out a loan from FATEN as her husband wants to buy an engine and replace the one in his car as it is not working properly anymore.\r\n\r\nThe loan will help the family have a better income as Mumen will be able to transport more goods and over longer distances. \r\n\r\n\r\nAbout this loan product:\r\n\r\n FATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. \r\n\r\nIn order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

In addition their daughters continue studying. She lives at Kilometer 21 (El Palmer), in a wood house with two rooms. She has been selling vegetables in the 1st of April market for 4 years. Prior to that she sold American-style clothing but she assures us that vegetables are better and she can feed her family with this business. The client has various colleagues who offer the same products, her colleagues have larger stands and the success of her business is her persistence and responsibility as she has a steady clientele. The client will invest in her vegetable business, buying large potatoes (560 BS), small potatoes (200 BS), onion (140 BS) a case of tomatoes (60 BS) and other items (78 BS). The client will invest in these items as there isn\u2019t any more room for vegetables and she rotates her merchandise after a certain period of time. In addition part of the loan will be used to buy insecticide as she has planted some rice.

She is married and has 3 school-aged children.  To make a living, Onolina owns & operates a business venture in the agriculture sector, raising crops.  While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from planting & harvesting fruits & vegetables for sale.  Onolina has been engaged in this business for over 2 years and earns approximately 400 WST a month from these activities.<P>\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Onolina joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve  her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Onolina has successfully repaid a previous loan of 750 WST from SPBD.  This previous loan was used to purchase fertilizers such as manure.  Onolina is now requesting a new loan of 1500 WST which will be used to purchase additional seeds, seedlings & young crops to raise.  This will be the 2nd loan taken out by the borrower from SPBD.  Onolina plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business  to pay tuition fees for her children.<P>\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD:<P>\r\n\r\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.<P>\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She owns & operates a business venture, planting & harvesting taro for sale.  She has 1 year of experience in this business.    Aggieagnes needs a loan of WST $1000 to purchase weed-killers such as Gramoxome.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 200 talas or US $83 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Aggieagnes joined SPBD to gain access to financial services.  Most of SPBD's clients are unable to borrow from commercial banks, because they lack collateral.  This is Aggieagnes's 1st loan with SPBD. \r\n\r\nIn addition, SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"3 out of 3\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"2 out of 3\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"1 out of 3\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated. \r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAggieagnes's Overall Social Metric Score:*               1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.2 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.4 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              1.4 out of 3\r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem. \r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates

While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n<br>Ma. Teresa is 38 years old, married, and has two school-aged children. To make a living, she owns and operates a business venture in the food sector making and selling food. The main source of income for the business comes from selling fish balls and other dim sum to the local community. Ma. Teresa has been engaged in her business for over a year and earns approximately 3,000 PHP per month from these activities.\r\n<br>Ma. Teresa joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. She is requesting a loan of 5,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase raw ingredients needed to make products for sale. This loan will be her first from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business. \r\n<p>\r\n<b>About ASKI<\/b><br>\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas.

She thinks that commercializing her fishing business and expanding it will enable her to earn more revenue and be able to pay school fees for her children and cater to other family needs. With access to additional working capital through ASHI and Kiva, Ester is hopeful her dreams of sending her children to a university to complete their college degrees will be achieved.

R. lives in Barranquilla with his wife and young daughter.  He works as a security guard in a building to the north of the city, and he also sells general merchandise.  He started this business 2 years ago with a small amount of capital, and gradually his sales grew.  Most of his customers are employed as domestics, security guards and construction workers.  He provides his customers with 30 to 60 days of credit, and allows them to pay in 2 or 3 installments.  This is the second loan that Hugo has taken from the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, and his first loan with Kiva.  He plans to invest the money in the purchase of shirts, pants, jeans, blouses, shoes and perfume.  With the end of the year approaching, his orders have increased considerably.  His average monthly sales volume is $ 1,000,000 COP and his profit margin is approximately 35%.  Hugo states that for him it is an advantage to live very close to his customers, because it allows him to manage his collections effectively and maintain a default rate of 0 percent.  In addition, he avoids transportation expenses and saves time because he does not have to travel over long distances.  For next year, Hugo plans to buy some metal display cases where he can store and exhibit all of his merchandise, and if things go well, open a small variety store where in addition to clothing, shoes and perfume, he can sell gifts and stationery items.

T. is married and has three  children aged 30, 24 and 19.  In 1995, she established  her business selling cow's milk.  Working seven days a week and five hours each day, she supports her family.  Radhika has already received and repaid six loans from Patan BPW and used her most recent one to buy a young milk-giving cow.  In the future, Radhika plans to uplift the economic condition of her family.  She thanks you for your support. <p>\r\n\r\nDairy cows are an important source of nutrition and income in Nepal.  Cows are never raised for beef, but for their milk from which curd (duy) and fresh cheese (paneer) are made.  Jersey cows are the preferred breed for milking.  On average, a dairy cow in Nepal will produce about 10 liters of milk each day.  In the local market, a liter of milk sells for about USD $0.50.  In addition to producing milk, cows provide dung that is used in home construction, as fuel for fires, and can be captured in methane storage tanks.  The purchase of a dairy cow, made possible through a Kiva loan, is an investment that will repay itself many times over.  <p>\r\n\r\nThis loan was administered by Kiva's local partner MFI, Patan Business and Professional Women. Patan BPW became Kiva's first field partner in Nepal in 2007.  Patan BPW operates throughout the Kathmandu Valley, offering microcredit and business training programs to low-income women.  In addition to providing economic opportunity to their clients, Patan BPW seeks to empower Nepali women within the home and community.  <p>\r\n\r\nFor more information about Patan BPW, visit our

She has her business there where she prepares lunches, juice and fried fast food items.  She also takes advantage of her captive clientele to sell them telecommunication services.  \r\n\r\nHer business started out five years ago with a $20,000 COP loan from her father.

Her sales are cash and every day about 50 customers pass through Luz Marina\u2019s business and they buy from her primarily for cash.  Her goal is to enlarge the business and to do some home improvements because in future she plans to add a second story to separate the living quarters from the business.\r\n\r\nWhile Luz Marina works to reach her goals, she manages a profit margin of 47% from which we can project potential growth and augur a successful investment of her Kiva loan that she\u2019ll use to buy oil, rice, corn and other ingredients to prepare her lunches and she\u2019ll also buy chairs and tables to offer improved customer

Members of their Communal Bank are close friends and they say that, whenever a member gets sick or has some need, they support one another morally and financially. They mention that they started saving at their Communal Bank, as it was impossible to do it at home. This is Cleyde\u2019s case who, with her savings, managed to buy machinery for her business and a piece of land, and got married. Cleyde has a wood shop along with her husband, and she also runs a coffee shop at the Fine Arts School. On the other hand, Elizabeth has a sewing shop, where she makes women clothes. She was initially employed in a shop and, little by little, became independent and presently has all the necessary machinery. On her side, Justina has been selling food (potato and eggs) in the streets of downtown Ayacucho for the past 10 years. \r\n<p>Cleyde, Elizabeth and Justina are requesting a loan for soles 100, 800 and 600 respectively, which will be invested in the purchase of wood, plywood, glue, varnish, thinner, fabric, zippers, threads, knitting adhesive material, lace, elastic thread, potato and eggs. To expand the wood shop and buy all the needed machinery, to set up a store to sell and rent party gowns, and to register the property title of her land and see her children become professional are Cleyde\u2019s, Elizabeth\u2019s and Justina\u2019s respective dreams. \r\n<p> <b>Translated from Spanish by Leticia Britos, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\nCleyde tiene 38 a\u00f1os y 2 hijos, Elizabeth tiene 38 a\u00f1os y 1 hijo, mientras que Justina tiene 47 a\u00f1os y 2 hijos.

entrepreneurial endeavor with Esperanza International. The members of this group are very excited about receiving their loans and bringing new life to their businesses. They feel very thankful to be given the opportunity to receive a loan and improve their lives through their own work. \r\n\r\nYolanda P. V. is the group coordinator. She has four children who are all grown up (the youngest is 26 years old). However, they all still live with her and she supports them financially. Her business consists of selling clothing from her house. She purchases clothes in bundles, then sells the clothes, and this activity is what her first loan will be used for. If sales are good, she can sell them all in a month. This bundle will be entirely of children\u2019s clothing, not necessarily because it sells better, but, in Yolanda\u2019s words, \u201cBecause these are the clothes I like to sell.\u201d She thinks the fact that she dedicates her business to only the clothes she likes to sell will make her business progress.  She hopes in the future to buy and sell bundles with bedding (sheets and towels) as well as clothes for adults. \r\n\r\nMatelo C. is the group two coordinator. He has six children who are all living with him. He sells vegetables in a stand at a local market. He buys his vegetables from a large supplier in the same market and sells them in his small stand.  The vegetables he sells the most are carrots and eggplant. Eggplant is a popular food in Dominican Republic because it doesn\u2019t cost much, making it affordable when meat is too expensive.  Also, it serves as a good siD. dish with rice and beans, which is the traditional Dominican meal. Matelo thinks it\u2019s important for a stand in a market to look attractive so that customers are drawn to it. He also thinks a seller must be aware of his customers\u2019 demands because demands vary from person to person. He hopes this first loan with Esperanza International will help him increase his sales and help him set up a larger stand in the market.\r\n\r\nPlease help these new micro entrepreneurs launch their initiatives to generate income and improve their quality of life. On behalf of Esperanza International, thank you for your support!\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2250,"image":{"id":297302,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":336855,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"To purchase more clothes and to increase her capital.

He has dedicated himself to this business for over 12 years. He began this business because he enjoyed repairing electronic appliances, and also selling these types of appliances that are necessary in the home. In addition, he has a daughter that needs clothing and to further her studies, which is the reason that he wants to move forward with this business. His biggest obstacle has been that at times he didn\u2019t know his clients\u2019 addresses, which caused him to waste a lot of time given that he has to look for the exact address.

Romela is now 34 years old and lives in the village of Purok Camansi, Brgy. Mailum, Bago City, Negros Occidental with her husband who works as a security guard, and their three children.  The oldest is now 17 years old and is studying aeronautics, the second is 16 years old, and is in the fourth year of high school, and the youngest is 11 and is still in elementary school.\r\n\r\nWhen Romela married and got pregnant while still a teenager, her parents were disappointed because they thought all their dreams and aspirations for her would come to naught.  They were worried about how she would survive in the future. Acquaintances and relatives thought that she was throwing her life away. She proved all of them wrong by sheer will, determination and tirelessly working hard along with her husband to make a life for their young family.\r\n\r\nWhile she was pregnant with her first child, her parents decided to close their business of buying and selling firewood and bamboo poles. Seeing an opportunity to help her husband by earning her own living, Romela decided to take over the business operations that her parents were closing up. With only the small amount of capital that her husband could provide, she was able to continue dealing with the same suppliers.  She earned the loyalty of the same customers because they did not have to go somewhere else. By planning her cash flow well, she was able to maintain the business and slowly make it into a stable source of income.\r\n\r\nAfter several years, Romela saw that she needed to earn more if she was to provide her children with a better future. Her problem was where to find the necessary additional capital so that she could expand her business. When someone told her about NWTF-Project Dungganon, she immediately asked her husband's permission to join so that she could access the much-needed additional capital to increase her stocks of firewood and bamboo poles through loans that she could pay in weekly installments. \r\n\r\nHer business grew and she was able to increase her income, allowing her to afford her children's education and save for their future. She used her 3rd cycle loan to purchase a tricycle - a motorcycle with a side car - which she uses in her business, allowing her to make deliveries of the firewood and bamboo poles to her regular customers, increasing her income potential even further.\r\n\r\nIn the five years since she became an NWTF-Project Dungganon member, her business continues to improve and it earns approximately $225 a month for her family. Her previous loan - the 19th cycle loan amounting Php 10,000 - was used as additional capital for the business and it was fully paid on time without any delays.  For her 20th cycle loan she proposes to get the same amount of Php 10,000 as additional capital for her business. Her future plan is to expand her business and put up a general store.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the calling of not just of a few but thousands of women. Through the alleviation program, these women have progressed from earning less than a measly $1 a day, to surpassing the realities beyond their dreams. They have learned to live a life where they can finally be called honorable. This is Project Dungganon. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":393604,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fuel\/Firewood","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Additional capital ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Bago, Negros Occidental","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":145,"posted_date":"2009-09-27T00:50:15Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":225,"lender_count":6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Romela ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-09-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":769.23},{"due_date":"2009-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":769.23},{"due_date":"2009-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":769.23},{"due_date":"2009-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":769.23},{"due_date":"2009-10-29T07:00:00Z","amount":769.23},{"due_date":"2009-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":769.23},{"due_date":"2009-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":769.23},{"due_date":"2009-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":769.23},{"due_date":"2009-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":769.23},{"due_date":"2009-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":769.23},{"due_date":"2009-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":769.23},{"due_date":"2009-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":769.23},{"due_date":"2009-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":769.24}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17.31},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17.31},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17.3},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17.31},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17.31},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17.31},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17.3},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17.31},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17.31},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17.31},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17.3},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17.31},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17.31}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":18,"local_amount":800,"processed_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T00:29:14Z","rounded_local_amount":850.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87088406},{"amount":68.54,"local_amount":3046,"processed_date":"2009-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T04:07:28Z","rounded_local_amount":3237.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97004150},{"amount":75.47,"local_amount":3354,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:08:49Z","rounded_local_amount":3564.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103848921},{"amount":62.99,"local_amount":2800,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T16:01:17Z","rounded_local_amount":2975.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110739590}],"funded_date":"2009-09-27T02:55:23Z","paid_date":"2010-01-15T16:01:17Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Diane Bird","image":220084}},{"id":144340,"name":"Nancy","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"After many years as a stay-at-home mom, Nancy realized that she wanted her own career once her children were grown.

in a polygamous family with his six children and two wives in the Banankabougou neighbourhood, part of the Fana sous-pr\u00e9fecture, in the second administrative region of the Republic of Mali.\r\n\r\nMr. Seydou left school in the sixth grade (Mali education system) to embark on revenue-generating activities, in particular the commerce of cereals.\r\nSeydou is quite in demand and has acquired a solid reputation in buying and selling cereals.\r\n\r\nWith an eye on satisfying his ever-increasing customer base, he decided to join the Soro Yiriwaso MFI where he is at his fifth loan request, having correctly reimbursed the four previous ones. He wants to use this loan to buy eight tons of dry cereal (fonio, peanuts, beans, millet, and corn).\r\n\r\nHe gets his supplies locally at reasonable prices, in the town of Fana and in surrounding villages, and resells them when the products have increased in value. His store is located at the major market of Fana, and his customers are mainly resellers from the large cities.\r\n\r\nHe hopes to reach an average monthly profit of 50,000 FCFA, which will be used for family expenses and the remainder invested in his business.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Ren\u00e9 McConnell, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":491395,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"But cereals","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Fana ","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2010-02-20T09:00:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1050,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Seydou ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-01-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":1050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":55555.56},{"due_date":"2010-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":55555.56},{"due_date":"2010-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":55555.56},{"due_date":"2010-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":55555.56},{"due_date":"2010-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":55555.56},{"due_date":"2010-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":55555.56},{"due_date":"2010-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":55555.56},{"due_date":"2010-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":55555.56},{"due_date":"2010-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":55555.52}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.67},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.66},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.67},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.67},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.66},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.67},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.67},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.66},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":116.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":116.67,"local_amount":55555.56,"processed_date":"2010-02-21T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-18T08:48:57Z","rounded_local_amount":56363.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123991383},{"amount":116.66,"local_amount":55555.56,"processed_date":"2010-03-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-19T10:52:06Z","rounded_local_amount":56363.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":129021667},{"amount":116.67,"local_amount":55555.56,"processed_date":"2010-04-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T12:15:26Z","rounded_local_amount":56363.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136746456},{"amount":116.67,"local_amount":55555.56,"processed_date":"2010-05-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T10:03:35Z","rounded_local_amount":56363.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144778993},{"amount":116.66,"local_amount":55555.56,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:16:43Z","rounded_local_amount":56363.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151961200},{"amount":116.67,"local_amount":55555.56,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T12:01:31Z","rounded_local_amount":56363.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159699364},{"amount":116.67,"local_amount":55555.56,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:58:14Z","rounded_local_amount":56363.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166913291},{"amount":116.66,"local_amount":55555.56,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:41:01Z","rounded_local_amount":56363.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172180484},{"amount":116.67,"local_amount":55555.52,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T16:14:36Z","rounded_local_amount":56363.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177476528}],"funded_date":"2010-02-21T20:54:29Z","paid_date":"2010-11-15T16:14:36Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ren\u00e9 McConnell","image":467423}},{"id":181901,"name":"Sarah","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sarah G. is currently in the business of selling sugar and beer at home and is requesting a loan to stock more crates of beer to sell.

She is 35 years old, widowed, and the mother of two children, ages 12 and 9.  Both of them go to school.  Olinda finished seventh grade.  She had to quit when she became pregnant with her first child, but she is currently attending eighth grade.  She lives in her parents' house and is not responsible for anyone else.\r\n\r\nShe left Inhambane Province to go with her parents to Namaacha District on the border with Swaziland, where she began her studies, and stopped them when she married her husband, who passed away, leaving her with two children. Olinda's life was difficult owing to a dispute with her in-laws over property division, so she was kicked out of her own house and went to live with her parents.  Today she works at the Hotel Li Bombos as a waitress.  She has worked there for 16 years, working from 7:00 am until 3:00 pm and earning 1,600 meticais per month, which she uses for household expenses and cannot save anything, so she asked Hluvuku-Adsema for a loan to buy the title for her land and build a house on it.\r\n \r\nOlinda has never had loans from other banks.  She learned about Hluvuku from her father, who is also a customer of Hluvuku-Adsema.  This is her second loan from Hluvuku and her first with Kiva.  She will use this loan of 10,000 meticais to buy construction materials (loads of sand, cement and blocks) to begin building her house.  The earlier loan of 5,000 meticais was used to buy the title to her land. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Danielle Maxson, Kiva

They live together in a community located in the jungles of Cuzco, where they have their own wooden house.  She learned to work when she was very young and when she became pregnant, she continued working because she wanted to give her first child a better life and because she had the support of her family.  For the next three years, she worked for her father and learned the techniques for planting and harvesting.  As such, after some time, her father gave her a small plot so that she could farm and produce her own cacao and coffee, but her earnings were only enough to cover some of her family's basic necessities.  Nowadays, she has a grocery store and also continues to sell her agricultural products.  She sells her items from her home and mostly relies on the help of her children.

She was so enthusiastic about the rewards and sales promotions she could receive through the magazine that she signed up right away.\r\n\r\nShe has been able to add more variety to her range of products and not only sells through one catalogue but through four.  This is so she can offer her customers everything they need to their full satisfaction.\r\n\r\nIdalides is very successful because she is well-known in the area and has a lot of support from her husband who also helps her reach more customers in the neighborhood and among friends.  Her greatest challenge is to increase working capital so she can maintain sales and obtain earnings that allow her to cover university expenses for her children who range in age from 14 to 17.  One is about to begin college.\r\n\r\nIdalides V. takes full advantage of her location in the neighborhood since she is very near sports venues and many businesses there work together to keep a loyal customer base.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":718481,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To buy a display case, women's and children's clothing and cosmetics","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Cartagena de Indias","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2011-02-23T11:50:01Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":650,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Idal\u00eddes Isabel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-02-04T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1200000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":88359},{"due_date":"2011-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":91586},{"due_date":"2011-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":93341},{"due_date":"2011-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":95130},{"due_date":"2011-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":96953},{"due_date":"2011-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":98812},{"due_date":"2011-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":100705},{"due_date":"2011-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":102636},{"due_date":"2011-11-06T07:00:00Z","amount":104603},{"due_date":"2011-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":106608},{"due_date":"2012-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":108651},{"due_date":"2012-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":112616}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.86},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.61},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.56},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.53},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.51},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.53},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.55},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.59},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.66},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.75},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.85},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":47.86,"local_amount":88359,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:08:26Z","rounded_local_amount":89739.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201289288},{"amount":49.61,"local_amount":91586,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:05:01Z","rounded_local_amount":93017.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206157435},{"amount":102.09,"local_amount":188471,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:17:54Z","rounded_local_amount":191415.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211230446},{"amount":52.52,"local_amount":96953,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:09:12Z","rounded_local_amount":98467.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216509305},{"amount":53.52,"local_amount":98812,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-17T08:00:52Z","rounded_local_amount":100355.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227320082},{"amount":54.55,"local_amount":100705,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:06:28Z","rounded_local_amount":102278.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232803222},{"amount":112.25,"local_amount":207239,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:18:14Z","rounded_local_amount":210477.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238614305},{"amount":57.75,"local_amount":106608,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:59:42Z","rounded_local_amount":108273.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244568283},{"amount":58.85,"local_amount":108651,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:06:38Z","rounded_local_amount":110348.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250779629},{"amount":61,"local_amount":112616,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:36:08Z","rounded_local_amount":114375.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263324297}],"funded_date":"2011-02-26T04:45:27Z","paid_date":"2012-03-15T09:36:08Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sherry Bess","image":833485}},{"id":280328,"name":"My","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"My M. is 34 years old married man who makes a daily profit by selling.

She is very thankful to the Manuela Ramos movement (Kiva Field Partner) for helping women like herself to have opportunities to improve their income and to improve the quality of life for their families.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":783485,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Transportation","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"to purchase a motorcycle transport vehicle.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Tarapoto - San Martin","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-6.501389 -76.365556","type":"point"}},"partner_id":72,"posted_date":"2011-06-09T16:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":675,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-05-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1800,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2011-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2011-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2011-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2011-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2011-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":300}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":112.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":300,"processed_date":"2011-06-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:27:44Z","rounded_local_amount":310.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216543926},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":300,"processed_date":"2011-07-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T09:09:30Z","rounded_local_amount":310.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221712445},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":300,"processed_date":"2011-08-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T09:50:18Z","rounded_local_amount":310.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227082848},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":300,"processed_date":"2011-09-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:41:23Z","rounded_local_amount":310.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232844460},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":300,"processed_date":"2011-10-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:48:37Z","rounded_local_amount":310.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238659326},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":300,"processed_date":"2011-11-07T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:36:45Z","rounded_local_amount":310.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244613430}],"funded_date":"2011-06-15T20:51:21Z","paid_date":"2011-12-15T10:36:45Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":309015,"name":"Mary","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mary is a 59-year-old who is married and has eight children.

Mery has a large, close-knit family. Her three grown children live in the city of Huancayo, where they are studying. Mery lives with the other four in her own house in the district of San Pedro de Cajas. \r\n\r\n20 years ago, Mery opened a clothing and textiles workshop in her home to which she has dedicated her life ever since. Mery works hard and always manages to fulfill her orders. Due to her efforts in her business, she has been able to educate her children; three of them are now studying in college which makes her happy and proud. \r\n\r\nMery is an excellent manufacturer of garments such as woolen and cotton blankets, skirts, native dresses, and so on. When she picks up the thread and needle, her creativity flows and this is why orders continue to come in. Mery says, \"In December I have no time for anything, the work is exhausting, but I'm not complaining because I know it's good\". \r\n\r\nMery is currently working on an order of 250 blankets, which she estimates will be completed in two months. She sells each blanket for 10 soles. To help expedite the work, her children assist. Everyone has their own role, which could be to cut, sew, embroider, etc. This saves on paying staff to do these jobs. Mery has high hopes for her business, and will continue with her daily struggle as she still has young children whom she wants to see succeed.\r\n\r\nMery belongs to a community group, however due to the volume of orders she would like to obtain a loan from MFP. She therefore agrees to be punctual in her payments, as she has been on many previous occasions. The money will be invested in the purchase of fabrics of various qualities, brands and colors, with which Mery will make more blankets and clothing for use as costumes during the festival of the patron saint, which is a custom in the mountain districts of Peru.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":935473,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Textiles","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"to

They do not yet have children, and they live in their own home.  She owns a moto-car and works with her husband transporting passengers.  While he drives the taxi and gives rides to various people, at the end of the day, it is Lidia who administers the earnings.  They have been working this way for the past two years and have made good earnings despite the proliferation of moto-cars and with it, increased competition.  They work very hard to keep earning the income they need to cover their daily expenses.  This is the first time that Lidia has received a loan from Kiva partner MFP (Microfinanzas PRISMA), and she is very happy with her work with the communal bank.  She would like to learn from her loan officer and the rest of the members about ways in which she can improve her business.  With the loan she will repair the moto-car and with any that is left over she would like to make some structural repairs to her home.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Laura Westin, Kiva

This is her only source of income.      \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Christopher Knutson, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":975,"image":{"id":426199,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"Purchasing jeans, trousers, shirts, undershirts, blouses, skirts, shorts, socks, dresses, and clothing for infants","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"Tegucigalpa","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"14.1 -87.216667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":118,"posted_date":"2009-11-14T06:00:11Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":975,"lender_count":31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Claudia Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-11-13T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":18000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":975,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":1500},{"due_date":"2010-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":1500},{"due_date":"2010-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":1500},{"due_date":"2010-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1500},{"due_date":"2010-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1500},{"due_date":"2010-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1500},{"due_date":"2010-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1500},{"due_date":"2010-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1500},{"due_date":"2010-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1500},{"due_date":"2010-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1500},{"due_date":"2010-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1500},{"due_date":"2010-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":1500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":243.75,"local_amount":4500,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:29:03Z","rounded_local_amount":4605.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118142170},{"amount":81.25,"local_amount":1500,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:53:25Z","rounded_local_amount":1535.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":129010572},{"amount":81.25,"local_amount":1500,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T12:04:32Z","rounded_local_amount":1535.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136734938},{"amount":162.5,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:55:53Z","rounded_local_amount":3070.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144768397},{"amount":81.25,"local_amount":1500,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-16T07:48:49Z","rounded_local_amount":1535.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":152085862},{"amount":81.25,"local_amount":1500,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-16T09:16:43Z","rounded_local_amount":1535.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159799732},{"amount":81.25,"local_amount":1500,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:52:56Z","rounded_local_amount":1535.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166904914},{"amount":81.25,"local_amount":1500,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:36:59Z","rounded_local_amount":1535.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172172815},{"amount":81.25,"local_amount":1500,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T15:58:51Z","rounded_local_amount":1535.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177468887}],"funded_date":"2009-12-03T02:05:49Z","paid_date":"2010-11-15T15:58:51Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Chris Knutson","image":1448752}},{"id":156757,"name":"Sophea","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mr. Sophea S., 26, and his wife, Mrs. Kea Chanmakara, 28, live on an Island of Mekong River about 15 kilometers from Phnom Penh, the capital city of Cambodia.

She owns a business venture, selling a variety of different products in the local community.  Lagi has 7 years of experience in this business.  Lagi needs a loan of WST $1000 to purchase additional products to sell.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 700 tala or US $292 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2006, Lagi joined SPBD.  This is her 4th loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Lagi's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Lagi P. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.8 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              2 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         2 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The main source of income for the business comes from selling a variety of fruit in the local community.

Emelita is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP, which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This loan will be her 3rd loan from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement her family\u2019s income.\r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is an accredited partner of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She has been in this business for 6 years and she comments that she does well because she\u2019s had income.\r\n\r\nShe was inspired in this activity because she wants to support her husband contributing to household income and have what is most necessary for her family and together with her husband get ahead.\r\n\r\nShe saves the profits from her sales to buy more ingredients she needs for her activity but also to have enough to be punctual with her repayments so that she will not have any problems with FRAC because she needs its support to be able to work.\r\n\r\nHer dream is to manage to support her children who are growing up and provide them with schooling so that they will finish careers they can depend on when they are grown.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":825,"image":{"id":665100,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"  To buy ingredients to make donuts, cakes, chicharrines (crispy fried dough snacks), among others.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"COPAINAL\u00c1, CHIAPAS","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2010-12-21T16:30:11Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":825,"lender_count":30,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Mercedes","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-12-06T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":825,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":1475.43},{"due_date":"2011-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":1544.62},{"due_date":"2011-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":1648.77},{"due_date":"2011-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1694.42},{"due_date":"2011-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1779.4},{"due_date":"2011-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1857.36}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":121.72},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":127.43},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":136.03},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":139.79},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":146.8},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":153.23}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":121.72,"local_amount":1475.43,"processed_date":"2011-01-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T03:44:10Z","rounded_local_amount":1512.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191430755},{"amount":127.43,"local_amount":1544.62,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:45:08Z","rounded_local_amount":1583.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195850014},{"amount":136.03,"local_amount":1648.77,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:10:52Z","rounded_local_amount":1690.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201292287},{"amount":139.79,"local_amount":1694.42,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:09:02Z","rounded_local_amount":1737.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206160556},{"amount":146.8,"local_amount":1779.4,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:22:34Z","rounded_local_amount":1824.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211233479},{"amount":153.23,"local_amount":1857.36,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:12:19Z","rounded_local_amount":1904.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216512370}],"funded_date":"2010-12-21T21:30:04Z","paid_date":"2011-07-15T11:12:19Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":263954,"name":"Kototala Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Les membres du groupe Kototala sont des femmes mari\u00e9es, elles ont en moyenne 35 ans, 3 enfants et vivent avec leurs maris et enfants dans des familles traditionnelles \u00e9largies dans le village de Coulibalyla, pr\u00e9fecture de Dio\u00efla, R\u00e9gion de Koulikoro (deuxi\u00e8me r\u00e9gion  administrative de la r\u00e9publique du Mali).\nElles se sont connues \u00e0 travers des liens de parent\u00e9, de voisinage et font le commerce de poissons, de condiments, des fruits, des tubercules et d\u2019articles divers.                                                                                     \nLes femmes du groupe Kototala sont \u00e0 leur premier pr\u00eat solidaire avec Soro Yiriwaso.\nWAWA D. s\u2019approvisionne quotidiennement en fruits avec les revendeurs de Dio\u00efla.

She lives in the town of Catunrumi, Pichari, where she has her own home. At a very early age, she lost her mother and at age 19 she met the father of her three children, though some years later he abandoned them. There were moments of despair, but little by little she managed to pull herself up thanks to the help of her siblings and friends. \r\n\r\nThey pulled together some money to provide her with a loan, with which she launched a small business in her house. She now sells children's clothes for children under age six. When someone visits Maximiliana's store they are surprised by the orderliness and the way she displays her clothing.

She depends on the support of her husband who works in a finca around 15 kilometres from their suburb.  She is in charge of managing the family budget, and is asking for financing through their fifth loan in order to invest the money in improving their house (finishing the plastering and laying the floor).  She has worked as a teacher for the past 10 years, and also meets the expenses of her parents as they have very few economic resources and many commitments.

She is starting a business venture, planting & harvesting cabbage, tomatoes, and cucumber.    Faataumamate needs a loan of WST $1000 to purchase additional seeds, seedlings & young crops to raise.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 300 talas or US $125 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\n\nIn 2009, Faataumamate joined SPBD to gain access to financial services.  Most of SPBD's clients are unable to borrow from commercial banks, because they lack collateral.  This is Faataumamate's 1st loan with SPBD. \n\nIn addition, SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"3 out of 3\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"2 out of 3\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"1 out of 3\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated. \n\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\n\nFaataumamate's Overall Social Metric Score*:                2 out of 3\nLevel of Education:                              2 out of 3\nLevel of total Household Income:         2 out of 3\nQuality of Household Assets:              2 out of 3\n\nAbout  SPBD \nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem. \n\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low- income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.
