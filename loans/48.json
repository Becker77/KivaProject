With this loan she will buy more bracelets, necklaces and rings from the nearby town of San Pedro to sell in her store. \r\n<p>\r\nMiguelina has successfully completed five loan cycles and is excited at the possibility of increasing her business even more. With her past loans, Miguelina has been able to keep her children well fed and healthy. Her dream is to one day own her own house and make enough money to send her children to college. With this loan she will be one step closer to achieving her dreams.\r\n<p>\r\nMiguelina is the leader of the group <i>Unidos Para Progresar 1<\/i> (Progressing Together) which takes out microloans as a group in Hato Mayor, Dominican Republic.

Products on her shelves range from soap bars to candies and energy drinks to rice. Also, she has an alkaline water-making machine with which she adds to the income of the family. Having been at least five years in business, she knows how to pay her dues on time. She also has an excellent reputation with her fellow community partners in CCT* and, most important, her customers. Monthly, she is able to earn an average of 10,000 Philippines pesos (Php).\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operation of her business, she is requesting a Php 44,000 loan. She intends to use this money to purchase more products for her store, all the more now that the Christmas season is fast approaching. She also plans to charge up her alkaline water business so that it will also become profitable. Esnarda plans to take this opportunity to drive her businesses toward more profitability.\r\n\r\nEsnarda's life is never without challenges, both in her business and personal life. Nonetheless, she stays focused on the opportunities that lie ahead, and not on the failures of yesterday or the worries of today.\r\n\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital and repay micro-finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":672555,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

She is married and has two school-aged children.  To make a living, H\u01b0\u1eddng owns & operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising livestock.  While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes  from raising ducks for sale.  H\u01b0\u1eddng has been engaged in this business for over five years and earns approximately 6,000,000 VND a month from these activities.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 2008, H\u01b0\u1eddng joined SEDA to gain access to financial services to help improve  her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  H\u01b0\u1eddng has successfully repaid a previous loan of 8,288,000 VND from SEDA.  This previous loan was used to purchase livestock feed & other supplies.  H\u01b0\u1eddng is now requesting a new loan of 9,632,000 VND which will be used to purchase poultry feed & other supplies.  This will be the 5th loan taken out by the borrower from SEDA.  H\u01b0\u1eddng plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business  to improve\/expand her business.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout SEDA:\r\n\r\nThe mission of SEDA (Center of Small Enterprise Development Assistance) is to provide micro-finance services to the low income and disadvantaged people in rural areas of Hanoi and the Northern provinces of Vietnam.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She was able to invest in new merchandise as she planned, but once she was able to save enough money she decided to venture into a new and more profitable business. Johanna now owns a small restaurant where she makes lunch and dinner. She is happy with the change in her life as she has been able to make more money.<p>She is now seeking a second loan so that she can invest in her restaurant. Although she has a steady client base, she wants to attract new people by improving the appearance of her business. She will invest in utensils, chairs, tables and other necessary items for a restaurant. <p>Johanna is raising her two daughters on her own. Her husband left to go to Spain about a year ago because he could not find work in Ecuador. She lives with her mother who helps her take care of the children when she is out working.

In fact, if you are a regular lender on kiva.org, you may be tired of reading about kuku, the Swahili word for \u2018chickens.\u2019 Raising them for sale is popular for a number of reasons. Firstly, they require little start-up capital. You can start with one or two, and either add to them as you go, or wait for them to multiple naturally! Secondly, they require little space, so sometimes you can just let them run around in your garden or compound. Thirdly, while they are growing they produce eggs, which can either be sold to provide a supplementary source of income, or eaten to provide a supplementary source of protein. I\u2019m sure there are hundreds of other reasons raising kuku is so popular (maybe they are friendlier than other animals?

Her story is just one of a list of men and women who are improving their quality of life through the help of micro-credit loans of Esperanza. Together, this group has united with a common vision of a better life with faith and hope in their hearts and an unbreakable spirit. The concept of group lending is to have loans paid in a group to reduce the risk of a person defaulting, as others pick up where a person may lag to receive the next loan.

She only makes a daily income of around $5 each day to help meet the family's expenses. She is married with three children; all three of whom are teenagers and under her care, whilst her husband, Sean, 54, works as a staff member for a ministry of telecommunication. S.'s investment is going well because it is a profitable investment for the family. To enlarge the business, she is asking for a loan to buy additional rice stocks to sell. \r\nThe other two borrowers are:\r\nS., 26, who sells groceries.

This led to reductions in many industrial enterprises, factories, shops and plants, leaving many people without work to this day.  Jibek K., the group leader, well understands this fate.  She is an optimist during the storm and courageous at heart.  Jibek and her girlfriends felt the spirit of their time and decided to trade at the market.  At that point in time, Jibek had only two hundred som ($10) to begin her business.  Besides, Jibek is a widow and had to raise her four children.  They have grown up and she has helped them to get on their feet.  The older son is twenty-nine years old. He  is married and lives separately with his family. One daughter is twenty-eight years old.   She works in Kazakhstan.  Her second daughter is twenty-five.  She is working in Russia.  The youngest son is sixteen.  He lives with Jibek  and helps her in the market. They sell confectionery products and eggs. Within fourteen years, Jibek and her children, by working together, were able to buy a partial house and complete it.   Jibek has also bought a dorm room in Bishkek for one of daughters.  Jibek and her younger son supported themselves with trade and did not require material support from her other children.  Jibek does not wish to burden her children. However, she needs a bit of money to put back into the business.  She hopes that a loan will increase sales.  In the future, Jibek  would like to improve her shop and eventually to buy her second daughter an apartment.  \r\n\r\nJibek's partners include:\r\n\r\nGulmira is forty-five years old. She has one son. Gulmira's husband is a veterinary surgeon. Gulmira works buying and selling eggs.  Gulmira needs this loan to repair her car.  \r\n\r\nGulnara is forty-four years old. She is divorced.  Gulnara has four children. All of her children except the youngest daughter work in Bishkek. Gulnara  works in sales and fattening sheep. Her monthly income is six thousand som.  Gulnara need the loan to buy feed.\r\n\r\nBurma is forty-six years old. She is a widow.  Burma has two children. Her older son works in construction, and the younger one goes to school. Burma works selling eggs.

W. is 33 years old, single, and has no children. Her business is located at the Nairobi Central Business District. She sells clothes such as jeans, women's suits, blouses, and shoes. Her clients include both men and women. She says that this business is profitable. Her only major challenge is that the business is seasonal, so sometimes her business is slower and she makes less profit. However, she works very hard every day from early morning to late evening to keep her business doing well. She is using her loan of 50,000 KES to buy more clothes in preparation for the Christmas holiday. In the future, she hopes to grow her business and open more outlets while importing the clothes. She describes herself as a very hard-working lady."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":660453,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing

She says the good work of Juhudi Kilimo is uplifting the living standards of her children. \n\nTo Janet, high cost of animal food is a major challenge."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":947795,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy poultry birds.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Murang'a","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2011-12-16T21:30:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Janet","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-12-07T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":30000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":16,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":2157.05},{"due_date":"2012-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":2214.05},{"due_date":"2012-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":2273.05},{"due_date":"2012-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":2333.05},{"due_date":"2012-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":2394.05},{"due_date":"2012-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":2458.05},{"due_date":"2012-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":2523.05},{"due_date":"2012-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":2589.05},{"due_date":"2012-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":2658.05},{"due_date":"2012-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":2728.05},{"due_date":"2013-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":2800.05},{"due_date":"2013-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":2872.45}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.17},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.83},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.52},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.21},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.93},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.68},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.44},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.2},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.01},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.83},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.67},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.51}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":75.32,"local_amount":6455.95,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-16T08:15:41Z","rounded_local_amount":6695.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270275958},{"amount":16.07,"local_amount":1377.65,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-16T08:45:09Z","rounded_local_amount":1428.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276904649},{"amount":28.16,"local_amount":2414.07,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-16T08:34:59Z","rounded_local_amount":2503.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283524146},{"amount":28.91,"local_amount":2477.88,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-16T08:24:51Z","rounded_local_amount":2569.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287612790},{"amount":29.67,"local_amount":2543.38,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-16T08:55:48Z","rounded_local_amount":2637.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294599661},{"amount":30.46,"local_amount":2610.61,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:38:38Z","rounded_local_amount":2707.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301435048},{"amount":27.18,"local_amount":2329.62,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:18:19Z","rounded_local_amount":2416.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308435298},{"amount":31.98,"local_amount":2741.2,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-17T10:08:35Z","rounded_local_amount":2843.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315823838},{"amount":32.83,"local_amount":2813.65,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T14:43:57Z","rounded_local_amount":2918.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323031580},{"amount":49.42,"local_amount":4235.99,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-18T08:52:47Z","rounded_local_amount":4393.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347304184}],"funded_date":"2011-12-19T06:08:58Z","paid_date":"2013-03-18T08:52:47Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sarah Salwen","image":812309}},{"id":374840,"name":"Srey","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Srey and her husband, Sos, are rice farmers.

He will be selling the calves after 40-45 days of feeding and use the money to purchase new animals. Mr. M. will use the profits made from his business to support his family, since the salary of a security guard is very small and is not sufficient for basic human needs.

Salama is grateful for her loans for the four years she has been in this association and this time round, she needs a loan to help her buy more weaves, braids and chemicals for her salon since most of them were used up during the festive season."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4325,"image":{"id":253079,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty

In the middle of the year, which is a large harvest, she goes to the capital, where she sells the food she produces at a high price.  She also raises livestock; she plows the land with the help of her two bulls, and sells the milk her two cows produce.  She does all of these activities with the help of her husband, who not long ago began a grocery business, where he sells staple products to people who live in the area.

The business brings in annual income of 40,000,000 Vietnamese Dong. She has 3 children, one of whom is still going to school.

She is married and has four children. She joined the credit union in January 2010 and has never taken out a loan. She has been selling vegetables (tomatoes, carrots, etc.) for a very long time. For the past four years, she has also been selling water from a public faucet. The management of the public water faucet was assigned to her by the chief of the village and provides her with significant revenues. Mrs. N. was embezzled of her monthly cash payments by the person she had asked to stand in for her while she was away. As a consequence, she is requesting a loan of 150 000 francs to settle her overdue bill. This loan will allow her to resume the sale of water to families in the neighbourhood. \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Joanne Archambault, Kiva

She lives in Toledo City, Cebu. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2003 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her soft drinks and water refilling businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 9,600. Elsie is borrowing PHP 15,000 to fund her business operations. This will be her sixth loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 9,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Elsie aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future wellbeing by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

She leaves home very early every morning to be able to secure her supplies, and she works throughout the day in hopes of providing a better life for her three children. Two of them are in school, and the oldest one is intensely preparing at a prep school to attend a university and study accounting. Due to the demands of her children's education, she decides to sell candy and other treats at the most popular place in town.

While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is Ma. Susan S.\u2019s Group.\r\n\r\nMa. Susan is married and has three school-aged children. She owns and operates a general store, selling a variety of different products in the local community. She has been engaged in her business for over five years and earns approximately 30,000 PHP a month.\r\n\r\nMa. Susan joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 18,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional products to sell.\r\n\r\nMa. Susan is requesting a new loan of 20,000 PHP which will be used to invest in expanding her business. This loan will be her eighth from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business. \r\n\r\n\r\n<b>About ASKI:<\/b>\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has twenty-one branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas.

With a Kiva loan, BPW's borrowers are able to purchase greater amounts of seed and fertilizer.  With more seeds and fertilizer, a borrower is able to grow cash crops to be sold in the local market. Such crops allow households to move beyond subsistence and provide much-needed cash income throughout the year. \r\n\r\nThis loan was administered by Kiva's local partner MFI, Patan Business and Professional Women.
