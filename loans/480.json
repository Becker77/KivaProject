They are local entrepreneurs in the town of Makeni, and they have already received several loans from Kiva through SMT.  Such previous loans provided a great deal of assistance to the members of this group: they enabled the members to expand their businesses and to generate more profit; accordingly, the loans worked to improve the living conditions of both group members.  Having successfully repaid their last loan, they are hereby requesting another loan in the amount of $650 total (1,000,000 SLL each). <p>\r\n\r\nAminata, pictured on the left, is the leader of the group.  She is 42 years old, and she was born in Sanda Loka, a series of small towns in northern Sierra Leone.  She is married, and her husband is a professional teacher.  They have five children: one child is married, one is in Senior Secondary School III (SSS III), one is in Junior Secondary School (JSS), one is in primary school, and their last child is not old enough to attend school.  Aminata sells food items such as palm oil (the most popular cooking oil in her area) and rice.  In addition, she sells firewood from their home.  With the proceeds from this loan, Aminata is hoping to diversify her business by purchasing dishes and cotton for resale purposes. <p>\r\n\r\nAminata thanks God for her business.  She explains that her business is doing well, and that she enjoys operating her business.  Her goal is to grow her business in such a way that she could generate a sufficient amount of income to build her family a house.

","en":"The group, \"the 6th of August\" is represented by Lorgia and maD. up of 15 very responsible and capable members who have shown in the past two cycles that they have a lot of experience and are people who have much desire to get ahead and to continue growing thanks to the help offered them by the institution.  \r\n\r\nEach one of the members has different activities like selling clothing, cosmetics, promoting magazines, selling food, firewood, phone cards and providing services like scooter repair and in the case of Lorgia, who works making baked goods.  Usually, she makes them very early -   pastries, salte\u00f1as (meat empanadas), cu\u00f1apes (bread roll with cheese and yucca), and empanadas - in the door of her house.  She is married, but what her husband earns isn't enough to support their 4 children and that's why she works - for at the education of her children and to pay the utility bills.  But, she would like to have an industrial oven to be able to make more pastries and to go to the local fairs to sell them and make better money to give her children a better quality of life.  It's for this reason that she requires a loan to be able to purchase their oven.  \r\n\r\nLike her, the other members would like the loan to increase their investments, merchandise and their working capital to be able to better their earnings and be able to give their families a better quality of life.  \r\n\r\nAs to competition, it can be mentioned that if this loan is granted, the members don't allow being intimidated by it.  They know that the products that they offer and the experience is enough help. The greatest expectation that the members have is to grow their businesses in a way that their families aren't in need of anything and they can proviD. them more comfort in their homes. . <br

They live in the community La Victoria del Portete, which is known for its plains and fields, as the majority of the area\u2019s population works in agriculture and animal husbandry.  The residents of the area are strong people with a good work ethic, like the group\u2019s members.\r\n\r\nMrs. Rosa T., a member of La Victoria community bank, is going for her second loan, having been invited by another member.  She has been doing domestic work in other people\u2019s homes for 10 years, and she works from 7:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m.  She also raises chickens, which she sells in her community, and cows; she must get up very early to go milk her cows before going to work.  With these jobs, she has earned enough income to provide her family their daily bread, and also to help her husband with household expenses.  \r\n\r\nRosa is 30 years old, and she lives with her common law husband and their three children, who are studying in a school in the community.  Her husband works in agriculture; he is a widower and has inherited the house of his deceased wife, in which they currently live.  Rosa will invest the loan in the purchase of a horse so that she will be able to better take care of her livestock up on the hill.  Her goal is to have more livestock and be able to have a larger source of income.\r\n\r\nMrs. Mar\u00eda P\u00e9rez is 50 years old, and she has been a widow for 20 years. She has two children.  Her eldest son is 28 years old; he works and helps his mother financially.

She works Monday to Saturday, from eight in the morning until six in the evening, and she also raises guinea pigs.  She has been a member of the community bank for eight years, and the bank\u2019s loans have helped her to expand her guinea pig business.  She will invest this new loan in the purchase of chickens, as she would like to begin a chicken business.  Her goal is to put an addition on her house, and also to have drinkable water inside her home.

The two of them live in her parents' house in the village of Santo Domingo. She has had a lot of responsibilities ever since she was young, since she had to face the obligations of becoming a mother. Twelve years ago she began growing potatoes, peas, beans, and lettuce on her own lands, which were passed down to her by her parents. She works in the fields every morning and also raises cows, pigs, and sheep, fattening them up so she can sell them at a higher price. She also makes cheese with the milk from her cows,  which earns her an additional 30 to 40 soles a week. Now she is getting ready to harvest the corn and lettuce crops, which will take place within a month so she can have good sales. She belongs to the village bank Santo Domingo de Tapo, and this is her first loan with MFP. She is very grateful for the opportunity they've given her to improve her lot in life. Susy is planning to plant peas, and will use the loan to buy seed and bags of organic fertilizer. She has already prepared the land for planting.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":764744,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"purchase seed and bags of organic fertilizer.

\n\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\n\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She worked hard and learned the trade while studying fashion design when she arrived from the municipality of Ayape in the department of Cordobal, where she was born. Cordoba is well-known for its livestock rearing par excelence. Not everything has been easy for Lercy, a mother of 2 children aged 9 and 19 years. She had to work hard to overcome life's challenges and with her garment business has managed to get ahead. She started her business 15 years ago after finishing her training, sewing made-to-measure clothes for her first customers who were her neighbours, friends and relatives. Subsequently she perfected her craft to set up her best company as it not only generates income which ensures the well-being of her household but also generates jobs as 2 women work for her and form a part of her operations; although Lercy is the one who works the most as she says she has no schedule. Currently alhtough she sees clients one-on-one, about measurements, she also has contracts with schools in the city and in her native Ayapel. Her infrastructure has grown little by little, from her simple  sewing machine to having 3 industrial type machines. She is currently applying for her first loan with Kiva with which she will buy an industrial type machine to optimize production times and increase production. She will also invest in fabrics to make grade dresses, garments for a contract she won in the department of Cordoba.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":934754,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to

small-scale relief and rehabilitation project in 1972 to help the country overcome the devastation and trauma of the liberation war and focused on resettling refugees returning from India. Today, BRAC has emerged as an independent, virtually self-financed paradigm in sustainable human development. It is one of the largest Southern development organizations employing over 100,000 people, 61% of which are women, and working with the twin objectives of poverty alleviation and empowerment of the poor. Diagnosing poverty in human terms and recognizing its multifaceted nature, BRAC approaches poverty alleviation with a holistic approach.\r\n<br><br>The successes of BRAC in the international development arena have stimulated a series of discussions, both with African delegations, who have visited BRAC programs, and with donors who work in Asia and Africa. Both the African countries and the donors have encouraged BRAC to join the development campaign in Africa to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and more recently to join the campaign of \u201cending poverty\u201d, which is an area where Africa represents the greatest global challenge.\r\n<br><br> In Uganda, BRAC registered as a Non Government Organization (NGO) in January 2006 to undertake programs in Education, Health, Water & Sanitation, Agriculture & Livestock and Microfinance. The Microfinance and Education are the pioneer programs launched in Uganda and, as of July 2007, had served 21,273 borrowers and enrolled 1,155 adolescents in its education

For the past 6 years he has earned his livelihood driving a mototaxi (motorized vehicle used in the transport of passengers and cargo).  He began with a leased one and, after much effort, was able to buy his own.  As time went by, he saved up again and bought a second unit, which is operated by a relative.  Usually, he transports his customers within the same area and even takes them to nearby cities and towns.  The profits from this work is his only stable source of income to support his family.  He tells us that during the Christmas season he buys panetones (an Italian sweet bread which is a Christmastime staple) which he distributes among the towns around his district.  The Christmas season has already begun and he thought it convenient to request help, for the first time, from Edpyme Alternativa, in the form of a 1000 new sol loan to start this activity again.  His greatest desire is to set up a grocery stall in the city market and to acquire a lot where he can build his own house.

He is married to Rosanna D., a variety store owner, and is the father of two children, both of whom are already in college. By the grace of God, Rodel has managed to support his children's schooling up to the college level. This is a dream come true for most Filipino parents like Rodel, as he himself has been to college and believes that a college diploma is the best inheritance parents can leave to their children.\r\n\r\nRodel operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store selling groceries, toiletries and beverages in the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, 5 Philippine pesos (PHP) worth of cooking oil or an egg. Rodel earns money by buying supplies at wholesale prices and selling them retail. \r\n\r\nRodel\u2019s edge over other competitors is that he also owns a videoke machine (a karaoke with a television displaying entertaining scenery and song lyrics) alongside his store. Filipinos never miss an opportunity to sing, and a videoke session is what many Filipinos do to pass time and have fun. Rodel\u2019s store is located next to his house. His regular customers are his neighbors and the local community.  He earns a minimum of 200 PHP in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help him continue the operation of his business, Rodel is requesting a 18,000 PHP loan.

was born with a talent; he is a great painter and artist. Ever since he was young Wilmer developed this talent, and was famous for it while attending school. Now at 59 years old, Wilmer continues with the art that has become an integral part of his life, and for which he's well known. Some time ago, Wilmer offered to paint family portraits, which he turned into a means of earning money. He also has a small store in his home that earns supplemental income. In his paintings, Wilmer applies a new technique, adding chrome to make the portrait appear shiny like a photograh. Wilmer consideres this his profession and his happy to do it. With age, Wilmer's work has decreased, as he can no longer paint as rapidly as when he was young. Because of this, he ias asking for a loan of 1300 soles to buy materials for his art works and merchandise for his store. Give a hand to Wilmer so that he can continue to follow his passion.\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Spanish by Sarah Bishop, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\nWilmer naci\u00f3 con un gran talento, es un gran artista del dibujo y la pintura, desde muy peque\u00f1o desarroll\u00f3 ese gran talento, que fue reconocido en su \u00e9poca escolar.

Seidy\" group is made up of Martha Janet who is 48 years old and her friend del Carmen Hern\u00e1ndez who is 40 years old.  Martha is married and has four children: a 30-year-old self-employed son; a 26-year-old self-employed daughter; a 23-year-old self-employed son; and a 17-year-old daughter in her first year of high school.  Her friend Inez is married and also has four children: a 20-year-old son in his second year of studying for a degree; a 16-year-old son in his fourth year of high school; a 13-year-old son in his second year of high school; and a 7-year-old son in Grade 3.  Inez's husband is a mechanic, while Martha's husband is a radio technician.  Their goals are similar: Martha mentions improving her standard of living, and Inez wants to improve her families' living conditions.  Both women are fighters who want to give their families a good start in life.  Martha wants to have her own establishment and increase her inventory so that she can offer her customers a greater variety of products than what she now has.  Inez want to open a diner with better conditions and make her customers comfortable so that she can attract more clients.\r\n\r\nThe women have different businesses: Inez has been preparing and selling food for 12 years from the small market of Santa Ana while Martha has been a street vendor for 20 years.  Inez started her business with her own money as she had in mind to establish herself in the market as this was the only way to get customers as she had to raise her children and so they would not lack for any necessities.  Thus, she decided to prepare and sell food.  Initially she sold a limited number of dishes such as rice, beans, eggs but with time she has been able to include dishes such as chicken, shredded beef and so on.  Martha is a street vendor; she opened her business on her own as she enjoys working and thought of selling clothes in this manner.  Initially she wanted to establish a set business locale but because the taxes were very high she decided it would be preferable to be a street vendor.  She began with only a few goods, such as underwear, blouses and suits for children.  She needs to increase her inventory and because of this she is joining with her friend in requesting this loan which will help them both in their businesse.  Inez will use this loan as working capital to buy staple foodstuffs, vegetables, meat and soft drinks to offer her clients and Martha will buy merchandise such as clothes, sandals, cosmetics from Managua as these items will be less expensive for her to buy there.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Laure Kwon, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":263551,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"working capital","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Leon","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.435556 -86.879444","type":"point"}},"partner_id":96,"posted_date":"2009-01-30T01:10:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Inez Del Carmen ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Martha Jeanet","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":11000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":1375},{"due_date":"2009-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":1375},{"due_date":"2009-04-29T07:00:00Z","amount":1375},{"due_date":"2009-05-29T07:00:00Z","amount":1375},{"due_date":"2009-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":1375},{"due_date":"2009-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":1375},{"due_date":"2009-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1375},{"due_date":"2009-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":1375}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":68.75,"local_amount":1375,"processed_date":"2009-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T08:42:28Z","rounded_local_amount":1382.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20400026},{"amount":73.31,"local_amount":1466.13,"processed_date":"2009-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T18:37:35Z","rounded_local_amount":1473.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27092024},{"amount":64.19,"local_amount":1283.87,"processed_date":"2009-04-29T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T16:41:11Z","rounded_local_amount":1290.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35985407},{"amount":68.75,"local_amount":1375,"processed_date":"2009-05-29T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T23:11:33Z","rounded_local_amount":1382.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44446022},{"amount":88.52,"local_amount":1770.31,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T20:41:54Z","rounded_local_amount":1779.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52956661},{"amount":48.98,"local_amount":979.69,"processed_date":"2009-07-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T13:59:28Z","rounded_local_amount":984.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63174084},{"amount":68.75,"local_amount":1375,"processed_date":"2009-08-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T15:31:36Z","rounded_local_amount":1382.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73599703},{"amount":68.75,"local_amount":1375,"processed_date":"2009-09-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T17:58:41Z","rounded_local_amount":1382.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87035595}],"funded_date":"2009-01-30T07:24:05Z","paid_date":"2009-10-15T17:58:41Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"L K","image":355766}},{"id":90681,"name":"Nely","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Nely tiene 43 a\u00f1os, vive en su propia casa con sus  4 hijos.

All of the members of the group have sold clothes as street vendors for many years.\r\n\r\nDo\u00f1a Mar\u00eda Felix has been the group\u2019s coordinator for years.  She has known the turns her business takes.  She has seen how each loan has led to having a bigger inventory.  She is a mother who raised her children by herself.  She taught them how to work.  For many years she has been selling fruits and vegetables.  She buys them in the Masaya market, and she sells them for a better price in the Oriental market.  Everything that she has achieved motivates her to keep working and doing well with Admin.  She lets her group know this.  She is in charge of going and leaving the installment to be sure of its punctuality.\r\n\r\nSabina de los Angeles P. sells tamales and corn, etc.  She makes them in her house.  Very early the following day she sells them in the Oriental market.  She has done this for over ten years.  She has one young son who works.  Her son and her husband help her with the household expenses.  She dreams of improving a part of her house that needs it.\r\n\r\nAna Mar\u00eda R. is a very hard working woman who sells clothes.  She has one son who lives with her.  With the income from her work, she raised him without help from anyone.  It is clear to her that a loan is based on trust, and she must be punctual with her payment.  She sells clothes and cosmetics; this helps her receive more income.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva

To make a living, Gina owns and operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising livestock. The main source of income for the business comes from raising pigs for fattening and sale. Gina has been engaged in her business for over ten years and earns approximately 3,500 PHP whenever she sells an animal she has raised.\r\n<br>In 2010, Gina joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. She is requesting a loan of 5,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase livestock feed and other supplies. This loan will be her first from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated to improve and expand her business. \r\n<p>\r\n<b>About ASKI<\/b><br>\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines.

But a certain enterprising 48-year-old lady, who goes by the name of Joyce, has notched it. She operates in Mpigi. Longevity is not something most people talk about when they are discussing this kind of business. Most people involved in this business face stiff competition from local textile industries and the secondhand clothing markets. Most of the clothes they sew may not even be bought, if the price is not that pocket favorable. Most people would rather make do with secondhand clothing. This, however, was not a factor that could dampen Joyce's spirits 30 years ago, when she sought to earn her keep and obtain a footing in this business.\r\n\r\nShe has, by and large, had a chequered experience running this business. At the beginning, she was mostly sewing school uniforms for schools. With time, she diversified and starting sewing all sorts of clothes to sell. With orders from schools increasing, and her other clothes (mostly lady's clothes) selling favorably in her shop, Joyce knew that, with determination, she could make headway. The new lease on life in her business was translating into better sales profits. Given her nature, however, she could not rest on her laurels. This is one attribute which has kept her business afloat. Most of her friends say she is never complacent.\r\n\r\nWeekly, her business sales revenue totals up to 60,000 Ugandan shillings. This is modest by her standards but she remains upbeat. The economic status quo in the country as of now is adverse and she knows most people are facing it tough. Once the situation improves, she envisages better conditions for her business. For Joyce's group, this is their second loan cycle. Joyce says she is requesting this Kiva loan money to purchase more clothes-making textile materials. With this, she reckons she will be able to make more clothes and school uniforms to sell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2525,"image":{"id":813659,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Tailoring","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to purchase more clothes-making textile materials.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Mpigi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.083333 32","type":"point"}},"partner_id":84,"posted_date":"2011-07-17T19:50:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2525,"lender_count":75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Joyce","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elizabeth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Specioza","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rose","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Amina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Annet","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Edrisa","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Amina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Teopista","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eron","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mastulla","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-07-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":6500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":2525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1625000},{"due_date":"2011-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1625000},{"due_date":"2011-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1625000},{"due_date":"2011-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":1625000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":631.25},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":631.25},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":631.25},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":631.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":631.25,"local_amount":1625000,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-16T08:24:32Z","rounded_local_amount":1631782.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227248983},{"amount":1262.5,"local_amount":3250000,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-01T09:36:46Z","rounded_local_amount":3263564.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238868552},{"amount":631.25,"local_amount":1625000,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-06T09:22:40Z","rounded_local_amount":1631782.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244648386}],"funded_date":"2011-07-18T00:21:39Z","paid_date":"2012-01-06T09:22:40Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Laurie Russell","image":1324922}},{"id":320986,"name":"Maria Vilma","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Mar\u00eda, vive con su esposo y sus cuatro hijos de 16, 13, 8 y 4 a\u00f1os de edad, todos son dependientes, ella se dedica a atender un chalet desde hace dos a\u00f1os en la escuela de la comunidad, ofreciendo a los estudiantes y maestros boquitas, galletas, dulces, jugos, gaseosas, su horario de venta es de 7:00am a 5:00pm.\nActualmente solicita un pr\u00e9stamo para comprar mercader\u00eda, con la intenci\u00f3n de fortalecer los productos que ofrecen por ejemplo: galletas, jugos, gaseosa, boquitas y m\u00e1s.

She is a single parent to a high school student. She manages her household while operating her business. She works hard to meet her family\u2019s daily needs and expenses.\r\n\r\nFlora operates a food stall. In the Philippines, the whole working community and most of the families only eat home-cooked meals during evenings where all of the family members are at home to take part in the meal. This is not only a usual family tradition, but also a matter of convenience and frugal living. It is considered a waste of money and time to spend cooking gas and food for one to two persons, when buying cooked rice and other foods cost less than raw food. \r\n\r\nFlora also retails electronic cell phone loads (prepaid cell phone credits) and operates a small variety store. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 1,200 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nShe is requesting a loan of PHP 15, 000 that will help her continue her business.  She will be using the loan to buy raw meat, vegetables, and other products that will help her to meet the demands of her numerous customers. Her profits will definitely help her to sustain her family\u2019s daily needs and her child\u2019s educational expenses.  \r\n\r\nFlora dreams that her business will continue to grow. She wants her child to finish studies and be able to have a comfortable life someday. She never fails to attend the fellowship* every week, as it helps her to be stronger and closer to God with all the Bible studies being conducted. \r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay Micro Finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":900832,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

small-scale relief and rehabilitation project in 1972 to help the country overcome the devastation and trauma of the liberation war and focused on resettling refugees returning from India. Today, BRAC has emerged as an independent, virtually self-financed paradigm in sustainable human development. It is one of the largest Southern development organizations employing over 100,000 people, 61% of which are women, and working with the twin objectives of poverty alleviation and empowerment of the poor. Diagnosing poverty in human terms and recognizing its multifaceted nature, BRAC approaches poverty alleviation with a holistic approach.\r\n<br><br>The successes of BRAC in the international development arena have stimulated a series of discussions, both with African delegations, who have visited BRAC programs, and with donors who work in Asia and Africa. Both the African countries and the donors have encouraged BRAC to join the development campaign in Africa to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and more recently to join the campaign of \u201cending poverty\u201d, which is an area where Africa represents the greatest global challenge.\r\n<br><br> In Uganda, BRAC registered as a Non Government Organization (NGO) in January 2006 to undertake programs in Education, Health, Water & Sanitation, Agriculture & Livestock and Microfinance. The Microfinance and Education are the pioneer programs launched in Uganda and, as of July 2007, had served 21,273 borrowers and enrolled 1,155 adolescents in its education

The official name of this borrowing group is Nila I. Group.\r\n\r\nNila is married and has seven school-aged children. To make a living, Nila plants and harvests rice for sale. Nila has been engaged in her business for over 6 years and earns approximately 5,000 PHP a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2005, Nila joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Nila has successfully repaid a previous loan of 8000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional seeds, seedlings and young crops to raise. Nila is requesting a new loan of 11000 PHP which will be used to purchase fertilizers such as manure. This loan will be the 9th loan taken out by Nila from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement the family's income. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

All of whom are still going to school and need her support.\r\n\r\nCurrently, Lorenda is busy with the buying and selling of bamboo craft and charcoal to earn the means of daily living. When she received a small amount of capital from ASHI, she managed to put it all into her business. For her, business is an important factor, and she does not want to be a problem for her group mates with the weekly loan obligations.\r\n\r\nShe applied for a new loan amounting PHP 20,000.00 to have additional working capital for her business. Specifically, the loan fund will be use to purchase inventory of bamboo crafts and charcoal to sell.\r\n\r\nLorenda is a very good member of ASHI. She performs well in her business. When she has enough capital, she increases her business in order to gain more income. She hopes that through her loans availed in the ASHI partnership with KIVA; someday she will be able to save money as she is getting older. Along with the business success she is dreaming about, is the hope to see the graduation of her children at college and to see them find stable jobs.

His first child is 10 years old, the next is two years old, and the third is one years old. Jean Pierre is a businessman. His wife is jobless. Jean Pierre owns a business selling foodstuffs such as beans, rice and so on. These products are profitable, which is the reason he has chosen this kind of business.

For them the sensational phenomenon of dawn is linked to the hopes and expectations that each one of them has to arrive at a new day and just like interest is renewed so is the grace of living one more day in humans.  This is how the members explain the meaning of the name.  It is composed of 10 women and one man.  All are from San Miguel Tlacamama located 25 minutes from Pinotepa Nacional, Oaxaca.  It is known for the cheeses made in the area that are highly appreciated by locals.  Most of the people are associated with cheese making and also farm work.  The group meets in one of the member\u2019s homes where cheese is made daily.  The group representative is Minerva Irma E. Mart\u00ednez but in this case we will emphasize another group member\r\n\r\nMartha L. A., 34, is a hardworking housewife.  She is the daughter of humble field workers and is married to Javier, 35.  She is the mother of four children: Ana Laura, 16, Marisol, 15, Honorio, 11 and Gustavo, 3.  Only two of them go to school because the oldest was unable to go to school this year due to lack of resources; she helps her mother in the small business they have.\r\n\r\nMartha has been selling low-cost meals for over two years.  This activity has become her source of income.  Profits are directed primarily to provide continuity to the business, to repay her loan and to pay for her children\u2019s educational expenses.  It is also a way to help her husband because his salary as an employee is insufficient to cover the needs of four children and themselves.  This is why she decided to go into this business which, although it is close to home, still implies much work and dedication because her meals stand out due to their special savory touches.  We can find her daily at her business cooking up soups, mole and adobo and in the evenings, regional snacks like sopes, tacos and tostadas.\r\n\r\nMartha joined the group in order to obtain credit to invest in her business.  With money she was lent she bought some ingredients like: assorted chilies, tomatoes, onions, vegetables, fruits, leafy vegetables and grains like beans, rice, corn to make tortillas, oil, salt, sugar and canned goods.  To date everything in her business is running very well and she expects tourists and people on vacation to come through town during the next vacation period.\r\n\r\nShe hopes that her daughter will be able to restart her schooling next term and that the business continues to grow; that her sales don\u2019t drop so that she can continue to guarantee a good living condition for her family.  She\u2019d like to have a restaurant where she does not have to pay rent that would mean a solid support for her family.\r\n\r\nWhat Martha can add now is that thanks to the collaboration from all the good and noble people she has been able to improve the living conditions of herself and her children.  She thanks the people who gather together to do good for others.  She sends greetings to everyone that supports Kiva and Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad and asks God to keep them.\r\n\r\nFollowing is a list of the names and activities of all the members of the \u201cLa Aurora\u201d group:\r\n\r\nFrancisca V\u00e1zquez. \u2013 Fast food sales\r\n\r\nMaria Guadalupe E.

The previous loans of 3,500 and 5,000 meticais were used to get a driver\u2019s license and those for 15,000 and 20,000 meticais were for construction work on his house.  He is confident that he will repay the loan before the set time and request another to build a fence.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":925,"image":{"id":813741,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing

If one does not end up farming, they will end up engaging in the other popular economic activities like raising goats and cattle \r\n\r\nA 35-year-old father of four, Patrick says for his case, he set forth in this business four years ago in Rukungiri.  Not so long, one may say, but he says he is already enjoying the experience of engaging in this business and he is already seeing better days on the horizon for his business. He has been basking in the glow of good business, principally after selling most of the crops he grows like bananas and cassava. The good spells he has enjoyed however, do not mean he has not bore witness to adversity. He says during some particular dry seasons, his business suffers bad harvests and consequently, he is not able to sell most of his harvests at good competitive market prices. This, at length, adversely affects his financial standing. Monthly, this business generates sales revenue to the tune of Ugandan shillings 150,000 and he says with this Kiva loan he is going to purchase hoes, pangas and high-grade manure to apply on his

Over time, she has built a cowshed.  However, it is now very necessary for her to improve the infrastructure of the cowshed, because she is coming up to the winter season, and this poses many difficulties if she is to keep the cowshed clean.  It is for this reason that she decided to look for financing options that will allow her to put her plans into practice, and so she decided to work with MFP as she saw it was a good option with repayments that were within her reach.  \r\n\r\nWith the money that she is receiving, she will buy sand and bags of cement.

Today, BRAC has emerged as an independent, virtually self-financed paradigm in sustainable human development. It is one of the largest Southern development organizations employing over 100,000 people, 61% of which are women, and working with the twin objectives of poverty alleviation and empowerment of the poor. Diagnosing poverty in human terms and recognizing its multifaceted nature, BRAC approaches poverty alleviation with a holistic approach.\r\n<br><br>The successes of BRAC in the international development arena have stimulated a series of discussions, both with African delegations, who have visited BRAC programs, and with donors who work in Asia and Africa. Both the African countries and the donors have encouraged BRAC to join the development campaign in Africa to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and more recently to join the campaign of \u201cending poverty\u201d, which is an area where Africa represents the greatest global challenge.\r\n<br><br> In Uganda, BRAC registered as a Non Government Organization (NGO) in January 2006 to undertake programs in Education, Health, Water & Sanitation, Agriculture & Livestock and Microfinance. The Microfinance and Education are the pioneer programs launched in Uganda and, as of July 2007, had served 21,273 borrowers and enrolled 1,155 adolescents in its education

Other members work in public transportation, welding, or as employees in public companies. The group members know how to get ahead in business so that they can give their families their daily bread.

That\u2019s Ma. Elena H., who, despite her physical imperfection, tries to help her husband and family improve their living conditions. She is 49 years old, married to Rogelio, who works as a sugarcane supervisor. She has two children aged 22 and 28 years old. The family lives in Hacienda Cosolacion, Silay City, Negros Occidental.\r\n\r\nTo help her family earn additional income, Ma. Elena invested in a pig fattening Business, which she managed with the help of her children. Because she wants to add more piglets to her business, she decided to join NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1998 to access more capital. The loans that she received since then have been used to buy additional piglets, feed, and vitamins for her pigs. Her loans helped to sustain her business and has enabled her to earn PHP 10,000 every time she sells her pigs, which takes 3-4 months to raise. She uses the income to support her children's needs and their household expenses. She is very happy that despite her situation she could earn an income and help her family.\r\n\r\nHer previous loan of PHP 8,000 was utilized for her pig fattening business and the amount was fully paid on time without delay. Now she is borrowing PHP 9,000 for her 15th cycle loan to use to buy feed and vitamins for her pigs. Any profits will be used to defray family expenses.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress out of earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":431016,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To purchase adiitional feed and vitamins.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Silay, Negros Occidental","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":145,"posted_date":"2009-11-25T22:50:14Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":200,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ma.

barrio ubicado en la sierra central peruana.\n\nDesde muy peque\u00f1o se ha dedicado a la agricultura, en la actualidad trabaja junto a sus padres en la siembra papa, alverja y habas. El trabajo de campo es pesado, ya que requiere de mucha  paciencia y dedicaci\u00f3n en el cuidado de cada una de las  plantas para que no les caiga plaga y lleguen bien hasta la cosecha.  Seg\u00fan sus palabras: \u201cen la agricultura se gana o se pierde, pero si se cuida bien el cultivo se llega a tener una buena producci\u00f3n\u201d. A Hernando le gusta mucho su trabajo, porque las ganancias de lo vendido le permiten vivir c\u00f3modamente. Lo que no le gusta es que muchas veces el precio de la papa baja, se compensa con la venta de las alverja y habas.\nY como es un joven muy emprendedor piensa en el futuro y para m\u00e1s adelante tiene planeado sembrar en mayor cantidad, sobretodo la alverja, ya que su precio se mantiene estable en el mercado nacional.\n\nEste es el tercer pr\u00e9stamo que tiene con MFP y est\u00e1 muy agradecido con todas las personas que hicieron posible el dinero que le permitir\u00e1 continuar trabajando. Adem\u00e1s est\u00e1 muy satisfecho con el trabajo que viene realizando su grupo comunal porque todos los integrantes son muy organizados y realizan mensualmente actividades que les permiten juntar para sus ahorros. \n\nHernando tiene pensado invertir el dinero solicitado en la compra de fertilizantes para asegurar sus plantaciones, tambi\u00e9n adquirir\u00e1 semilla de papa, alverja y habas para aumentar su producci\u00f3n.","en":"Hernando is 24 years old and lives in his own house together with his parents and siblings in a neighborhood located in the central Peruvian mountains.\r\n<p>\r\nSince he was very young he has been a farmer, presently he works with his parents planting potato, pea, and bean. Farming is hard work as it requires much patience and dedication with the care of each of the plants not to be affected by plague and reach harvest in good condition. According to his words: \"in farming you win or you lose, but if you care properly for your crop you will get a good production\". Hernando likes his job because the profit from his sales allows him to live comfortably. What he does not like is that many times the price of potato is low, but the sale of pea and bean makes up for the loss. \r\n<p>\r\nAnd as he is a very entrepreneurial young man he thinks about the future and it is his plan to plant even more, especially pea as the price is stable on the national market.\r\n<p>\r\nThis is his third loan with MFP and he is very grateful to all the people who made the money possible for him to continue his work. He is also very satisfied with the work done with his community group as all the members are very organized and work on a monthly basis to gather money for their savings.\r\n<p>\r\nHernando plans to invest the requested money in buying fertilizers to assure his crops.

S.] did not work and studied architecture on a casual basis.  It was then that he manufactured his first t-shirts and has been sewing garments ever since.   He started with a single sewing machine and gradually increased his number, as his sales increased, so that he could increase his efficiency and the quality of his products.  He now has 12 machines.\r\n\r\nAnd so began Jairo J. S.'s business.  He now sews alongside his wife, who was once a secretary, but now works exclusively in this business.  She does the measuring and hiring, and he primarily does the design work, cutting, printing, and sales.  His customers include prominent schools in the city of Barranquilla, for whom he makes sweaters, sweatshirts; and everything having to do with sports, which is his business' specialty.\r\n\r\nJairo, along with his wife's support, has managed to move his family ahead.  His family includes his three children, ages 15, 17, and 21.  He hopes that he will one day be able to see them all have professional careers.\r\n\r\nHe is requesting a loan in the amount of 1.355.500 COP ($725), through Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo because his son is going to begin studying to become a lawyer.  This will be his sixth loan though this organization and he feels that things have gone well, because he has managed to provide his children with a primary education.\r\n\r\nJairo tells us that the global economy has been a great setback to him, especially because of the Chinese merchandise that has entered the market.  Their t-shirts are very inexpensive, but the ones he and his family manufacture are of better quality.  Aside from Jario, his wife, and daughters, his mother and several employees also work in production.  He is constantly looking for strategies to keep all of his machines producing, creating work, earning money, and providing for his family's (and his own) well being.\r\n\r\nJario is a member of a loving family and is also a good artist who proudly displays his paintings on the walls of his home. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Hugo Reyes, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":567967,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Primary\/secondary school costs","sector":"Education","themes":null,"use":"Education","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2010-07-19T04:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":725,"lender_count":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jairo Enrique","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-07-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1355500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":216685},{"due_date":"2010-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":220297},{"due_date":"2010-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":223968},{"due_date":"2010-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":227701},{"due_date":"2010-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":231496},{"due_date":"2011-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":235353}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":115.9},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":117.82},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":119.79},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":121.79},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":123.82},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125.88}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":115.9,"local_amount":216685,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:17:11Z","rounded_local_amount":217061.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166850366},{"amount":117.82,"local_amount":220297,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:08:10Z","rounded_local_amount":220679.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172117120},{"amount":119.79,"local_amount":223968,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T14:01:15Z","rounded_local_amount":224356.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177410990},{"amount":121.79,"local_amount":227701,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T14:08:40Z","rounded_local_amount":228096.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182550643},{"amount":123.82,"local_amount":231496,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T13:14:15Z","rounded_local_amount":231897.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188688248},{"amount":125.88,"local_amount":235353,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-18T09:56:42Z","rounded_local_amount":235761.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191427480}],"funded_date":"2010-07-19T08:12:31Z","paid_date":"2011-02-18T09:56:42Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Hugo E.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from buying and selling daily use products such as shampoo, soap, canned goods, beverages, snack foods and toothpaste in the local community. She also sells green bananas. Anastacia has been engaged in her business for over 5 years and earns approximately 10,000 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2007, Anastacia joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Anastacia has successfully repaid a previous loan of 11,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional inventory and working capital. Anastacia is requesting a new loan of 15,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell like snack foods and canned goods. This loan will be the 4th loan taken out by Anastacia from HSPFI.

She is 41 years old. Jovelyn is married and has five school-aged children. To make a living, Jovelyn owns & operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising crops. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from planting and harvesting bananas for sale. Jovelyn has been engaged in her business for over one year and earns approximately 2000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2011, Jovelyn joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Jovelyn is requesting a loan of 5000 PHP which will be used to purchase fertilizers such as manure. This will be the first loan taken out by Jovelyn from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three unit offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

After finishing high school in 1983 Islatkan attended Osh Pedagogical Institute, but unfortunately after the first semester she was kidnapped for marriage (the ancient tradition of stealing girls for brides has lasted a long time but currently occurs rarely and is punishable by law). Since she had been married she had to quit college and became a house wife. In 1984 Islatkan gave birth to her daughter and in 1986 she divorced her husband and started to work as a nurse in the Zhalal-Abad hospital. In 1987 Islatkan found happiness in a second marriage and gave birth to a son and a daughter. Unfortunately in 2004 she divorced again and moved with her children to the city of Karabalt. To feed her family Islatkan opened a sewing business and has been making mattresses and pillows which she sells wholesale on the market. Because of her hard work and determination Islatkan's business has flourished in 2008 and she was able to buy an apartment in the Kalininskoe village. After her move Islatkan has married off all of her children, who now live with their own families.\r\n\r\nThe energetic Islatkan is still running her sewing business and takes in orders that yield 12,500 som (KGS) in monthly profits. To grow her business further she has turned to \"Bai-Tushum and partners\" for a loan of 70,000 som (KGS). She is planning to use the money to purchase a new sewing machine and a serger\/overlock machine. She is also planning to hire two seamstresses for her business which will allow her to take in more orders. In the future Islatkan dreams of opening a small sewing factory.\r\n

In the long term, she wants to be able to finish making improvements to her home and to be able to contribute to the balanced diet of the children at the dining-room so that they are healthy and strong. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Joanna Silverman, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":215189,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":null,"use":"Expansion of a room","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Managua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.150833 -86.268333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":98,"posted_date":"2008-10-26T23:40:16Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":175,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Luisa Marina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-11-10T02:18:38Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2009-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2009-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2009-03-09T07:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2009-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2009-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2009-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2009-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2009-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":333.36}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":19.44},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":19.44},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":19.44},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":19.44},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.44},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.44},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.44},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.44},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.48}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":19.44,"local_amount":333.33,"processed_date":"2008-12-09T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-15T09:56:35Z","rounded_local_amount":384.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9893367},{"amount":19.44,"local_amount":333.33,"processed_date":"2009-01-09T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T09:16:54Z","rounded_local_amount":384.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14816444},{"amount":19.44,"local_amount":333.33,"processed_date":"2009-02-09T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-15T08:19:02Z","rounded_local_amount":384.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20351151},{"amount":19.44,"local_amount":333.33,"processed_date":"2009-03-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T09:04:20Z","rounded_local_amount":384.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27038469},{"amount":19.44,"local_amount":333.33,"processed_date":"2009-04-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T09:39:46Z","rounded_local_amount":384.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35928772},{"amount":19.44,"local_amount":333.33,"processed_date":"2009-05-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T20:19:42Z","rounded_local_amount":384.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44383698},{"amount":19.44,"local_amount":333.33,"processed_date":"2009-06-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T16:24:29Z","rounded_local_amount":384.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52890186},{"amount":19.44,"local_amount":333.33,"processed_date":"2009-07-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T09:33:07Z","rounded_local_amount":384.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63111512},{"amount":19.48,"local_amount":333.36,"processed_date":"2009-08-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T09:41:00Z","rounded_local_amount":384.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73532952}],"funded_date":"2008-10-27T01:18:38Z","paid_date":"2009-09-15T09:41:00Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Joanna Silverman","image":null}},{"id":74345,"name":"Patricia Evelyn","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La Sra.

He studied until the 11th grade.  He is married and the father of 3 children:  the first is 8 years old, the second is 5, and the youngest is a new born of only 2 weeks.  The two oldest kids are students.\r\n\r\nHilario left V. for Beira with his parents who were in the miltary when he was only 2 years old.  He lived there for 15 years and was able to complete the 6th grade.  His father was transferred to work as a policeman in Namaacha, a town on the border of Swaziland, and he came with his family.  Arriving in Namaacha he was able to continue with his schooling and completed the 11th grade.  Since the cost of living was increasing every day Hilario borrowed money from his uncle and began his own business selling shoes in the informal market of Namaacha (known as Shoprite) that operates 2 times per week.\r\n\r\nHe was able to construct his own home.  Years later he was contracted to work in the Moseg as security of TDM in the same district.  Because of this he had to interrupt his business since his work schedule conflicted with the market days, and that caused him to go bankrupt.\r\n\r\nToday he is a worker for Moseg, and he earns monthly salary of 1,800MT working in shifts, one period of 24 hours per day 3 times per week.  He is unable to save any money because he earns so little.  In 2007 he found out about Hluvuku as soon as they opened a branch in Namaacha, and he had the opportunity to obtain a loan for 7,000MT.\r\n\r\nThis is Hilario's second loan through Hluvuku and his first with Kiva.  The first loan of 7,000MT was used to purchase shoes that he would resell at the informal market before work, and he is asking for this second loan of 10,000MT to purhase construction materials.  He is confident that he can repay this loan before its term so he can request another loan in order to construct a stand in his home to sell various staple products.\r\n\r\n<br

Comfort has been selling yams and bags of gari for almost eight years to support her family. She started this business with her mother when she was a young girl.

","en":"\r\n\r\n\tThis group is located in Tenextepango, A. municipality, state of Morelos. It\u2019s made of 4 members who are Mrs. Silvia N. C., whose works making hand-embroidered napkins and tablecloths, Mrs. Armanda R. A., who has a mechanic shop, and Mrs. Carmela A. V., who works selling cosmetics by catalog. Currently, they are in their third cycle. This group was formed on the recommendation from a member of another group.\r\n\r\n\tAt this time, we would like to call your attention to Mrs. Armanda R. A.. She is now 34 years old. Her family consists of her husband, her 8-year-old son, and she is presently 4 months pregnant. Mrs. Armanda has been part of this group since the first cycle. Currently, she has a loan of $5000, which she invested in valves, patches and calibrators, since her business is a mechanic shop, \u201cDiaz,\u201d that offers service in patching and sales of new and used tires.\r\n\r\nShe began her mechanic shop two and a half years ago, because she was working in a large tire shop in the city of Cuautla. Her bosses offered her a shop rental in the center of the market of Cuautla, so that she could establish her own business. When she told her husband, who was employed at the time, he agreed to open the shop, and they did. After some time, with the earnings from their first shop, they established another and, with government support, bought a tire press and balancer. Their second business was born, located in Tenextepango and tended by the brother-in-law of Mrs. Armanda, who has experience in two other mechanic shops. However, he says with pride that the customers prefer the service at this shop for its speed and efficiency, due to the fact that they use machines to do what other businesses do by hand, which takes more time. \r\n\r\nHer plans are to continue investing in their businesses, to get the investment for utilities needed for their home (floor, ironwork and exterior walls). The motivation that drives them is the desire to give their children a good home.\r\n\r\nIn the long-term, they want to offer alignment, however to give this service would require approximately $100,000 in capital. At this moment, they do not want to grossly indebt themselves with a loan this large. So they keep working until this loan is more realistic and give thanks for the trust that they have been offered through these loans. They say that they have served them well. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Rebecca Towle, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1125,"image":{"id":390144,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Vehicle Repairs","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"To purchase valves, patches and calibrators","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"TENEXTEPANGO, CD AYALA, MORELOS","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:27Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1125,"lender_count":41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Carmela ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Silvia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Armanda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nancy Adriana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-09-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":15000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":1125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":1363.05},{"due_date":"2009-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1391.81},{"due_date":"2009-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1421.17},{"due_date":"2009-11-02T08:00:00Z","amount":1451.15},{"due_date":"2009-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":1481.76},{"due_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":1513.02},{"due_date":"2009-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":1544.94},{"due_date":"2009-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":1577.53},{"due_date":"2010-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":1610.81},{"due_date":"2010-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":1644.76}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":102.23},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":104.38},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":106.59},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":108.84},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":111.13},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":113.48},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":115.87},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":118.31},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":120.81},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":123.36}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":206.61,"local_amount":2754.86,"processed_date":"2009-10-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T22:10:35Z","rounded_local_amount":2795.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96952647},{"amount":106.59,"local_amount":1421.17,"processed_date":"2009-10-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T22:12:45Z","rounded_local_amount":1442.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96952648},{"amount":108.84,"local_amount":1451.15,"processed_date":"2009-11-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T12:41:18Z","rounded_local_amount":1472.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103794803},{"amount":111.13,"local_amount":1481.76,"processed_date":"2009-11-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T12:41:34Z","rounded_local_amount":1503.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103794804},{"amount":113.48,"local_amount":1513.02,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T12:41:46Z","rounded_local_amount":1535.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103794805},{"amount":115.87,"local_amount":1544.94,"processed_date":"2009-12-14T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T13:57:16Z","rounded_local_amount":1567.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110685962},{"amount":118.31,"local_amount":1577.53,"processed_date":"2009-12-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T13:57:25Z","rounded_local_amount":1600.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110685963},{"amount":120.81,"local_amount":1610.81,"processed_date":"2010-01-11T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:38:48Z","rounded_local_amount":1634.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118080306},{"amount":123.36,"local_amount":1644.76,"processed_date":"2010-01-25T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:38:50Z","rounded_local_amount":1668.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118080307}],"funded_date":"2009-10-02T13:58:38Z","paid_date":"2010-02-15T11:38:50Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Rebecca Towle","image":225476}},{"id":144063,"name":"Mom","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mom T., 45, is a widow who lives with one of her children in the Takeo province.

She has been in this business since the early 1990s. She started it after the collapse of the Soviet Union, when most government agricultural land was privatized. At the present time, her seasonal income from farming exceeds $1500 USD. Habibahon usually spends all her income in covering family expenses. Her business earnings have meant that her family could marry both children, build a house for her son, and increase the number of livestock. In the near future, Habibahon is planning to open a food market near her house. This is her first loan from Kiva partner, Mol Bulak Finance, and it will be used to buy potato seeds and 300 kilos of mineral fertilizers.\r\n<br>Hojiumar, 49, is a father of two married children. He is a farmer, and will use his loan to buy potato seeds and fertilizers. Hojiumar has a dream of building a pharmacy and barber shop in the village center because the local population has to go to the district center to buy drugs.  \r\n<br>Adinahon, 41, is also a farmer. Her family has a total of 0.47 hectare of land. She cultivates potatoes and wheat there. She is requesting a loan to prepare for the spring sowing by plowing and buying potato seeds. Adinahon is married with two children. Her husband works in a cotton plant, and all her family members take an active role in the family business. \r\n<br>Gaznahan is 47 years old. She is a widow with four children, the eldest two of whom are married. The other two children are students. Gaznahan will use her loan to buy 500 kilos of potato seeds and 100 kilos of fertilizer. In the future, Gaznahan hopes that she will be able to build a house for her second son. For her, the most important thing is the happiness of her children. \r\n<p>\r\n<b>About Mol Bulak Finance<\/b><br>\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance, a young and ambitious socially-focused MFI in Kyrgyzstan.
