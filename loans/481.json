It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Living in a region where raising farm animals is the main line of work, Azimjon has been selling cattle from 2004. He buys cattle from farmers who raise them, for resale at the market. Since his capital is limited, he buys only a couple of heads of cattle, and after selling them, he returns to buy more. Azimjon would like to expand his business by increasing his working capital and maximizing his profit. This is why he is requesting  a loan to buy  young cattle. \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women and uses the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets; thus they are deemed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro-leasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":237345,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To purchase more rice and cocoa in bulk","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Kyela","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-9.583333 33.85","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-12-14T08:00:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Merida B.

Houda has been doing tattoos since 2002, and has been doing eyebrows for a year. Houda requested a loan of $1000 from Al Majmoua in order to purchase tools for her tattoos. This is her fourth loan cycle and she has always paid on time. \r\n\r\nHer previous loans helped her purchase what she needed for her work, and with them she was able to meet her family\u2019s needs.

Therefore, Alis concluded that she needed to work and help with the household finances.  For three years she has been selling various crops grown by local farmers.  She later decided to sell to a distributor who comes to her house to pick up the produce.  \r\n<p>\r\nIn addition, Alis raises and sells sheep.  Her customers are livestock dealers who pass through the area.  She wants to buy some sheep to raise for later resale.  For this reason, she has requested her first loan from Edpyme Alternativa in the amount of 1000 soles.  \r\n<p>\r\nAlis is committed, hardworking, and optimistic.

The circumstances force these people to go to work as soon as they graduate from high school. The life makes these people grow up earlier and start supporting their families, whereas their peers may still enjoy their youth. However, there is an advantage to this state of affairs. Beginning to support one\u2019s family from early age makes this person mature and better prepared for life. From this point they could regard themselves even as fortunate ones. T. K. Albina, the leader of this group, is one of these fortunate youngsters, who started earning their livelihood at an early age. Albina is nineteen years old. She is single and lives with her family. She has a sister, who is two years younger than her. Albina combines two jobs. During her spare time she helps her mother, who is occupied with manufacturing traditional articles of bedding and coverlets. Her mother used to work in a sewing workshop, but because of the low salary, she decided to start her own business. Albina has applied for this loan to help her mother purchase fabric and expand their business.\r\n\r\nAlbina\u2019s partners are:\r\n\r\nAinur, 45, is single. She lives with her father. Because of her father\u2019s illness Ainur is temporarily not working, as she has to stay by her father\u2019s side and take care of him. Her brother provides them with food and medicine. Ainur needs this loan to buy a washing machine, a DVD player and a ton of coal. \r\n\r\nSvetlana, 47, is a mother of four children. Her husband works as a bus driver. Svetlana is a teacher in an elementary school. One of Svetlana\u2019s daughters goes to college and Svetlana needs a loan to pay for tuition. \r\n\r\nAlisa, 55, lives in a city of Balykchi. Alisa trades in sea\u2013buckthorn. Her husband, 65, is retired. Her youngest son, 21, works as a waiter in a caf\u00e9. At weekends he helps Alisa sell the sea\u2013buckthorn. Alisa has applied for this loan to purchase ten sheep for breeding.\r\n\r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance, a young and ambitious socially-focused MFI in Kyrgyzstan.\r\n\r\nMol Bulak Finance is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development on the basis of 3-Ps concept - People (building human capital and taking care of its customers and the society as well), Profit (to be profitable to grow further) and the Planet (taking care of the environment).

It is situated about 30 km (one hour's drive) from Kupang City. Even though this village is categorized as a remote place, the road into the village is good and has been sealed. There are 35 families who live in the village. The community in Oenif Village relies on farming as their primary income source. The most difficult challenge faced by the community is lack of water for watering their crops. They usually sell their agricultural crops in Inpres Market at Kupang City, as there is no traditional market available in the village. They take motorbike taxis to bring their agricultural crops to Inpres Market as there is no public transport from their village. It costs IDR. 20.000\/ return trip.\r\n\r\nNazaret A Group is led by a 41 year old, Obednego L.. He is married and blessed with three nice children. They are: \r\n- Remli L., 17 years old, who is in the Second Grade of Senior High School\r\n- Reliana L., 14 years old, who is in the Second Grade of Junior High School\r\n- Rismi L., 7 years old, who is in the First Grade of Elementary School\r\n\r\nObednego relies on agricultural crops and the breeding of pigs and goats. Obednego is very concerned about his children\u2019s education. For Obednego education is a priority for his children\u2019s future. Currently, Remli is studying in a Catholic School in So\u2019e - South Central Region of Timor in East Nusa Tenggara Province. It is situated about 150 km from Oenif Village, so they need a lot of money to pay his education costs. He has to send IDR 500,000 per month to pay for his son\u2019s school, living expenses and daily needs. This is one of the reasons why Obednego has to work hard at selling his crops. Fortunately, his wife is able to help him with selling their agricultural crops at the market.\r\n\r\nAs the father of 3 children, Obednego dreams of providing a better life for his family and to support his children\u2019s education through to University. The lack of capital is the main issue for him in improving his family\u2019s living standard. Moreover, he also does not have any other skills to generate further income. One day he heard from the clergyman in the village that the Kiva field partner \u2013 TLM Foundation, assists poor farmers, particularly in West Timor, by providing loans through the Cattle Fattening Program. He is very interested in joining the program as he has experience in fattening livestock and he thinks this program will have a positive impact on his family\u2019s future.   \r\n\r\nObednego discussed it with his neighbours and they are also interested in the program so they formed a group which is called Nazaret A. Obednego is requesting a loan of IDR 3,200,000 to buy a young cow to be fattened over a 12 month period. Other group members are also requesting loans to buy young cattle as they are sure this program is a good way for them to improve their families\u2019 lives. \r\n\r\nNote: Sarlota and Sara were replaced by their family members when the group picture was taken.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2825,"image":{"id":517128,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy cattle to be fattened.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Oenif","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":129,"posted_date":"2010-03-30T17:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2825,"lender_count":101,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Obednego","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sarlota","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Otniel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Melanus","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yohana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yublina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Adel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sara","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"IDR","disbursal_amount":25600000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":2825,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":25600000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2825}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":2825,"local_amount":25600000,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T12:18:13Z","rounded_local_amount":25622750,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201364948}],"funded_date":"2010-04-17T04:11:09Z","paid_date":"2011-04-15T12:18:13Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Brett & Margaret Silberg","image":null}},{"id":194408,"name":"Felix Nilton","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"FELIX TIENE 27 A\u00d1OS, ES SOLTERO Y TRABAJA EN CONSTRUCCION, ES UNA PERSONA RESPONSABLE \nQUE SE INICIO EN ESTE NEGOCIO HACE MAS DE 2 A\u00d1OS APROXIMADAMENTE.

Her business has grown quickly over the years and she has gained much experience as a businesswoman. Her earnings have enabled her to build a winter house and buy a truck, so that her husband and youngest son could operate their transportation business. Thanks to their business and endless effort, three of her four children have attended University and gotten their degrees. Now they are all married and able to take care of their families by themselves.

The members of this family are all hardworking, honest and effective people who could use the bank loans successfully and improved their quality of life and pay the loan back on time. Handsuren is requesting a 2,000,000 MNT to purchase more meat that she could sell and make more money during Tsagaan Sar, Mongolian Traditional New Year.

She participates in about 3 activities a day. She feels she has a lot more free time and wishes to occupy this time with business.

For this reason, she wants to start selling charcoal for more income. \r\n<p>\r\nShe requests a loan of 250,000 Ugandan shillings, which she will repay in 7 months. This equals a loan request of USD150.

Fish are plentiful in the waters around the city and is a staple of the local Tanzanian diet.  She is an enterprising micro-entrepreneur who is taking advantage of a local need to make monthly profits of $240. She works at the business for 12 hours a day, 7 days a week.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility.

Eloina has a dressmaking workshop located in her house, because of which she now doesn't have room to work, so she is constructing a room for her workshop. She has many years of experience in dressmaking and secure clients. The loan will be invested in the construction of her workshop.

Here is a story about one woman, which is an example of bravery and self-confidence. \r\n<br>After her marriage, Tynymkan M. never dreamed she would suffer. As the eldest child in her family, she was responsible \u2013 and that is why she did not think much about marriage. However, kidnapping is common in the country; Tynymkan was kidnapped, but she still thought about her family and her brothers and sisters. Unless her siblings married, she took care of them. She also decided to take care of herself because she was getting older. \r\n<br>Finally, Tynymkan gave birth, little knowing that her happiness would not last much longer. Her husband died the same year from a heart attack. At that moment, it seemed her life was totally destroyed. However, her child motivated her to move on. Her son became an adult and graduated from university. But life is very cruel, and on the way home, he fought with a group of scum who mutilated him forever. He is now 40 years old and an invalid.\r\n<br>The situation was unimaginable. However, Tynymkan took a loan of 15,000 KGS and bought three sheep for fattening and reselling. Now her life is not so bad, and she is requesting another loan to increase her number of cattle in order to sell them and help her child.\r\n<p>\r\nAynagul B. is 39 and married. She has five children, and her husband works as a welder for a company. Her elder daughter works in a caf\u00e9 as a waitress while the rest are still at home. Five years ago, they bought some cattle with her husband's salary and began their business. They are planning to increase their number of cattle so that they can educate their children. They want to take a loan in order to buy fodder.\r\n<p>\r\nAynur J. is 39, a widow, and has two children who both attend the local school. She is planning to apply for a job and marry successfully. She is requesting a loan for dental treatment.\r\n<p>\r\nAygul J. is 38, married, and has five children. Her husband works as a driver in a company.

She lives with her husband and two sons, ages 8 and 5, and baby daughter, age 1.  Carmen sells plastic products, such as food or water storage containers.  She also sells small chairs and different types of cosmetics.  She sells all of these products on foot, making a daily income, most of which she must spend on her family and on household expenses.  This makes it difficult for her to invest in her business and making it difficult for her to grow it.  For this reason, Carmen is requesting a loan through Integral, so that she can have the necessary funds to buy cosmetics in bulk, so that she can offer various types at various prices, allowing her to attract more customers.  Carmen works hard every day for the well-being of her family.  She would like to give only the best to her three children and ensure that they are never in need of their basic requirements.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Hugo Reyes, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":499457,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Cosmetics for resale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Osicala, departamento de Moraz\u00e1n","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":81,"posted_date":"2010-03-02T22:30:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":600,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Carmen ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-02-19T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":600,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2011-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2011-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":50}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":50,"local_amount":50,"processed_date":"2010-03-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T08:12:53Z","rounded_local_amount":50,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128899225},{"amount":50,"local_amount":50,"processed_date":"2010-04-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T09:45:43Z","rounded_local_amount":50,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136627398},{"amount":50,"local_amount":50,"processed_date":"2010-05-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T08:45:52Z","rounded_local_amount":50,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144661464},{"amount":50,"local_amount":50,"processed_date":"2010-06-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:19:12Z","rounded_local_amount":50,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151845904},{"amount":50,"local_amount":50,"processed_date":"2010-07-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T09:50:16Z","rounded_local_amount":50,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159584505},{"amount":50,"local_amount":50,"processed_date":"2010-08-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T09:35:23Z","rounded_local_amount":50,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166794935},{"amount":50,"local_amount":50,"processed_date":"2010-09-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T09:38:23Z","rounded_local_amount":50,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172064337},{"amount":50,"local_amount":50,"processed_date":"2010-10-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T12:48:40Z","rounded_local_amount":50,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177355287},{"amount":50,"local_amount":50,"processed_date":"2010-11-19T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T12:50:52Z","rounded_local_amount":50,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182489952},{"amount":50,"local_amount":50,"processed_date":"2010-12-19T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T12:16:17Z","rounded_local_amount":50,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188624740},{"amount":50,"local_amount":50,"processed_date":"2011-01-19T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T01:28:58Z","rounded_local_amount":50,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191367702},{"amount":50,"local_amount":50,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-23T08:16:21Z","rounded_local_amount":50,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":196807245}],"funded_date":"2010-03-08T18:33:33Z","paid_date":"2011-03-23T08:16:21Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Hugo E.

This is Swaibu. He is the Director of Jinja Progressive Secondary School, a mixed school in the urban area of Jinja with 2500 students. Jinja Progressive Secondary School has requested a loan to cover the cost of installing and maintaining two UV water filtration systems to provide clean drinking water for its students. The school requires two systems due to the high population; one will be installed in the dining hall and another in the boy\u2019s dormitory. This loan will be used to install the first system in the dormitory section. The school does not currently have access to consistent clean drinking water and therefore has to spend a considerable portion of its budget on firewood, which is used to boil water for the children. Installing a water filtration system will therefore save the school money in the long-term as the cost of firewood will be reduced. The loan will enable the school to purchase two UV water treatment systems with two 750 litre tanks, which will be big enough to store clean drinking water for the students every day. \n\nJinja Progressive Secondary School will repay their loan from their school fees, which they collect each term. Swaibu ultimately hopes that having access to safe drinking water will improve his student\u2019s concentration and attendance by reducing the number of children that fall sick from water-borne diseases as well as increase the number of students coming to the school.\n"}},"status":"deleted","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1727532,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Education provider","sector":"Education","themes":["Innovative Loans"],"use":"To purchase a water filtration system to provide clean drinking water for its students.

Since it is a tradition, there is always a huge demand for hamacas (swings).\r\n\r\nFrom an early age Alicio started working with his mother in the production of swings and bedspreads. They started selling their products to different craft stores, but then they realized that they could sell on their own, and that would be much more profitable.

Sabina thanks you for your support!\r\n\r\n<p>SELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Lending. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a lending microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microlending is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":216295,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Sabina would like to purchase rice, sugar, salt, cooking oil, kerosene, etc., to resell at her store.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbeya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.9 33.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-10-23T18:00:27Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sabina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-11-06T22:02:47Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2008-12-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:07:53Z","rounded_local_amount":50220,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9970719},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-01-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:12:25Z","rounded_local_amount":50220,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14886936},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-02-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:01:52Z","rounded_local_amount":50220,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20436196},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-03-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:54:09Z","rounded_local_amount":50220,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130469},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-04-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:22:47Z","rounded_local_amount":50220,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027271},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-05-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:12:33Z","rounded_local_amount":50220,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613296},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-06-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:00:47Z","rounded_local_amount":50220,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010379},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-07-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:37:36Z","rounded_local_amount":50220,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63232690},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-08-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:51:42Z","rounded_local_amount":50220,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73664506},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-09-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T02:44:44Z","rounded_local_amount":50219.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87105251}],"funded_date":"2008-10-23T21:02:47Z","paid_date":"2009-10-16T02:44:44Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jen Villareal","image":832064}},{"id":74781,"name":"Mutabar","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"G.

Moreover, they sometimes sell bedsheets and embroidered clothing made of poplin. <P>\r\n\r\nWishing to satisfy the needs of their clientele, they decided to join the micro-finance institution Soro Yiriwaso with whom they are on their 5th solidarity loan, after having reimbursed the other four loans successfully. This loan will be used to buy 5 sacks of millet (part of which will be made into fried cakes to sell), 3 sacks of dried okra, and 8 sacks of fresh onions (which will be peeled, washed, cut into small pieces, dried in a dryer, then packaged up in plastic.)<P>\r\n\r\nA good part of this processed onion will be kept until the off-season, where onions are rare in the markets.

Saiyora is married with two children. She is a private entrepreneur who works in the central city market selling women\u2019s clothing, offering a large variety of women\u2019s clothing at reasonable prices. She has been in business for thirteen years.\r\n\r\nSaiyora has benefited a lot from a year of partnering with IMON International. She now needs a loan of 4,000 Somoni to re-stock her inventory and purchase clothing wholesale for the autumn season. She believes that the sphere of market trade where she works is a promising niche and will continue to grow and develop in the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>More about Tajikistan and IMON International<\/b>\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She lives in Isfara with her family and runs her business selling blankets, kerchiefs and towels in the central market. She launched her enterprise 6 years ago. Munira has rich experience working in this business. The first time she applied to IMON International for financial assistance was 6 years ago. Ever since, her business has expanded, and she gained a reputation as an entrepreneur of integrity and great potential. \r\n\r\nMunira has consistent credit history in IMON International. We believe her positive standing and strong determination to achieve even higher goals will help her succeed and repay her loan on time. \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.<p>\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.<p>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<p>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

They live in extended traditional conjugal families in the TINGOLE village, in the FANA subprefecture, prefecture of DIO\u00cfLA (KOULIKORO region, Republic of Mali). They got to know each other through their businesses (they sell fruits and vegetables). In view of increasing their financial resources to be able to purchase more products, they joined Kiva's partner, the microfinance organization Soro Yiriwaso. They are seeking their sixth group loan. Out of the previous loans, four were for agriculture, and all previous loans were repaid without problems.\r\n<p>\r\nWith this loan, these women intend to buy 300 kg of bananas, 150 kg of eggplants, 400 kg of cabbages, and 200 kg of oranges. These products will be purchased from vegetable gardens in TINGOLE and in the surrounding villages, to be retailed for cash in FANA, to a clientele comprising both men and women.

This has led him to seek his first, 1000 new sol, loan from Edpyme Alternativa.\r\n\r\nHe is an honorable person who is held in high esteem by his neighbors.

This has been very profitable and beneficial, as it is in a strategic location where there are many customers. She most enjoys attending to her customers, and her children occasionally help her with customer service. She has been doing this for 2 years and finds that her greatest difficulty is having to spend long hours in the phone booth without being able to leave. With time, she hopes that her business will grow and offer her better income. This is her tenth loan with MFP, and she knows that she has to repay all her quotas on time; she is ready to do so, since she does not want to drag her community group down. She is very beloved in her community group because of the solidarity that she demonstrates. With the 1000 soles she is requesting she will purchase a new booth in order to be able to attend to more customers at once.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Christine Cooper, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":591852,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Call Center","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to purchase a new booth to better offer her call service","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-09-02T00:10:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Carmen ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-08-06T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":152.7},{"due_date":"2010-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":158.1},{"due_date":"2010-11-04T07:00:00Z","amount":163.68},{"due_date":"2010-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":169.45},{"due_date":"2011-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":175.43},{"due_date":"2011-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":180.64}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.26},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.29},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":61.38},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.54},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65.79},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.74}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":57.26,"local_amount":152.7,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:25:20Z","rounded_local_amount":159.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172154561},{"amount":59.29,"local_amount":158.1,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T15:14:40Z","rounded_local_amount":165.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177449873},{"amount":61.38,"local_amount":163.68,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:00:54Z","rounded_local_amount":171.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182588575},{"amount":63.54,"local_amount":169.45,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T14:05:09Z","rounded_local_amount":177.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188725077},{"amount":65.79,"local_amount":175.43,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T04:41:54Z","rounded_local_amount":183.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191463177},{"amount":67.74,"local_amount":180.64,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T08:52:44Z","rounded_local_amount":189.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195886583}],"funded_date":"2010-09-03T13:58:59Z","paid_date":"2011-03-24T08:52:44Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Christine Cooper","image":1766620}},{"id":231329,"name":"Michael","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Michael M. is from the village of Malibacsan, Jimenez, Misamis Occidental.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go for to buy one sachet of shampoo, a Php5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling piece rate.  Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of Php200 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php 28,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n \r\nSusan dreams that her children will be able to finish their education soon. She also hopes that her business will continue to grow. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay Micro Finance loans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":700233,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

Personal vehicles are too expensive for most people to afford in Tajikistan. Transportation services such as buses and taxis like Hazratkul\u2019s provide a valuable means of getting around for many, many people. Hazratkul currently makes around $10-$20 per day, enough for him to support himself and his family. Hazratkul has requested a loan of 5000 Somoni to help him with some maintenance on his taxi.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

My children are not doing anything to bring in a living and my husband is a subsistence farmer who brings no income to the family.\u201d\r\n\r\n<p>Diana has been a member of GHAPE for three years now and has successfully repaid two loans, both of which she invested in buying and selling palm oil, pigs, and farming crops like beans, maize, cassava, corn, and potatoes.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.<P>\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.<P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The association was founded in 1993 by twenty entrepenurial women as a cooperative to increase their purchasing power and organize a tontine.  A tontine is a revolving group loan in which each member contributes a small amount to a daily fund, with a different member financed each day.  The tontine has evolved to more formal group loans through UIMCEC.  For such loans, the members are split into five-member groups, with a designated president and treasurer.  These sub-groups may be the same for many years, but often change members depending on financing needs and other considerations.  The AFDE organizes monthly member meetings and runs a cooperative for its members, allowing them to buy rice and other staples at a better price. The association's President is Ms. Mame Diarra Mar.

He lives in the Reparto Schik neighborhood with his wife and 12-year-old son, who is in elementary school. \r\n\r\nMarlon sells movies on DVD, music DVDs, videos, remote controls, cases, CD cases and whatever else his customers order from him.  He launched his business using savings from his job in construction.  This was exhausting work and often he would go for weeks without any job offers.  He started to put away some savings to set up his CD sales shop.  Gradually, he invested more and now this is his sole source of income.  \r\n\r\nAmong his challenges are power failures.  When this happens his customers are unable to sample the CDs and his sales drop because they don\u2019t trust that the CD will be in good condition.\r\n\r\nHe will use the funds to buy cell phone accessories, movies, music, controls, radio batteries, cell phone chargers and other items that will generate profits.\r\n\r\nHis plans are to make improvements to his shop because it\u2019s currently just secured with zinc metal sheeting and he fears that robbers could gain access.

is 56 years old. He lives with his partner Victoria. Together they have 2 small children who are dependent on him. Angel is divorced; unfortunately, he was divorced from his wife with whom he shared more than 20 years of marriage. The problem was that his wife was unfaithful when she was working abroad. However, life gave him another opportunity and he was able to form a new family. Angel lives in the city of Cochabamba. His main economic activity is renting his truck to a mining company. This is his only activity to support his family. \r\n\r\nThe loan will be used to repair his truck. The repair is needed in the motor, because it had problems while it was working.

She is 26 years old and married to Raymundo; they have an 8-year-old son, Ricardo, who goes to second grade.  She has been selling traditional Mexican fast food snacks and making napkins for five years.\r\n\r\nRosa (like she\u2019s better known in her community) decided to go into this business because she needed to improve her quality of life and because she did not have sufficient economic solvency for her son\u2019s education and to offer him a better future.  She will use the loan to buy more ingredients like oil, salt, rice, tomatoes, chili peppers, meat, etc. and also thread, fabric, muslin and needles to continue making her napkins.\r\n\r\nShe wants to continue investing in her business because she wants to save up to build a locale to open a small restaurant because that way her production will be larger and she\u2019ll have more variety of dishes to increase sales and profits to continue supporting her son\u2019s education so that in future he will be able to complete a good professional career.\r\n\r\nShe says that she\u2019s very grateful to Kiva lenders and to FRAC because thanks to them she\u2019s getting ahead and has been able to have a business of her own to insure her son\u2019s education and future.\r\n\r\nThe people who make up this group and their various activities are as follows:\r\nRosalva-fast food snacks\r\nSara-embroidery\r\nAmada- embroidery\r\nRicarda- embroidery\r\nAdela- embroidery\r\nCarmen-notions\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2150,"image":{"id":912962,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy oil, salt, rice, tomatoes, chili peppers, meat, etc. and also to buy fabric, muslin, thread and needles to continue making napkins.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2011-11-16T20:50:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2150,"lender_count":75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sara","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Amada","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ricarda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Adela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Carmen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosalva","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-10-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":29000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":2150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":5800},{"due_date":"2012-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":5800},{"due_date":"2012-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":5800},{"due_date":"2012-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":5800},{"due_date":"2012-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":5800}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":430},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":430},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":430},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":430},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":430}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":377.35,"local_amount":5089.8,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:12:41Z","rounded_local_amount":5101.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250785093},{"amount":411.94,"local_amount":5556.42,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T10:28:06Z","rounded_local_amount":5569.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257193656},{"amount":431.62,"local_amount":5821.88,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:42:26Z","rounded_local_amount":5835.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263330018},{"amount":352.43,"local_amount":4753.76,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T09:41:44Z","rounded_local_amount":4764.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270044058},{"amount":370.29,"local_amount":4994.57,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:51:34Z","rounded_local_amount":5006.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276656361},{"amount":206.37,"local_amount":2783.57,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T16:51:31Z","rounded_local_amount":2790.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283317654}],"funded_date":"2011-11-18T12:33:46Z","paid_date":"2012-06-15T16:51:31Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":362514,"name":"Mar\u00eda Mercedes","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El Grupo De Cr\u00e9dito Mar\u00eda Inmaculada se re\u00fane cada quince d\u00edas  en La parroquia La Sequita de Montecristi (Portoviejo), cant\u00f3n conocido  por los famosos sombreros de paja toquilla que son apreciados dentro y fuera del pa\u00eds.\n\nEn este lugar vive la se\u00f1ora Mar\u00eda, tiene 34 a\u00f1os de edad, est\u00e1 casada y de esta relaci\u00f3n tienen seis hijos de 18, 16, 14, 11, 7 y 5 a\u00f1os de edad, todos estudian en colegio y escuela y el menor en jard\u00edn de infantes.
