The venture to which she dedicates the majority of her time is a stand selling candies on a busy street in Ayacucho, Peru. She tends to this stand every single day of the week. As an \u201cambulante,\u201d Mauricia has a stand on wheels, and when business is slow in one area, she has the capability to pick up and move to a more profitable section, taking advantage of greater flows of traffic. Mauricia explains that she loves her job because she is her own boss and it allows her the freedom to move about, taking advantage of the most visited and traffic-heavy areas of the city. <P>\r\n\r\nAlthough she enjoys selling candies, Mauricia\u2019s second business is the one she is working to develop into a full-time job. This business consists of renting out the \u201cmoto-taxi\u201d she saved so diligently to buy. A moto-taxi is a type of covered three-wheel motorcycle with a backseat, and they are the principal means of public transportation throughout this small Andean city. Every morning, the chauffeur to whom she has rented the taxi drives her to her stand and then he sets off earning money during the day. Mauricia charges 25 Soles per day to rent her taxi, or about US$ 8.50. This is an ideal way to make a living, explains Mauricia, and her dream is to save up enough money to buy a fleet of taxis that she would rent out daily. <P>\r\n\r\nA major factor allowing her to work diligently toward her dream business has been her involvement with her village bank. Having been the catalyst to her hard work and savings, Mauricia is very grateful to her bank. There, she has learned how to save her money and has received the economic support necessary to grow her business and accumulate capital. The reason she works so hard is to put food on the table for her children and facilitate their high school and college educations. Thanks to the loans she receives, this is a goal that is always met. <P>\r\n\r\nMauricia is requesting a loan of US$ 425. This money will be put toward the repair of her moto-taxi because although it is profitable, it not necessarily a reliable type of automobile, requiring continual maintenance. She will buy new tires and cylinders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":88356,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Motorcycle Transport","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"To buy new tires and cylinders for her moto-taxi","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":70,"posted_date":"2007-11-25T01:10:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"lender_count":6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mauricia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-12-09T01:42:24Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1200,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2008-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2008-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2008-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":300}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":106.25},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":106.25},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":106.25},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":106.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":107,"local_amount":302.12,"processed_date":"2008-01-09T10:15:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-09T09:30:54Z","rounded_local_amount":319.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":112788},{"amount":107,"local_amount":302.12,"processed_date":"2008-02-09T10:15:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-09T09:30:54Z","rounded_local_amount":319.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":132136},{"amount":107,"local_amount":302.12,"processed_date":"2008-03-09T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-09T09:30:54Z","rounded_local_amount":319.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":153935},{"amount":104,"local_amount":293.65,"processed_date":"2008-04-09T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-09T09:30:54Z","rounded_local_amount":310.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":178120}],"funded_date":"2007-11-25T01:42:24Z","paid_date":"2008-04-09T09:13:53Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":29362,"name":"Sek","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Sek R., 42, is married with six children and lives in Bathambong province, Cambodia.

In fact, if you are a regular lender on Kiva.org, you may be tired of reading about kuku. \"Who or what are kuku?\" you may ask. Kuku means chickens in Swahili, and raising them for sale is popular for a number of reasons. Firstly, they require little start-up capital. You can start with one or two and either add to them as you go or wait for them to multiply naturally! Secondly, they require little space, so sometimes you can just let them run around in your garden or compound. Thirdly, while they are growing they produce eggs, which can either be sold to provide a supplementary source of income or eaten to provide a supplementary source of protein. I\u2019m sure there are hundreds of other reasons why raising kuku is so popular (maybe they are friendlier than other animals or prettier?), but this is all time and space will allow."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":119954,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility.

Usuf\u2019s sons already have their own families.  His oldest son is carpenter, making 500 somoni every month.  The younger son is a bus mechanic, making 350 somoni per month.  Usuf\u2019s daughter is still very young and goes to school.  Because a teacher\u2019s salary is very low in this country, Usuf is also involved in animal husbandry.  His wife and daughters-in-law help him with the business.  When Usuf first obtained a loan, he had 7 heads of livestock and has 9 today.  He wants to obtain this second loan in order to feed his livestock and resell it at a market.  He plans to increase his livestock quantity to 11 heads. \r\n<p>\r\nMLF \u201cMicroInvest\u201d is one of the leading microfinance organizations, rendering credit services to the population of Tajikistan.

Kenya. He is married to Emily and they have five children.\r\n\r\nJames currently sells various fish such as tilapia and omena. Omena is a small two-inch long fish found in Lake Victoria in Western Kenya.

She lives in her own home with her partner Primitivo, age 30, and their three children who are her reason for living.  For more than ten years, she and her husband have been growing different varieties of potatoes.  She also raises animals such as bulls, sheep, and pigs.  Nilda keeps the animals near the fields where she works so that she can keep watch of them.  What she enjoys most is planting potato seedlings.  In order to give them enough space to develop, she must dig furrows and overturn large amounts of soil to keep the seedlings covered until they mature.  Known for her enthusiasm, Nilda is confident that farming is a profitable endeavor.  With her earnings, she plans to buy more farmland so that she can cover her household expenses and pay for her children\u2019s education.  She wants to continue farming, but on larger tracts of land.  Nilda also plans to buy more cattle for fattening so that she can sell them on holidays.  \r\n<p>\r\nThis is her fourth loan with MFP.

Su principal mercado son los grandes confeccionistas a quienes les ofrece el servicio de maquila, mujeres a quienes les confecciona sobre sus medidas y almacenes y miscel\u00e1neas. Mabel inici\u00f3 su negocio desde el a\u00f1o 2005, cuando despu\u00e9s de haber trabajado en una confecci\u00f3n, se retir\u00f3 para emprender su propia aventura de negocios en un taller de confecciones, que ubic\u00f3 en el sitio de su vivienda. Ella compr\u00f3 mediante 2 cr\u00e9ditos las maquinarias de segunda mano, que pag\u00f3 fabricando jeans, a quien se las vendi\u00f3. Su negocio ha ido creciendo en su infraestructura y hoy tiene 7 m\u00e1quinas, cuenta con 3 empleados y en temporadas en las que aumentan las ventas contrata dos m\u00e1s. Su sue\u00f1o es independizar su espacio familiar del espacio productivo, para tener el tan anhelado sosiego, por eso su meta m\u00e1s adelante es tener un local con un punto comercial, donde pueda exhibir y vender los dise\u00f1os que produce. Su mayor desaf\u00edo es la selecci\u00f3n de clientes que solicitan cr\u00e9ditos a largo plazo y ella no tiene las condiciones de capital para financiar totalmente su cartera. Esta es la raz\u00f3n por la cual acude a su credikiva, primer financiamiento que hace a la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, con el cual comprar\u00e1 materias primas e insumos de confecci\u00f3n, para producir ropa a clientes que requieren plazos mayores, pues viven las ciudades de Barranquilla y Monter\u00eda y necesita sostener este mercado, conocido y muy rentable.

She crafts all styles of clothing. Her primary market is the large wholesalers, offering them manufacturing services. A group of women who produce according to specifications and the products are destined for clothing, and general stores. Mabel started out her business in 2005 after having retired from her employment as a seamstress. She decided to take up her own business venture with a tailoring shop, set up in her house. With the help of 2 loans she bought second-hand sewing machines. She repaid the loans by producing jeans for those who sold her the machines. Her business has been increasing in infrastructure and today she has 7 sewing machines and 3 employees. During those seasons when there is an increase in sales she hires two other employees. Her dream is to separate her family living space from her business and production space in order to enjoy the peace she has wanted for so long. For this reason her long-term goal is to have a commercial store space where she will be able to exhibit and sell her designs. Her greatest challenge is approving clients who request long-term credit plans, as well as not having the capital funds hat she needs to complete finance her business. This is the reason why she requests a Kiva loan. It is the first loan she requests through Fundacion Mario Santo Domingo (Kiva Field Partner). With her loan she will purchase materials and sewing products to produce articles of clothing for clients who require longer term credit plans. Her clients live in the city of Barranquilla and Monteria and she needs to sustain this market, as it is already well-known to her and it is very profitable. As Mabel works to accomplish her dreams she strives to maintain a contribution margin of no less than 27% and a profit margin no less than 19%. She aspires to increase her profit margin with this new injection of funds to her working capital. She will be able to make her purchases in cash and in larger quantities than usual."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":840547,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Tailoring","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to purchase products and sewing materials to craft articles of clothing.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Soledad Atl\u00e0ntico","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2011-08-15T13:20:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":600,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mabel ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-07-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1070000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":96042},{"due_date":"2011-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":99933},{"due_date":"2011-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":101849},{"due_date":"2011-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":103801},{"due_date":"2012-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":105790},{"due_date":"2012-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":107818},{"due_date":"2012-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":109885},{"due_date":"2012-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":111991},{"due_date":"2012-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":114137},{"due_date":"2012-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":118754}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.86},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.03},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.11},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.21},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.32},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.46},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.62},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.8},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.59}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":53.86,"local_amount":96042,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:05:36Z","rounded_local_amount":96670.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232803725},{"amount":56.03,"local_amount":99933,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:18:08Z","rounded_local_amount":100586.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238614804},{"amount":57.11,"local_amount":101849,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-21T08:53:59Z","rounded_local_amount":102515.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244568757},{"amount":58.21,"local_amount":103801,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:06:51Z","rounded_local_amount":104480.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250780084},{"amount":59.32,"local_amount":105790,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T10:20:23Z","rounded_local_amount":106482.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257188477},{"amount":60.46,"local_amount":107818,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:36:12Z","rounded_local_amount":108523.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263324694},{"amount":61.62,"local_amount":109885,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T09:30:33Z","rounded_local_amount":110603.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270038753},{"amount":193.39,"local_amount":344882,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:44:16Z","rounded_local_amount":347138.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276650916}],"funded_date":"2011-08-16T15:17:23Z","paid_date":"2012-05-15T09:44:16Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":329331,"name":"Ana Lucia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La Se\u00f1ora Ana es socia del banco comunal Bankito Progresista, vive en la ciudad de Cuenca, ciudad que es muy visitada por la belleza de su centro colonial, esta ba\u00f1ada por 4 r\u00edos, su gente mantiene la cultura y tradiciones, la gran variedad en su gastronom\u00eda cautiva el paladar de propio y extra\u00f1os.\n \nDo\u00f1a Ana tiene 34 a\u00f1os, es casada y en su uni\u00f3n conyugal ha concebido 3 hijos de 13, 11 y 5 a\u00f1os de edad, su primer hijo est\u00e1 estudiando en el colegio y sus dos \u00faltimos hijos  en la escuela.

She sells more than 40 Kgs of tomatoes every day.\r\n\r\nBack in 2000, Evaline practiced traditional farming with little knowledge and no financing at all. She was doing only half an acre of maize crop per season. The returns were so meager that she could barely fend for survival. She kept doing maize farming for years without turning a profit until 2013, when she switched to tomato farming and there was light at the end of the tunnel for Evaline. \r\n\r\nToday, Evaline is a fully-fledged entrepreneur. She has been provided with technical guidance, training programs and exposure visits. She has already serviced other asset-based loans fully from Juhudi Kilimo! Through the loans, she has acquired high quality dairy cows, farm implements and fertilizers. She has employed one permanent staff from the village to help run her agribusiness. \r\n\r\nTo capitalize more on returns from the booming tomato farming, Evaline is seeking a loan of KES 130,000 to build another greenhouse. Unlike his competition, Evaline conducts proper soil preparation and uses modern farming techniques to ensure high quality produce. By doing this, she has created a name for herself and a demand for her produce. \r\n\r\nYour lending will contribute greatly to the actualization of Evaline\u2019s goal, which is to expand the greenhouse. In the future, she is also planning to introduce zero grazing method, intensify her maize farming, and start value

And so, she began to sell hamburgers from her home, and with time saw her business grow. Now she has many customers and her own stock is not enough to keep up with demand. <p> In order to meet demand, Benita is applying for a loan of $200.00 so that she can purchase a hamburger stand that she has seen is being sold and with the stand prepare and sell her hamburgers in a more timely manner.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility.

They know one another through community ties in the Rail Ko district of Diamarabougou.  They are all highly active in the traditional association and work essentially in buying and selling grain, fish, soap, and charcoal. \r\n<p>\r\nConcerned about satisfying their burgeoning customer base, they decided to join the Soro Yiriwaso loan program, with which they are on their second loan, the first one being repaid.  The new loan will be use to buy:  405 kg of fresh fish (some of it sold fresh and half of it fried), sacks of onion, and charcoal.  Supplies of fish are gotten every day on the banks of the Niger River and at the Kirango marketplace.  While the charcoal is sold at home, the fish is sold fresh door-to-door in the Rail Ko district and is also sold fried across from the hospital.  Cash is accepted, and sometimes credit, from customers composed of women and men. \r\n<p>\r\nThe group members intend to realize an average profit of 41,250 francs CFA per month that will be used generally for paying the loan interest, covering the school costs for the children, providing for family needs, and making payments to the tontine (community revolving credit system).  Their ambition is to have a house. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":264011,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"To buy fish and charcoal   ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"S\u00e9gou","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2009-03-01T08:00:15Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":750,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Fanta              ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kosso             ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatoumata       ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mariam             ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatoumata        ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-13T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":375000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2009-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2009-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2009-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2009-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2009-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":62500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":250,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2009-03-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T22:08:46Z","rounded_local_amount":126781.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27135782},{"amount":125,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2009-04-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:29:27Z","rounded_local_amount":63390.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36033583},{"amount":125,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2009-05-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:40:08Z","rounded_local_amount":63390.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44620951},{"amount":125,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2009-06-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:22:16Z","rounded_local_amount":63390.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53019916},{"amount":125,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2009-07-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T19:19:48Z","rounded_local_amount":63390.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63242661}],"funded_date":"2009-03-02T07:03:28Z","paid_date":"2009-08-15T19:19:48Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Daniel Kuey","image":669418}},{"id":90841,"name":"Channy","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Channy N. is a villager in Ta Pang Choeurng village in Takeo province.

For the past 31 years he has made a living in agricultural and raising cattle. Although sometimes he had to prioritize his labors in the fields, he never neglected his animals, which are his working tools with which he provides plowing services to his neighbors at 50 to 60 soles per field. For this reason he never neglects to plants oats, which is the primary food for his cattle. Between November and January is the time when fields are prepared for planting, and it's when M\u00e1ximo and his cattle have the majority of their work. He dedicates himself to his crops the remainder of the year and eventually sells them at the market in the city of Tarma. M\u00e1ximo is very satisfied with the work he carries out, since thanks to these activities he was able to educate every one of his six children. This is his third loan with Kiva partner MFP and during this time he has shown himself to be very punctual with each of his payments. With the 2000 soles he's requesting, he plans to invest in the purchase of oat seeds to harvest and feed his cattle. He will purchase fertilizer to enrich his potato fields with the rest of the money.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Marty Greenstein, Kiva

Ismoil is 26 years old. He is married with three children. Since he was a very young he has been in the business of raising and selling cattle which is why he has a lot of experience. It is necessary to point out that he has been able to succeed thanks to the support provided by IMON International. This support has been in the form of a loan which he has used to purchase and raise young bulls in their locality. Today, Ismoil has once again come to IMON International for a loan which will allow him to purchase young bulls to raise and sell. It is his biggest dream to improve the conditions of his business in order to then improve the conditions of his family.  \n\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\n\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is the oldest of all her siblings and lives at home with her parents.\r\n<p>\r\nHeydy hopes to become a professional.  Last year she began studying for a technical degree at an executive secretarial school in the city.  During the week, she transitions from farm work to her work in the classroom.  On the weekends, Heydy provides invaluable support to her father.  Early the morning, she establishes herself in the fields in order to pull weeds and fertilize the coffee plants.  Coffee is the preferred crop because it is very profitable.  A coffee farmer can accumulate money very quickly during the months of May through July.  Meanwhile, her mother supports her by providing meals, so Heyde shares in the profits with her parents and also saves enough money to cover her educational expenses.\r\n<p>\r\nThis is her second loan with MFP.

She works everyday offering cell phone calls as a street vendor.  Her eye-catching green vest and the joy that she has have made her one of the most popular, and her business is going very well.  What she likes best about her work is talking with her customers and helping them communicate with the people to whom they want to talk.  She has been doing this for eight years.  The most difficult part is having to stand all day waiting for customers, which is very tiring and grueling.  In the future she wants to have a location for her call center.  That way she would be able to improve her earnings.\r\n\r\nThis is Isabel\u2019s third loan with MFP.  She was very punctual with her first loans, and she expects to do the same now as well.

He is a hardworking person who is very dedicated to his family.  Percy works as a taxi driver on call 24 hours a day.  His wife sells fast food at the door of their house.  Because of her condition, she had to stop working temporarily until their baby got stronger.  The children help their mother every night while she is running her business and their father is still out until the early morning hours.  When he comes home in the mornings, Percy takes his kids to school and then comes home to rest.  In the afternoon, he is back at work because the evening hours are when he generates most of his earnings.  Percy will use his loan to repair his vehicle, since this is his source of income for supporting his family.  \r\n<p>\r\nThe other members are engaged in businesses involving clothing, cosmetics, handicrafts, groceries, electronic appliances, tailoring services, and transportation.  The loan will be used as operating capital to buy more products.  Others will buy provisions and the rest will use their loan to repair equipment used in their work.  Most of the members expect to have successful businesses.  Through their hard work and dedication, they will be able to improve their income in a honest manner and proviD. their families with a better quality of life.  The group does not have much experience working with solidarity loans.  They have started their first loan cycle and have demonstrated in their meetings that they are enthusiastic individuals who greatly desire to succeed.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan

While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are each collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nJoyce is married and has one baby.  To make a living, Joyce owns and operates a general store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income comes from selling a variety of different products in the local community. Joyce has been engaged in her business for over two years and earns approximately 5,000 PHP a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Joyce joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Joyce is requesting a first loan of 15,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional inventory and to provide working capital. She plans to use the additional revenue generated to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She lives in her parents' house and what she wishes for most is to get ahead in life. In the small community of Miraflores, Rosmeri has spent the greater part of her life. At a young age, she learned her family business and it is due to this that now she is dedicated to farming bananas and coffee, work that has provided her with the income necessary to support herself. Everything that she produces, she sells in the market in the city of Merced, which is where she obtains the greatest prices for her products. What she likes most about her job is sowing her land, which she does with much care. She has been doing this work for three years and considers transporting goods to market the most difficult part since the means of transportation are scarce in her area.

He mostly deals in bananas in the food markets in that district. Joseph is single with no kids and he says he was inspired by his friend to try his hand at this business. \r\n\r\nThe decision he took to begin this source of livelihood has in many ways made him proud. Joseph says living by his wits was a proposition that he dreaded. Before, he was before engaged in  a small farming business but it did not help that much as most of the food he was growing was harvested for home consumption.\r\n\r\nMonthly he says this business generates shillings 300,000 as profit and he says with this loan, he is going to purchase more foods like sweet potatoes, rice, maize, etc. which he says sell at higher prices on the local market.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture, and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous, and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is 46 and a resident of Manila, Philippines. She is married to Eduardo, a vendor, and mother to four children. She, together with her husband, manages her own household while operating her business. Filipina is a fish vendor who works hard to continually provide income for her family\u2019s everyday expenses. She buys different kinds of fish at wholesale prices and sells them by the kilo. Many patrons prefer her products, since she buys fish at the local fish port early in the morning and her customers are assured of its freshness and cleanliness. Her store is located in a temporary fish market and her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. Filipina earns a minimum of 1,000 PHP in sales every day.\r\n\r\nFilipina is requesting a 15,000 PHP loan to help continue her business. She will use her loan to buy more fish to sell every day and she expects a boost in her business income as she expands. Filipina dreams of giving all of her children a good and high quality education through her hard work.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. \r\n\r\nThis leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":336732,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To purchase crops in bulk for her business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbeya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.9 33.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-06-15T14:30:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":475,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mwasiti","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-07-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":600000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2010-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":79.17,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-08-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:54:40Z","rounded_local_amount":104104.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73664965},{"amount":79.17,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T02:52:20Z","rounded_local_amount":104104.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87105677},{"amount":79.17,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-10-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T06:33:25Z","rounded_local_amount":104104.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97022787},{"amount":79.17,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:45:36Z","rounded_local_amount":104104.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103868028},{"amount":79.17,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-12-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T16:45:52Z","rounded_local_amount":104104.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110757224},{"amount":79.15,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2010-01-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:34:41Z","rounded_local_amount":104104.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118146336}],"funded_date":"2009-06-16T01:57:07Z","paid_date":"2010-02-15T12:34:41Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jeff Avery","image":233371}},{"id":119529,"name":"Zhumabubu's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This loan group\u2019s leader, Zhumabubu, is a widow and mother of three daughters and one son.

While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are both collectively responsible for paying back the loan of their fellow group member if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nAna is single. To make a living, Ana owns & operates a business venture in the agriculture sector, raising crops. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from planting & harvesting rice for sale. Ana has been engaged in her business for over 5 years and earns approximately 4,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2005, Ana joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Ana has successfully repaid a previous loan of 4,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to to purchase fertilizers such as manure. Ana is requesting a new loan of 4000 PHP which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This will be the 7th loan taken out by Ana from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao.

Tampalon, Kabankalan City, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating one business venture: a food vending business.  Her husband Hansel S., who is 29 years old, works as a farmer to earn his living and also helps in his wife's business activities. They have one child who is three years old.\r\n\r\n Charity joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2009 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 3 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Charity has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 8,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 10,000, thus uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 4th loan, she is borrowing PHP 12,000 which she intends to use to purchase raw materials so that she can continue to save up for the future and support her children's education.  \r\n\r\nCharity S. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\n\r\n In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed on a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.

She has been doing this for several years and the business has done well thanks to her hard work. Every month she makes sweaters in response to the orders placed by her customers.

It's located at an elevation of 2880 meters and its mainstays are farming, livestock, and business.  The Huancayo \u2013 Huancavelica railroad runs to the district.\r\n\r\nOlga is an associate of Bancomunal.  She has three children, ages 19, 11, and 4.  She has been running a small grocery and vegetable store for the past 10 years and has added prepared food to her sales in recent years, she now wants to complement it with coffee and juices.  Each day she adds something to her business in order to make it grow.  Two of her children attend school and the third one is very young.  They don't help her with her business very much, but thanks to the loans she's gotten, she's been able to grow and invest more into her business.\r\n\r\nOlga is asking for a 1,000 PEN loan in order to buy products for her business, and also a juicer so that she can sell juices.  Her dream is to grow with her business so that she can support her children so that they will continue with their studies to the highest achievement.  Olga is motivated by her children.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Hugo Reyes, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":591307,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Inventory and a juicer","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Huancavelica","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.766667 -74.983333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":70,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":4475,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Olga","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lucia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yesenia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Leocadia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mercede","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alejandrina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elvira","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lourdes","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Benedicta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Soledad","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Enma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ninfa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Estela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yolanda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-08-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":12500,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":4475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.35},{"due_date":"2010-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.35},{"due_date":"2010-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.35},{"due_date":"2010-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.35},{"due_date":"2011-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.25},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":745.84},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":745.84},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":745.84},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":745.84},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":745.8},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":745.84}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Hugo E.

Teachers of this noble institution have come to SMT, a partner of Kiva.org in Makeni, northern Sierra Leone, to seek a loan of SLL 6,500,000 for the entire group. With the help of this loan, this group of teachers will each be able to improve their standard of living. \r\n\r\nFifty-five year old Jessika K. K. is the leader of this group of teachers. Jessika was born in Kailahun, she is married and has 2 children who are in college. Jessika is a teacher and a businesswoman. She has been in the teaching profession for 35 years now. Jessika is going to use her share of this loan to invest in her business. \r\n\r\nSchool staff from this institution, like many other schools staff within SMT\u2019s operational areas, come to SMT to apply for loans. With the help of these loans, they can accomplish some certain tasks that they would otherwise have not been able to accomplish with their mere salaries alone.

(a potato-like tuber) for sale. She has one year of experience in this business.    \r\n\r\nPaosia needs a loan of WST $1,000 to purchase general farm supplies and equipment. She plans to use the profit from her business (estimated to be 260 WST or US $108 per week) to improve and expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2011, Paosia joined SPBD to gain access to financial services. Most of SPBD's clients are unable to borrow from commercial banks because they lack collateral. This is Paosia's first loan with SPBD. \r\n\r\n*SPBD evaluates the living conditions of each of its borrowers. Generally, a loan manager evaluates a variety of social metrics on a scale out of 1 to 3 (the higher the number, the better off the person is) and these are averaged for the overall social metric score. For example, a 3 out of 3 on \"level of education\" would mean that the borrower has graduated from university.  \r\n\r\nAbout SPBD: \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem. Please join SPBD's lending team on Kiva to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD.

She wants this investment to encourage business growth and to attract more customers.\r\n\r\nThe remaining members of the group are:\r\nRoque who sells groceries\r\nFiliberto who sells groceries\r\nAdrian who sells bread\r\nEsperanza who sells groceries\r\nJulian who sell groceries\r\nDaniela who sells groceries\r\nGuadalupe who is a dressmaker\r\nLuz Elena who sells groceries\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1350,"image":{"id":984431,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"buy cooking oil, rice, beans, creams, canned chiles, coffee, candles, matches, toilet paper, toothpaste, soap, clorox, soft drinks, and sweets to sell.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2012-01-22T20:40:16Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1350,"lender_count":43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Roque ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Emeranda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Filiberto ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Adrian ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Esperanza ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Julian ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Daniela ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Guadalupe ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Luz Elena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-12-21T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":18000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":1350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":2250},{"due_date":"2012-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":2250},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":2250},{"due_date":"2012-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":2250},{"due_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","amount":2250},{"due_date":"2012-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":2250},{"due_date":"2012-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":2250},{"due_date":"2012-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":2250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":168.75},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":168.75},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":168.75},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":168.75},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":168.75},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":168.75},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":168.75},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":168.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":337.5,"local_amount":4500,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T10:28:09Z","rounded_local_amount":4527.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257193944},{"amount":506.25,"local_amount":6750,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:41:37Z","rounded_local_amount":6791.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263330302},{"amount":337.5,"local_amount":4500,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T09:41:35Z","rounded_local_amount":4527.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270044320},{"amount":168.75,"local_amount":2250,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:49:22Z","rounded_local_amount":2263.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276656512}],"funded_date":"2012-01-23T04:51:30Z","paid_date":"2012-05-15T09:49:22Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Harold Sims","image":602722}},{"id":481239,"name":"Francisco Tito","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Francisco es un hombre de 36 a\u00f1os, vive en la ciudad de Caman\u00e1 con su esposa, \u00e9l es una persona muy amable, trabajador y entusiasta, que tiene un gran deseo de superaci\u00f3n;

Previously she offered her services to clothing business in various shopping centers, like the File Halter shopping center that is currently trying to grow its small businesses in order to achieve a greater market abroad. As she is separated, during the whole time that her four children were underage she could never save enough to invest to begin her own business, because all of her profits were used to cover the expenses of raising her children. Nevertheless, when they grew and became independent economically, Lida could begin her dream of having her own business. One of her first investments was to buy industrial sewing machines to make and repair clothes. She already has four. Since four years ago, she has a rented a space in a shopping center where she sells the clothes she produces. During the busy season, she contracts a person to help with production. Now she uses her profits to cover her personal expenses and to help support her mother who lives in Juliaca. She began to take out loans with EDAPROSPO, an affiliate of Kiva, six months ago. But she already has plans to use her loans in the future in order to buy a local space to stabilize her business. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Lois Parshley, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":150,"image":{"id":287468,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cloth & Dressmaking Supplies","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Invest in a showcase to better display her products.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

He does all types of sandwiches and burgers; he also makes \u201cfalafel\u201d sandwiches and \u201ckebab\u201d. <P>\r\n\r\nFalafel is very popular in the Middle East as a fast food. As a main dish, it is served as a sandwich, stuffed in pita bread with lettuce, tomatoes, and tahini. As an appetizer, it is served on a salad, or with hummus and tahini. As for the Kebabs or also known as \"shish kebab\": Shish kebab is translated to 'skewer of grilled meat' and includes many variations of the kebab; therefore, there are several spellings, such as kabob, kebob, kebap, kabab, and kebab. <P>\r\n\r\nWhen Hussein first started his business, he had to pass through some financial issues because he wasn\u2019t really known and didn\u2019t have his own customers. Hussein decided on doing his business because of his experience. Hussein requested a loan from Al Majmoua in order to purchase merchandise for his restaurant and a coffee machine. This machine will help him to start serving coffee and expand his snack food into a real restaurant. This is his second loan and he repaid the first loan on time. His customers are people from his region. In the future, he plans on improving his business.

Having had eight group loans, all of which she repaid on time, she is now on her third individual loan (the two previous ones having also been repaid on time). \r\n\r\nShe is planning on  buying sacks of wheat flower from wholesalers in Koutiala; she sells her goods at the Kouloukoro market and at home to a customer base which is predominantly feminine, for cash and on credit.\r\n\r\nWith the reinforcement of her business, she expects to make an average profit of 75,000FCFA per month, which she plans to use to pay the interest on her loan from Soro, to contribute to her family's expenses and to look after herself as well as her children. \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Alison Le Bras, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":534815,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"Purchase of wheat flour","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Koutiala","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2010-05-03T18:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":525,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Aminata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-04-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":250000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2010-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2010-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2010-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2010-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2010-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":41666.67,"processed_date":"2010-05-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T10:03:25Z","rounded_local_amount":43374.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144779268},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":41666.67,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:17:00Z","rounded_local_amount":43374.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151961480},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":41666.67,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T12:01:29Z","rounded_local_amount":43374.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159699600},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":41666.67,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:58:34Z","rounded_local_amount":43374.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166913487},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":41666.67,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:41:08Z","rounded_local_amount":43374.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172180652},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":41666.65,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T16:14:26Z","rounded_local_amount":43374.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177476623}],"funded_date":"2010-05-03T23:41:12Z","paid_date":"2010-11-15T16:14:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Alison Le Bras","image":608879}},{"id":202359,"name":"Esterlita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Esterlita D. is from the village of Camanucan.

Dilshod lives in Gonchi, a region in Northern Tajikistan. He is 29 years old, married with two children. Dilshod is the sole provider for his family and earns his living by raising and selling cows at the local market. His wife helps him with the business. Once every 2-3 months he purchases young animals from local villagers and raises them over an 8-9 month period and later sells the adult cows to local butchers. Today Dilshod is thinking about expanding his business, as his current earnings are not enough to provide for his family. He plans to purchase young cattle.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is a hard-working woman who strives to provide the best she can for her daughter, Briyid, who is 11 years old.  They live together in a rented house in the Kimbiri district.  They used to live in their own home but, because of family problems, had to move out.  Her parents taught her how to work to make a living for herself.  Her business is buying products such as coffee, cocoa, annatto and tumeric, mainly forest area crops, from the indians.  She's been in the business for four years and has the help of workers who load and weigh the items she purchases.  She uses a vehicle to travel around to different communities in search of her products which she then transfers to the well-known co-ops such as \"Cooperativa Agraria\", \"Cacao Vrae\" and \"Machupichu\" who pay her a percentage for each kilogram she delivers.\r\n\r\nHer business is very profitable and she receives an annual premium from the co-ops.  The months of January, February and March are the rainy season and roads are flooded, so during these months she lags behind in her business.

Before joining the transportation service, Volodymyr used to work in the state security service, but then, after his wife gave birth to a daughter, he left that employment and started working as a taxi driver.
