He is 22 years old and married. To make a living, Jeffie owns and operates a business venture in the services sector, operating transportation services. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from operating a tricycle for transportation services. Jeffie has been engaged in this business for over 1 year and earns approximately 9300 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2009, Jeffie joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and his ability to engage in business activities. Jeffie is requesting a loan of 8000 PHP, which will be used for additional payment for his motorcycle for transportation services. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Jeffie from GDMPC. He plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of his family. \r\n<p>\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n<p>\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.\r\n<p>\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She is a mother and very hardworking. She lives with her husband and her 4 children in their own house. She makes jewelry with wire, crystals, and beads. \r\n\r\nShe is skilled in making pendants and earrings and each model is unique. She offers her creations for sale on a piece of flannel so that her customers can easily choose the jewelry they like. When her children were small, they sometimes made it difficult to work; they are now her loyal collaborators and with their help, she can finish orders on time. She is very happy with what she makes because she can do this at home, where she also sells breakfasts. She has been working in this business for 8 years. One of her difficulties is not having appropriate tools that would make it easier to work. Her greatest wish for the future is to have a jewelry workshop. \r\n\r\nThis is her twelfth loan with Microfinanzas Prisma.

dice que en tiempos de calor sus bordados no se venden, porque como son de lana es dificil que una persona quiera comprar un chaleco, tambien nos dice que las ventas son un  albhur, para poder salir a vender nesecita llevarse todo lo que hizo para ense\u00f1arles al cliente su trabajo, pero como puedes vender cosas como te puedes regresar con ellas, por eso nos comenta que es un albhur, otra cosa que se le hace dificil es andar cargando las cosas, y es mucho peso el que se junta y si se hace muy complicado cargar toda sus cosas, a do\u00f1a Angelina le gustaria ya tener suguras sus ventas nadamas dedicarse a entregar pedidos, porque sus hijos estan estudiando y quiere que salgan adelante, el credito le ha servido de mucho para poder hacer sus bordados y manda un mensaje de agradecimiento por los creditos para su negocio, la se\u00f1ora tiene 4 hijos, lleva 8 a\u00f1os de casada, y 37 a\u00f1os de edad, vive en casa propia y su esposo trabaja y tambien nos dice que sabe

trees and it's also the location of the Mazahua ceremonial center.  It is said that not long ago there were deer here, but as of a few years ago they were gone.  \n\nDo\u00f1a Angelina has a group that calls themselves \"Las Artesanas del Fresno\" (The Artisans of Fresno).  They are so named because the 8 members are artisans who know how to do embroidery and sewing, and they are from El Fresno.  It is for this reason that they are named this way.\n\nDo\u00f1a Angelina works buying fabric by the meter for making bedspreads, blankets and waistcoats.  She has 15 years of experience and knows how to embroider very well.  She tells us that there are several things that hinder sales.  For example, she tells us that in hot weather her embroidery does not sell; as her waistcoats are made from wool it is difficult for a person to want to buy one.  She also says that making sales is a gamble.  To be able to go out to make sales, she needs to bring everything she has made \u200b\u200bso as to educate her customer about her work, but while she may sell some items, she needs to return with the rest, which is why she tells us it's a gamble.  Another thing that makes it hard is carrying the items, as they are very heavy together which makes it very difficult to carry all her items.  Do\u00f1a Angelina would like to have reliable sales and only offer items to meet orders, because her children are attending school and she wants them to progress in life.\n\nThe loan has done a great deal for her embroidery business, and she sends a message of thanks for the loans for her business.  The se\u00f1ora has 4 children; she has been married for 8 years and is 37 years old.  She lives in her own house and her husband works.  She also tells us that he knows how to embroider, and provides her with help.\n\nThe other members of the group are named:\n1.-Maria de los Angeles\n2.-Leonila \n3.-Lucia \n4.-Gregoria \n5.-Rufina \n6.-Rosio \n7.-Juana Iris \n\nAll the members are artisans and work in the same field, embroidering tablecloths and sewing of all different kinds."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1875,"image":{"id":825248,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Embroidery","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"to buy fabric for embroidery.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"San Felipe del Progreso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2011-08-16T19:00:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1875,"lender_count":70,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Angelina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria De Los Angeles Manuela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Leonila","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lucia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gregoria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rufina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosio ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juna Iris","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-07-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":23000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":1875,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":2875},{"due_date":"2011-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":2875},{"due_date":"2011-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":2875},{"due_date":"2011-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":2875},{"due_date":"2011-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":2875},{"due_date":"2011-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":2875},{"due_date":"2011-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":2875},{"due_date":"2011-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":2875}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":234.38},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":234.37},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":234.38},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":234.37},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":234.38},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":234.37},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":234.38},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":234.37}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":468.75,"local_amount":5750,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-16T08:11:04Z","rounded_local_amount":5826.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227201969},{"amount":468.75,"local_amount":5750,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:11:59Z","rounded_local_amount":5826.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232807561},{"amount":468.75,"local_amount":5750,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:22:29Z","rounded_local_amount":5826.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238618655},{"amount":468.75,"local_amount":5750,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:04:19Z","rounded_local_amount":5826.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244572897}],"funded_date":"2011-08-16T22:54:38Z","paid_date":"2011-12-15T10:04:19Z","journal_totals":{"entries":4,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Arabella Pollack","image":null}},{"id":329799,"name":"Lucy","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Lucy es socia del Banco Comunal Proyecci\u00f3n, tiene 53 a\u00f1os.

She sells rice by the quintal (hundred pound sacks.)  She sells a lot of quintals of rice to her customers from her house, because this is a staple product in the households of her country.  She receives the rice directly from the rice mills, and later sells it to her customers.  She provides her customers with payment terms, since she sells on credit, and she collects every week.  She has been doing this work for 2 years, and it is going very well.  She likes it because she earns money without having to neglect her small children.  \r\n\r\nThis loan will be used to buy 100-pound sacks of rice.  This is her first loan with the communal bank.

SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem. SPBD evaluates the living conditions of each of its borrowers.  Generally, a loan manager evaluates a variety of social metrics on a scale out of 3 (the higher the number, the better off the person is) and these are averaged for the \"\"overall social metric score.\"\"  For example, a 3 out of 3 on \"level of education\" would mean that the borrower has graduated from university.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot

He is married with one child, age nine years-old. His wife assists him in the store. Their only child is currently attending school. \r\n\r\nDonald runs a clothing store in Krootown, where he sells clothes for men and women. He has been running this business for 13 years. He works at his store from Monday until Saturday, six days per week and eight hours a day from 8:50 am \u2013 5:30 pm. He has a passion for business, and his business is the only source of income he has. He says that the main challenge to his business is low inventory turnover.\r\n\r\nDonald has requested a loan in order to buy more clothing for men and women.

has a stand in the local market where he sells fruits and vegetables. He started the business over 15 years ago after working at a fruit stand with his uncle. With $30 dollars he was able to set up a stand and with money from loan sharks he was able to buy the fruit. He works an early schedule from 5:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m. with the support of his wife.

Mongolia. His oldest daughter is a high school teacher and lives away from her parents. His second-oldest daughter is a college student in Ulaanbaatar, the capital city of Mongolia. Currently, Bat-Orshih lives with his wife and his youngest daughter, who is a local high school student. Bat-Orshih started a small carpentry business in 1990, with just 40,000 MNT of capital ($1 USD=1,500 MNT). He makes wooden furniture, such as chairs, beds, and tables.

This will be Gwen's second loan from SPBD. She successfully repaid a loan of 750 WST that she used to invest in her business.

Her husband originally earned a living from making wine from coconut sap (tuba) which they sold to people around the neighborhood. The couple is blessed with four adult children who are now between 28 and 34 years old, some of whom are gainfully employed and are therefore helping in the support of their family. Lucia hopes that she can continue improving their family's lifestyle through their family's collective hard work.\r\n\r\nAs a wife, Lucia always had a realistic view of their family's situation. She very well knew that the income her husband earned as a tuba maker was just not enough to cover all of their expenses and the increasing need for finances. Because they lived near the sea, Lucia decided that, if she had some capital, she'd engage in the buying and selling of fish to her neighbors and to people in the surrounding villages.\r\n\r\nTo get the necessary access to new capital, Lucia joined NWTF-Project Dungganon, and this enabled them to rent a fishing boat that one of her sons used for fishing, while she continued with her fish-vending venture. With the additional income they were able to buy their own motorized fishing boat soon after. This has enabled them to earn an average monthly income of PHP 8,000.\r\n\r\nHer Credit Record:\r\nLucia\u2019s previous loan of Php 12,000 was utilized as additional capital for her fish-vending business. The loan was fully repaid on time and within the designated loan term without any delays. Now, her 13th loan of Php 14,000 will be used to buy an engine for her fishing boat and to make a few repairs and maintenance work on it. The income from it will be used for the improvement of the family\u2019s living conditions.\r\n\r\nIn the accompanying photo, Lucia is shown with the motorized fishing boat that her son just finished painting.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b> About NWTF:<\/b>\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress out of earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":424207,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fishing","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To

In his 14 year checkered history overseeing his brick-laying and sand-quarry businesses, he has been brought to terms with the requisite virtues that are needed to make successful headway in firmly establishing a business niche. \r\n\r\nA lot of sacrifices have to be made to get that leeway, especially when one is an upstart businessperson. An unwavering sense of purpose, hard work and determination are vital means to achieving one\u2019s ends in any business, according to this affable and buoyant gentleman. He also points out that a belief in one\u2019s abilities is paramount.\r\n\r\nThe vestiges of his first business experience can be traced to his erstwhile diary and still existing retail enterprise. These two businesses were both gotten off their feet with a lot of persuasion from friends. \r\n\r\nIn Bukasa, his sand and brick products are in high demand. This he attributes to the good rapport he has created with his customers. These customers return the favor by bringing in other customers. He says it is mostly middle-class people constructing family homes who are his clients. \r\n\r\nThe happily married father of four says he has made profitable use of his businesses. In a month, his balance sheet profits add to 400,000 shillings. He also still ekes out side profits from his retail shop. Educating all his children to higher institutions of learning is his highest priority for now and the future. With this loan, he is upbeat that he will be in a much stronger financial position to buy more firewood that he requires to bake his bricks.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1375,"image":{"id":568975,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bricks","sector":"Construction","themes":null,"use":"To buy more firewood for baking his bricks","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Mukono","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.25 32.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":84,"posted_date":"2010-07-17T05:00:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1375,"lender_count":38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mukono Edward","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Julius","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ronald","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Robinah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Molly","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Patrick","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bosco","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Margaret","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-06-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":3100000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":1375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":193750},{"due_date":"2010-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":193750},{"due_date":"2010-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":193750},{"due_date":"2010-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":193750},{"due_date":"2010-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":193750},{"due_date":"2010-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":193750},{"due_date":"2010-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":193750},{"due_date":"2010-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":193750},{"due_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","amount":193750},{"due_date":"2010-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":193750},{"due_date":"2010-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":193750},{"due_date":"2010-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":193750},{"due_date":"2010-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":193750},{"due_date":"2010-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":193750},{"due_date":"2010-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":193750},{"due_date":"2010-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":193750}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.94},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.94},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.93},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.94},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.94},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.94},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.93},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.94},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.94},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.94},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.93},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.94},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.94},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":85.94},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":85.93},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":85.94}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":325.28,"local_amount":733350,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:46:59Z","rounded_local_amount":733497.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159689451},{"amount":420.2,"local_amount":947350,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:47:33Z","rounded_local_amount":947541,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166903598},{"amount":371.71,"local_amount":838050,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-16T09:15:32Z","rounded_local_amount":838218.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172297071},{"amount":257.81,"local_amount":581250,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T15:36:09Z","rounded_local_amount":581367.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177467346}],"funded_date":"2010-07-17T11:03:56Z","paid_date":"2010-11-15T15:36:09Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Michelle Archer","image":162079}},{"id":219165,"name":"Wilma","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Wilma T. is a 51-year old widow who supports her family by operating two business ventures:  a lumber yard and a cassava plantation.

Her husband Rolando S., who is 57 years old, works as a laborer to earn his living , and also helps in his wife's business activities.  They have 6 children who are 10 to  23 years old. \r\n\r\nAna Belly joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2002 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 15 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Ana Belly has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of  10,000 PHP helped her earn a monthly profit of  4000 PHP,  uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 16th loan, she is borrowing 13,000 PHP, which she intends to use to buy more stock for her general store so that she can continue to save up for the education of children. Ana Belly S. is a \"Dungganon\" woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed on a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

They live together in Barrio Guanaste in the municipality of San Francisco de la Paz, Olancho.\r\nFor the past 6 years, Elsa has been selling general groceries, and her work hours are 6:00am to 7:00pm. While she runs her business, her two daughters go to school. The advantage of having her own business is that it enables her to have an income to support her small family, which is important because they do not get any help from the father of her daughters. She also does the housework and helps her daughters with their homework.\r\nElsa is requesting a loan because she has been making some improvements to her house and she needs to buy construction materials to plaster the walls and lay a floor. With the help of the loan, she hopes to make her house more attractive for her customers and more comfortable for her daughters. Her goal is to work and strive every day so that her daughters can go to the university and become professionals, something that was not possible for her. This is her 5th year with FAMA and the loans she has had have enabled he to improve her quality of life.

B. is a married woman who lives in Locatha in the village (barangay) of Lo-oc in Lapu-Lapu City, Cebu. She earns her living by operating a sari-sari (general) store. Her husband, Fernando B., who is 62 years old, works as a mechanic to earn his living. They have 7 children between 23 to 40 years old. Three of her children have their own families and the other four have stable work and help her. \r\n\r\nPaterna joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2008 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 6 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Paterna has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 17000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 20000 which improved the family's standard of living. This time, for her 7th loan, she is borrowing PHP 17000, which she intends to use to buy more product to sell so that she can continue to save for the future. Paterna B. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means \"honorable\"). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them \"dungganon,\" a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Kossi was born in 1975 in Gati in the prefecture of Zio. After his primary studies, he obtained a car  driving licence. Not having the means to buy a car, he completed 5 years of farming after that.   Married and father of two children, his wife does not have any income generating activity  -- with the result that all the needs are all supported by Mr A.. From his farming business, the family performs well -- it is responsible for the family's survival. \r\n<br><br>\r\nHe is honest and rigorous,  In order to have his own motor-driven pump, he requests a loan of $1000. He will be able to thus increase the farm's cultivable surface for an increase in its profits. This will be able to thus provide even more suitably for the needs of the family.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nORIGINAL FRENCH\r\n<br><br>\r\nMonsieur A.

N\u2019ayant pas les moyens pour s\u2019acheter une voiture, il fait depuis plus de 5 ans le mara\u00eechage.

A partir de cette activit\u00e9 qu\u2019il ma\u00eetrise si bien et \u00e0 qui il doit sa survie, il assume tant bien que mal les besoins alimentaires des enfants. Honn\u00eate et rigoureux, il a su g\u00e9rer les deux cr\u00e9dits obtenus. Afin d\u2019avoir sa propre motopompe, il sollicite un cr\u00e9dit de $1000. Il pourra ainsi agrandir sa surface cultivable pour une augmentation de ses revenus.

V., 39, is from Brgy Balaring, Silay City, Negros Occidental. She is married to Edwin an auto diesel mechanic. They have two children who are five and 12 years old.  The older child attends school. \r\n\r\nShe dreams to improving her business so she can help her husband earn their livelihood and to send their children to school. In 1990 Ronalyn started making embroidered pillows, bags and other products.  She enjoyed her business and is very skillful in machine embroidery.  As she became known for the quality of her work, her customer-base grew.  It became apparent that she needed more capital to fill orders from her growing clientele. This is why she joined the NWTF Project Dungganon in 2002.  Ronalyn is happy because she is doing something that she loves while earning additional income of at least PHP 2,500 a month.\r\n\r\nRonalyn's Previous loan of Php 19,500 was used as additional capital for her business. Because she used the loan wisely in her business, she was able to pay off her weekly installments on time until she paid the loan in full.  Now for her 15th cycle loan, she wants to borrow another PHP 19,500 so she can continue her embroidery business.\r\n -------------------------------------\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros  Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the  lives of thousands of women through Project  &lt;i&gt;Dungganon&lt;\/i&gt; (a Hiligaynon word that means  &lt;u&gt;Honorable&lt;\/u&gt;). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is  empowering these women to progress out of earning less than $1 a day to  achieving realities that surpass even their dreams.

He is 59 years old, is married and has 5 children, ages 30, 24, 22, 17, and 12.  The two youngest go to school.  Ant\u00f3nio only finished 7th grade; he didn't continue with school because he was drafted into military service. He lives in his own house with his family, and he supports his father by sending him money for household expenses.\r\n\r\nHe left Inhambane for Maputo with his parents when he was 3 years old.  Later, he was drafted into military service in the colonial era.  After his demobilization, he began to work for Mozambique Telecommunications, where he spent more than 25 years of his professional career.  He is currently retired from this company and has a pension of 5,500 MZN per month, which he uses for household expenses and also saves some in his bank account.\r\n\r\nAnt\u00f3nio has never taken out loans from other banks.  He heard about Hluvuku through friends who are also customers of this institution.  This is his fourth loan.  He is asking for 28,000 MZN, with which he wants to buy construction materials (zinc sheets, stone, cement, sand and other items) to continue building his house.  The earlier loans were for 11,200 MZN, 20,000 MZN and 20,000 MZN, all for the same purpose.\r\n\r\nHe promises to pay off this loan on time so he can take out more loans.  In the future, he would like to ask for more loans to finish his home and offer better living conditions to his family.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Danielle Maxson, Kiva

For Habibulo, the harvest is what he enjoys the most and he devotes a lot of time to sorting the vegetables that he will sell because the price will depend on the quality of the crops. \r\n\r\nAgriculture is full of satisfaction for him and his family, even more when they sell for a good price at the market; that is the motivation to continue planting. \r\n\r\nThis is the third loan that Habibulo has had with IMON International.

With the money requested, he will buy seeds, fertilizer, fuels and lubricants for his farm.     \r\n\r\n<b>More about Tajikistan and IMON International<\/b>\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes being a key post along the Silk Road, and for the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition.

(Think about the Future). She makes her home in a simple structure with her four children. She says that her goal is to work and enable her children to have better living conditions. In the meantime she plans to continue cooking different dishes.\r\n\r\nElizabeth is excited to be taking her first loan with Esperanza. She will start her business with this loan. She plans to use it to invest in her new beauty salon, by purchasing a hair dryer and some beauty products. \r\n\r\nThis Esperanza associate began with us because she needed capital to develop her business and increase her household income.

she divorced her husband 34 years ago, all of a sudden Genara faced the responsibility of caring for her five children by herself. As time went on, the sale of clothing she herself made was no longer enough to support her family. For that reason, in 1983, she decided to open a general store. Things were going well, but lack of time forced her to close the business since she needed to take care of her younger children. Because of this she continued making clothing and worked in whatever other business appeared at the time, such as the sale of fish, sale of food, etc.<p>\r\nThree years ago, one of her daughters suggested that she reopen the store. Since she had continued to pay the yearly business license fee to her city, it was no problem to reopen. Because of this, thanks to her daughter\u00b4s support and a loan from EDAPROSPRO, she able to open the store again.<p>\r\nWith a lot of effort, Genera gets ahead in her business. Fortunately her children are grown now and help her once in a while. However, she thinks about growing the business even more because now she needs to take care of two illnesses which she suffers from, diabetes and osteoporosis.<p>\r\n<p><b>Translated from Spanish by Molly Puglisi, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\nCon el divorcio de su esposo, hace treinta y cuatro a\u00f1os, Genara, de pronto, se vio con la responsabilidad de cuidar a sus cinco hijos ella sola. Conforme pasaba  el tiempo, la venta de ropa que ella misma confeccionaba no era suficiente para mantener a su hogar. Por ello, en el a\u00f1o 1983 decidi\u00f3 abrir una bodega. Todo iba yendo bien, pero la falta de tiempo la obligo a cerrar el negocio, pues deb\u00eda ocuparse de atender a sus hijos menores a\u00fan. As\u00ed que contin\u00fao con la confecci\u00f3n de ropas y alguno que otro negocio que se le presentaba en el momento, como la venta de pescados, venta de comidas, etc. <p>\r\nHace tres a\u00f1os, una de sus hijas le propuso volver a abrir la tienda.

Por otro lado considera que lo m\u00e1s dif\u00edcil de su trabajo es tener que permanecer todo el d\u00eda dentro de su tienda, sin poder salir a la calle a realizar otras actividades.

She lives independently in the house that she inherited from her parents and what she desires most is to improve her quality of life.  In the district of Nu\u00f1oa (district of the province of Meglar of the department of Puno), Bersy has her own grocery store. She is very happy with her business since it is very profitable. She has been working in this business for 20 years and what she likes best about it is talking with her customers and finding out what is happening in her neighborhood. On the other hand, what she considers most difficult about her job is having to stay inside her shop all day, without being able to go out on the street to carry out other activities. In the near future she hopes to have a bigger store where she can better attend to her customers and offer them a larger variety of products. For this she knows that she has to work very hard and without rest. This is Bersy\u2019s 9th loan with MFP \u2013 she knows that she has to pay it back on time and she is determined to do so. In her village bank she is very responsible and is always waiting for agreements to be fulfilled between partners. With the 3500 nuevos soles requested, she will buy more products to improve her grocery store.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Kelley Maynard, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1150,"image":{"id":347173,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Increase in merchandise","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Puno","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15.833333 -70.033333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-07-04T20:10:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1150,"lender_count":39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Bersy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-06-09T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":3500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1150}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":1150,"local_amount":3500,"processed_date":"2009-12-07T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T15:21:49Z","rounded_local_amount":3501.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110733976}],"funded_date":"2009-07-23T04:46:14Z","paid_date":"2010-01-15T15:21:49Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kelley Maynard","image":248986}},{"id":124109,"name":"Omoregie","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Omoregie O. is 31 years old.

and has two children.  In search of a consistent income for her children, Shakhlohon became involved in animal husbandry ten years ago.  Thanks to her hard work and persistence, she was able to develop her farm to yield a monthly income of about 15,000 som (KGS) and have four cows and two heifers today.  To find an additional source of profit for her family, entrepreneurial Shakhlohon also started to sell clothing at the local market, and this allows her to cover daily expenses.  To further develop her animal husbandry business, she requested a loan in the sum of 120,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company to purchase cattle.  In the future, Shakhlohon plans to prepare a good dowry for her daughter, thanks to the profits from the loan."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2675,"image":{"id":875656,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

She is grateful to God and her mother for the attention she has received, and for being able to have a normal life. Nothing is impossible for Olivia because she has a well established goal which she is determined to achieve, confronting whatever obstacle which may present itself. Her greatest dream in life is to provide an education and a better quality of life to her son Cristian than that which she received. Her disability is not an obstacle for her to be able to achieve her goal. She works selling catalog beauty products from recognized businesses in Mexico. The way she works is by going door to door offering the products she sells. In this way, she is able to cover the costs of her and her son\u2019s basic necessities. She lives in her mother\u2019s house, along with another brother, and is looking to have her own space in which she and her son will be able to improve their quality of life. For this reason she requests the loan to begin the construction of a room."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":945964,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Property","sector":"Housing","themes":null,"use":"To purchase construction materials.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Acuna","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"29.3 -100.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":18,"posted_date":"2011-12-16T05:00:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Olivia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-12-14T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":5247.54,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":282.31},{"due_date":"2012-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":303.91},{"due_date":"2012-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":327.16},{"due_date":"2012-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":352.19},{"due_date":"2012-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":379.13},{"due_date":"2012-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":408.13},{"due_date":"2012-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":439.35},{"due_date":"2012-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":472.96},{"due_date":"2012-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":509.14},{"due_date":"2012-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":548.09},{"due_date":"2012-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":590.02},{"due_date":"2012-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":635.15}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.52},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.17},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.93},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.85},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.9},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.11},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.49},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.05},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.81},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.78},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.97},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.42}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":21.52,"local_amount":282.31,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-16T09:07:03Z","rounded_local_amount":298.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257392334},{"amount":23.17,"local_amount":303.91,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-17T07:42:52Z","rounded_local_amount":321.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263704742},{"amount":24.93,"local_amount":327.16,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T08:57:30Z","rounded_local_amount":345.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270008966},{"amount":26.85,"local_amount":352.19,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:15:01Z","rounded_local_amount":372.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276618108},{"amount":28.9,"local_amount":379.13,"processed_date":"2012-05-08T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T13:36:37Z","rounded_local_amount":400.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283110030},{"amount":31.11,"local_amount":408.13,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T08:46:09Z","rounded_local_amount":431.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287044510},{"amount":33.49,"local_amount":439.35,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-16T08:33:50Z","rounded_local_amount":464.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294546846},{"amount":36.05,"local_amount":472.96,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:37:26Z","rounded_local_amount":500.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301370153},{"amount":163.11,"local_amount":2139.85,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T08:56:27Z","rounded_local_amount":2262.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308382491},{"amount":10.87,"local_amount":142.55,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-24T09:45:18Z","rounded_local_amount":150.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":332843064}],"funded_date":"2011-12-16T15:33:56Z","paid_date":"2013-01-24T09:45:18Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tim O'Reilly","image":null}},{"id":374949,"name":"Philip","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Philip is a 29-year-old food kiosk owner in Mombasa. \r\n\r\nHe is single and has been operating this business for the past three years and he is doing great.

Although he only has a primary education, he has been able to be successful in cattle ranching and rice cultivation. After working in his father's ranch as a young man, he decided to acquire his own land and start his own family. He has 8 children ages 20, 18, 17, 16, 14, 7, 5 and 1. His older children have already finished their studies and work with him on the ranch while his other kids are still in school. Along with rice cultivation he will also make some investment in cattle with the loan. <\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Ivan is part of the first Communal Bank in the new Mifex Rural Finance Program.  All of the members of the Resistencia Communal Bank are part of an Association of Rice Farmers in Salitre named Resistencia. They will use the microloans to prepare the lands and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each other's guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the Resistencia Association are responsible for the amount that is missing. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many microfinance programs, but is imperative for the communities Mifex works with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties.<\/p>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<h4>Loan Use and Repayment<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The loans in this sector will be used to create water deposits that will prevent flooding in the case of heavy rains or store water in case of droughts. They will also be used to treat the land prior to farming,  to plant the seeds and purchase fertilizer. The loan repayment schedule is also different from the typical microentrepreneur. Because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures, Mifex asks them only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 6 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the seventh and final month. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Below is more information about Salitre compiled by the staff at Mifex when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. <\/em><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>Economy of Salitre<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Salitre is a rural sector in the Province of Guayas known as the capital of Montuvios (montuvio is a cowboy) with approximately 30,000 inhabitants. The main economic activities are herding and agriculture which make up about 80% of the economy. The infrastructure and basic services are poor,  especially the roads and water services.<\/p>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<p>Salitre is highly dedicated to farming rice and cattle ranching. Rice is a crop that yields about every four months. In order to farm rice, the environment must be very humid and there must be a high volume of water. The lack of a structured water system makes it difficult for the small farmers to be highly productive. The best months for cultivating rice are early in the year when it is the rainy season in the coast of Ecuador. <\/p>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<p>Salitre is a national tourist attraction as many Ecuadorians visit the fresh water Salitre River. There are cottages, small restaurants and water attractions that people come to enjoy.<\/p>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<h4>Access to Credit<\/h4>\r\n<p>There is not a single financial institution that provides services to the productive sector of the local economy. The only access to credit comes from loan sharks who charge extremely high interest rates averaging around 20% a month. The locals are also exploited by the intermediaries that buy their products in order to commercialize them in the city and to export abroad. These intermediaries buy crops in advance at very low prices, finance soil at extremely high prices and often provide emergency loans for even higher interest rates than the loan sharks.<\/p>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<h4>Risks<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Salitre is a dangerous sector considering it is in the rural area. There is a high incidence of robbery of cattle that results in many of the ranch owners owning weapons to protect their property. Because the police are not present in these areas, farmers and ranchers must apply their own laws and provide their own security. In some instances they have formed their own cooperatives and associations to have a community crime prevention effort.<\/p>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<p>Salitre is in the lowlands of Ecuador and is vulnerable to flooding in the rainy season. In the event of a heavy rainy season, often at its worse when El Ni\u00f1o occurs, the farmers of rice lose many of their crops. All this is due to a lack of infrastructure in the area.<\/p>\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":17103,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Invest

She is a farmer in the village of Glahounsa in the valley of the Ou\u00e9m\u00e9 River and is a member of the group GM Senablo of Glahounsa.<P>\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of this village work as farmers when the river level is low. Their land is rich and gives them a good harvest. Their principal crops are maize (corn), hot peppers, vegetables, okra, tomatoes, and manioc which are staple foods in Benin. The problem for these people who dwell along the river is that when the river is in flood, they have no more work and spend all the money they earned during the last farming season on foodstuffs. When the waters recede, they have no money left to pay for laborers who are indispensible to them in sowing their land.<P>\r\n\r\nThe custom of borrowing against the new harvest does not make them more secure and indeed leaves them worse off. They sell their future harvest at a laughable price to weathier persons so that they have the cash needed to do their farming. Weary of this practice, C\u00e9line S. A. has requested a loan of 100,000 F CFA which will allow her to farm about 1 hectare, growing some of the aforementioned crops.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Teresa Kramer, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":237880,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"cultivating 1 hectare in maize (corn) and hot peppers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BJ","country":"Benin","town":"Porto-Novo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"6.483333 2.616667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":104,"posted_date":"2008-12-11T18:30:16Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":200,"lender_count":4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"C\u00e9line","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-12-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":100000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2009-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2009-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2009-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2009-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2009-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2009-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2009-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":12500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":25,"local_amount":12500,"processed_date":"2009-01-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T09:37:34Z","rounded_local_amount":12900.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14821560},{"amount":25,"local_amount":12500,"processed_date":"2009-02-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-15T08:37:24Z","rounded_local_amount":12900.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20357826},{"amount":25,"local_amount":12500,"processed_date":"2009-03-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T09:31:36Z","rounded_local_amount":12900.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27046876},{"amount":25,"local_amount":12500,"processed_date":"2009-04-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T10:18:14Z","rounded_local_amount":12900.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35938494},{"amount":50,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T20:49:04Z","rounded_local_amount":25800.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44396160},{"amount":25,"local_amount":12500,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T17:07:34Z","rounded_local_amount":12900.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52904037},{"amount":25,"local_amount":12500,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T10:25:51Z","rounded_local_amount":12900.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63126045}],"funded_date":"2008-12-11T23:21:28Z","paid_date":"2009-08-15T10:25:51Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":83165,"name":"Alaine","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Alaine S., 19, is single with  children.

For societal reasons (his parents' extreme poverty), he decided to drop out of school (at age 15) to earn an income in order to help his parents provide for the family.  After several years of all kinds of commerce, he decided in the end to get settled in selling various shop goods in his district.  With his four years of experience, he has a good command of his business. \r\n\r\nTo expand his working capital, he decided to collaborate with Soro Yiriwaso and is on his first individual loan.  He intends to buy various shop goods in Bamako (capital of Mali) from wholesalers.  And he'll make his sales to a rich and varied customer base out of his shop located in Massablacoura. \r\n\r\nWith this loan, he hopes to realize a monthly profit of 25,000 francs CFA for expanding his shop and for meeting the needs of the family.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva

Tambi\u00e9n se dedica a la crianza y venta de carneros y cuyes y paralelamente realiza todo tipo de artesan\u00edas, entre alfombras, telares, chompas, etc. En esta actividad tambi\u00e9n ocupa bastante tiempo, porque le gusta y aprendi\u00f3 desde muy joven.\nDesde entonces, esta actividad tambi\u00e9n le genera buenas ganancias y le gusta mucho, ya que hace hermosos telares de distintos colores y texturas.\nPara el futuro tiene pensado sembrar en mayor cantidad y migrar de la zona donde vive para probar suerte en otras tierras donde tiene familiares, pero continuar con la agricultura.\n\nEste es el primer pr\u00e9stamo que tiene con MFP y est\u00e1 seguro que cumplir\u00e1 con cada pago porque quiere pedir otros cr\u00e9ditos para seguir adelante con todos sus sue\u00f1os. El dinero que solicita lo invertir\u00e1 en la compra de abono y fertilizantes para dar el tratamiento adecuado a sus tierras, y tambi\u00e9n adquirir\u00e1 m\u00e1s carneros y cuyes para seguir con su negocio.","en":"Fortunato is 54 years old and lives with his wife Lidia, age 52, and their youngest two sons, who are twins: Juber and Jhonny, both age 16. The rest of their sons are married and have their own families.\r\n\r\nThis cheerful man can be described as \"multi-functional\", as he currently works in various trades and is very dedicated to each. He began in farming, which still occupies a large part of his time today, growing potatoes, barley, and peas, which turn a good profit. His twin sons help him with the farming, but only when they have time, since they are still in school. Fortunato also raises and sells rams and guinea pigs, and produces different types of textiles including carpets, weavings, sweaters, etc. This work also occupies a lot of his time, because he learned to create woven products when he was very young and likes the work.\r\n\r\nSince then, this work has also generated good income and he really enjoys making beautiful weavings that have distinctive colors and textures. In the future he plans to plant greater quantities and move away from where he currently lives to try his luck farming in a different region where he has relatives.\r\n\r\nThis is his first loan from MFP and Fortunato is sure he will make each payment because he wants to qualify for future loans to continue progress toward his dreams. The money he is requesting will be invested in the purchase of manure and fertilizers to properly cultivate his crops. He will also acquire more rams and guinea pigs to continue his business.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Vivian Lu, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":458576,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Purchase of manure and fertilizers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-12-27T07:30:15Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":700,"lender_count":27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Fortunato","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-12-03T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":128.77},{"due_date":"2010-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":139.35},{"due_date":"2010-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":144.93},{"due_date":"2010-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":148.57},{"due_date":"2010-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":158.62},{"due_date":"2010-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":163.01},{"due_date":"2010-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":166.5},{"due_date":"2010-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":177.48},{"due_date":"2010-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":182.24},{"due_date":"2010-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":189.78},{"due_date":"2010-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":198.17},{"due_date":"2010-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":202.58}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.07},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.77},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.73},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.51},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.06},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.27},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.12},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.78},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.43},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":69.36},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.9}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":45.07,"local_amount":128.77,"processed_date":"2010-01-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:10:12Z","rounded_local_amount":129.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118124388},{"amount":48.77,"local_amount":139.35,"processed_date":"2010-02-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:48:40Z","rounded_local_amount":140.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123960129},{"amount":50.73,"local_amount":144.93,"processed_date":"2010-03-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:32:33Z","rounded_local_amount":146.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128992973},{"amount":52,"local_amount":148.57,"processed_date":"2010-04-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:37:07Z","rounded_local_amount":149.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136717759},{"amount":55.51,"local_amount":158.62,"processed_date":"2010-05-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:39:11Z","rounded_local_amount":160,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144751435},{"amount":57.06,"local_amount":163.01,"processed_date":"2010-06-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:02:26Z","rounded_local_amount":164.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151933883},{"amount":58.27,"local_amount":166.5,"processed_date":"2010-07-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:36:24Z","rounded_local_amount":167.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159672773},{"amount":62.12,"local_amount":177.48,"processed_date":"2010-08-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:39:11Z","rounded_local_amount":179.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166886633},{"amount":63.78,"local_amount":182.24,"processed_date":"2010-09-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:25:02Z","rounded_local_amount":183.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172153779},{"amount":66.43,"local_amount":189.78,"processed_date":"2010-10-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T15:13:11Z","rounded_local_amount":191.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177449188},{"amount":140.26,"local_amount":400.75,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:01:37Z","rounded_local_amount":404.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182587950}],"funded_date":"2009-12-27T15:35:01Z","paid_date":"2010-12-15T15:01:37Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Vivian Lu","image":225936}},{"id":169479,"name":"Claudia Del Socorro","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La  Se\u00f1ora Claudia del Socorro M.

She has her hand raised in the photograph, she is a client of the sixteenth cycle, and she is 37 years old, married, and mother of 5 children all of whom attend school. Her husband has a small business, a pharmacy at Butembo, a commercial town situated in the Lubero territory which is over 410 kilometres from Goma\r\nJeannine Kabuo Tahirana sells second hand shoes at the central market of Virunga,she set up  her small business with her own money ,a sum of about 50$ that she received from her husband. At that time she was selling fritters. After the eruption of the Nyiragongo volcano from the 16th to the 17th of February 2002 which completely destroyed the economy and the basic infrastructure of the town of Goma, and of which she was one of the victims, she decided to change her activity and sell second hand shoes. She has been doing this for 8 years. With the loan from the IMF Hekima, Jeannine Kabuo Tahirana hopes to increase her turnover by buying 75 pairs of used shoes .The main challenge of this activity is that the sale of merchandise (buying of shoes) depends on the availability of money (the revenue of the population).In addition the competition of shoes made in Uganda\/Kampala disrupts the prices.\r\nJeannine Kabuo Tahirana also practises small artisan activities, she weaves carpets to increase her income. In 10 years time, she hopes to become a wholesaler and no longer a small retailer. She aims to obtain her stock from the big commercial centre in either Kampala or Butembo.\r\nIn addition, Jeannine Kabuo Tahirana is a tenant, she would like to buy a piece of land and build on it since her husband works a long way away from her, and this would allow her to reduce the burden of the family expenses.\r\nJeannine Kabuo Tahirana is grateful to the IMF Hekima for the loans that she receives without any physical security ,for thanks to these loans she can manage to provide for her children. This Twende Mbele group is made up of 14 women members one of whom is ill (J. Matunda) and E. Kavira who are not on the group photograph, which is why there are only 12 clients on the photograph.\r\n       \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Barbara Belli, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4650,"image":{"id":592478,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Shoe Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":["Conflict Zones"],"use":"purchase of 75 pairs of used shoes ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CD","country":"Congo (Dem.

She did so  primarily to help her grow her sari-sari store. She opted to purchase rice, assorted groceries, and soft drinks. Also, she plans to buy an additional computer for her computer shop and some computer software.\r\n\r\nEmily takes it a personal challenge to keep going on with her business and unceasingly pray for its growth. Nevertheless, she knows that with the Lord by her side there is nothing to worry about. She intends to save her profits and invest in another business in preparation for the future of her family because for her, success is something you don\u2019t simply wait for; you have to make it happen.\r\n\r\nAs a CCT community partner, she faithfully attends their group's weekly fellowship* meeting where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she has received.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":710801,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, and Central Asian traditions. <p>\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Vasquez and Mercedes del Carmen Hernandez Orozco. The solidarity group Karla is from the locality of Las Flores, city of Masaya. Their businesses are the making of clothing, shoes and a beauty salon. They are well known and trusted in the community, they are young women with a lot of drive and the desire to work and improve themselves. They like to work with Adim because they receive training in how to improve their businesses. Mrs. Nancy makes clothes; she has a small workshop in her home where she makes aprons, school shirts and tablecloths. She has a small child, and started her business to generate more income and help with expenses. Her husband works in a textile company, which is what gave her the idea for the business. Mrs. Mercedes del Carmen makes woman's shoes, she has two workers, her workshop is in her home. With credit she purchased glue, leather, and plastic to design her sandals. She hopes to improve her workshop and make it weather-proof, since presently she cannot work when it rains, as it is out in the open. Ms. Karla de los Angeles has a small beauty salon in her home, very good clients, and needs the loan to buy cosmetics for use in her shop. She was selected the group's coordinator, responsible for collecting the payments and dropping them off at the Adim office. She dreams to improve her beauty salon, purchase more mirrors and provide a better atmosphere to the place. Her husband works at a chicken processing factory and helps with the household expenses; she has three school-age children, and this business has helped her provide for her children immensely.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Monica Hayden, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":307952,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty Salon","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"comprar cosm\u00e9ticos como tintes, cremas para peinar, geltinas para el pelo, colores para peinar, etc. Tambien compra pinturas como : maquillajes, cremas limpiadoras, sombras y lapices labiales, pinturas de u\u00f1as, etc., estos tambien se los ofrece a los clientes","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Masaya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.966667 -86.1","type":"point"}},"partner_id":120,"posted_date":"2009-04-23T20:30:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":475,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Karla De Los Angeles","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nancy Mercedes","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mercedes Del Carmen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-04-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":9500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1187.5},{"due_date":"2009-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":1187.5},{"due_date":"2009-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1187.5},{"due_date":"2009-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":1187.5},{"due_date":"2009-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1187.5},{"due_date":"2009-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1187.5},{"due_date":"2009-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1187.5},{"due_date":"2009-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1187.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.38},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.37},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.38},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.37},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.38},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.37},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.38},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.37}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":59.37,"local_amount":1187.5,"processed_date":"2009-04-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T09:35:01Z","rounded_local_amount":1195.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35927275},{"amount":59.38,"local_amount":1187.5,"processed_date":"2009-05-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T20:17:45Z","rounded_local_amount":1195.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44382449},{"amount":59.38,"local_amount":1187.5,"processed_date":"2009-05-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T20:18:07Z","rounded_local_amount":1195.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44382450},{"amount":175.93,"local_amount":3518.6,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T16:20:14Z","rounded_local_amount":3543.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52889204},{"amount":2.2,"local_amount":43.9,"processed_date":"2009-07-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T09:26:15Z","rounded_local_amount":44.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63110532},{"amount":59.4,"local_amount":1187.5,"processed_date":"2009-07-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T09:27:01Z","rounded_local_amount":1195.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63110533},{"amount":59.34,"local_amount":1187.5,"processed_date":"2009-08-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T09:31:35Z","rounded_local_amount":1195.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73531968}],"funded_date":"2009-04-23T23:21:15Z","paid_date":"2009-09-15T09:31:35Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Monica Hayden","image":170539}},{"id":107757,"name":"Selestina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mambo from Tanzania!

She works 13 hours per day, 7 days per week and is assisted by one employee. She is requesting a loan of $400 to purchase more drinks so she can expand her business and service more customers. Selestina thanks you for her support!\r\n\r\nABOUT SELFINA\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":318114,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Liquor Store \/ Off-License","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To purchase more drinks","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mwanza","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.516667 32.9","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-05-12T23:50:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Selestina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-05-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":45454.55},{"due_date":"2009-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":45454.55},{"due_date":"2009-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":45454.55},{"due_date":"2009-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":45454.55},{"due_date":"2009-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":45454.55},{"due_date":"2009-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":45454.55},{"due_date":"2009-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":45454.55},{"due_date":"2010-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":45454.55},{"due_date":"2010-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":45454.55},{"due_date":"2010-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":45454.55},{"due_date":"2010-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":45454.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.36},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.36},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.36},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.36},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.36},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.36},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.36},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.36},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.36},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.36},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.4}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":36.36,"local_amount":45454.55,"processed_date":"2009-06-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:02:32Z","rounded_local_amount":48058.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010851},{"amount":36.36,"local_amount":45454.55,"processed_date":"2009-07-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:39:19Z","rounded_local_amount":48058.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63233137},{"amount":36.36,"local_amount":45454.55,"processed_date":"2009-08-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:52:54Z","rounded_local_amount":48058.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73664928},{"amount":36.36,"local_amount":45454.55,"processed_date":"2009-09-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T02:46:45Z","rounded_local_amount":48058.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87105640},{"amount":36.36,"local_amount":45454.55,"processed_date":"2009-10-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T06:27:39Z","rounded_local_amount":48058.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97022750},{"amount":36.36,"local_amount":45454.55,"processed_date":"2009-11-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:41:51Z","rounded_local_amount":48058.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103867988},{"amount":36.36,"local_amount":45454.55,"processed_date":"2009-12-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T16:44:45Z","rounded_local_amount":48058.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110757189},{"amount":36.36,"local_amount":45454.55,"processed_date":"2010-01-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:34:29Z","rounded_local_amount":48058.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118146301},{"amount":36.36,"local_amount":45454.55,"processed_date":"2010-02-21T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T11:15:55Z","rounded_local_amount":48058.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123984463},{"amount":36.36,"local_amount":45454.55,"processed_date":"2010-03-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-10T13:00:48Z","rounded_local_amount":48058.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":129015149},{"amount":36.4,"local_amount":45454.5,"processed_date":"2010-04-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-10T13:02:26Z","rounded_local_amount":48058.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136740166}],"funded_date":"2009-05-14T13:46:09Z","paid_date":"2010-12-10T13:02:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Barbara Barg","image":null}},{"id":111853,"name":"Galina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Galina is a small entrepreneur from Drogobych.
