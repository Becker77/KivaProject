She and her husband work together making and selling charcoal.

He is very dedicated to his work and maintains frequent contact via cellphone with the parents of the children he transports, and with the schoolteachers, since he is not only responsible for transporting students but also for informing parents of school events and meetings. The cellphone is also one of the most secure ways to contact him directly when someone wants to hire his services.\r\nJorge is requesting a loan from Integral to buy some spare parts for his vehicle, and to provide all necessary maintenance to his vehicle.

She makes adult sports clothes, which she hopes to watch grow into a large company.  Since 2006, she studied design, cut, and tailoring at a technical college.  In 2008, after investigating her idea, she started her own business, purchasing a domestic sewing machine and beginning her work in her tiny apartment.  With discipline and responsibility, her capital began increasing little by little until she owned 5 semi-industrial sewing machines and dominated her neighborhood's market, keeping in mind that there is a lot of competition from other nearby workshops.  Currently, she is seeking her first financial loan with the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, an organization that she felt encouraged to join for their available services.  She wants to add an industrial sewing machine in order to improve the finishing on her pieces and their production time.  Her dream is to expand her workshop and to offer a selection of products that capture the attention of potential clients located in other areas of her locality that have yet to know about her business.  Her main challenge has been winning her sector's market since she is surrounded by three other workshops.  Nonetheless, she is situated in front of an important shopping center, where there are accessible means of reaching her business and serve as a strategic point for its growth.

She earns her living by operating 2 business ventures:  Farming and buying and selling rice. Her husband Nestor F. is 55 years old.  He works as a driver to earn his living and also helps in his wife's business activities.  They have 3 children between 26 and 32 years old.  One child has a family and the other 2 are working. \r\n\r\nElisa joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2002 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 17 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Elisa has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 15000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 4000, improving the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 18th loan, she is borrowing PHP 15000, which she intends to use to funds for her business operations so that she can continue to save up for the future. Elisa is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through its programs, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

With the help of her past nine loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Rosalinda has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 10,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 10,000, uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her 10th loan, she is borrowing PHP 12,000 to pay for an additional game unit and stock for her general store so that she can continue to save up for a future business expansion.

They have 30 quintals of coffee, orange trees, lemons, and avocados planted on 5 hectares.\r\n\r\nThis activity allowed them to save up the necessary capital to buy a small truck, which one of their older sons drives.  They provide freight services with this vehicle and move the harvests, most of the time crates of fruit, for their neighbors in town.

","en":"Shavkat has been involved in animal husbandry for over ten years, with the goal of increasing livestock headcount.  He spent several years working in Russia, and earning that money was not easy.  He returned home and got involved in animal husbandry right away.  Shavkat used his earnings to purchase eight heads of sheep and two heads of cattle and was able to increase livestock headcount over the years like this.  Currently, he has forty heads of sheep and six heads of cattle.  Today, he needs to expand the barn for his livestock because it will not fit there in the winter.  If Shavkat does not build a barn for the livestock, then he would have to sell some of the sheep, which would not be economical, since he is buying sheep at low prices now.  Shavkat is requesting a loan in the sum of 7000 Somoni to purchase construction materials to build a barn, and to use the rest of the money to purchase sheep and fodder for it.

Her three children, who were still young at the time, were the ones who motivated her to start her business. Thanks to a friend she was able to obtain the start-up capital to begin working, and she hasn't stopped since.\r\n\r\nShe used to work in people's houses, cleaning and doing laundry, but she left that work because she didn't have anyone to take care of her children, since she is a single mother.\r\n\r\nNow that she is 48 years old and her children are grown-up and independent, she not only sells fish but also prickly pears when they're in season. In the future she is thinking about selling food in her own home on the weekends, hoping to have work that is more stable and not as damaging to her physical health. She would also like to have a store, but that will require a larger investment and she must make sure the financial risk is worth it.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Andrea Rosenberg, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":150,"image":{"id":264394,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish Selling","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Buy food to sell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":93,"posted_date":"2009-01-31T22:00:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":150,"lender_count":2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Bacilia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-09T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":135,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2009-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2009-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":45}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":81.11,"local_amount":73,"processed_date":"2009-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T08:06:28Z","rounded_local_amount":81.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20393196},{"amount":18.89,"local_amount":17,"processed_date":"2009-03-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T17:46:38Z","rounded_local_amount":18.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27084886},{"amount":50,"local_amount":45,"processed_date":"2009-04-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-29T08:16:27Z","rounded_local_amount":50,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35978350}],"funded_date":"2009-01-31T22:04:57Z","paid_date":"2009-05-29T08:16:27Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Andrea Rosenberg","image":603074}},{"id":91001,"name":"Nolasco","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"\nInvirti\u00f3 para aumentar la mercanc\u00eda de su tienda.\nA sus sesenta y un a\u00f1os, Nolasco tiene a cargo el negocio que sustenta la familia, un hijo todav\u00eda menor de edad, y a su esposa inv\u00e1lida. \nNolasco dedic\u00f3 casi toda su vida a trabajos en diferentes empresas, como personal de limpieza principalmente, trabajo en el cual reci\u00e9n, en enero de este a\u00f1o, logr\u00f3 jubilarse y conseguir una pensi\u00f3n que lo ayude ahora a cubrir los gastos del hogar y de su familia.\nHace seis a\u00f1os su esposa perdi\u00f3 sus piernas, as\u00ed que el tuvo que encontrar una manera de trabajar y poder cuidar de ella a la misma vez.

Triunfaremos\" (We Will Succeed with Effort), are requesting their second loan since they've been clients of Esperanza International. This group of entrepreneurs lives in Consuelo, an area of San Pedro de Macoris known for being the hometown of baseball stars like Sammy Sosa. Consuelo was established around a sugar cane factory that is no longer operating. This has brought serious unemployment and left many acres of State-property land that are not being used right now because no one is planting on them after the sugar cane industry collapse. This has forced many people to become self-employed and set up their own businesses. \r\n<p>\r\nRoxana O. is the group representative and has a miscellaneous store.

For the last four years she has operated a store from her home and, little by little, and with the help of loans from EDAPROSPO, she has improved both her economic and personal status. She will invest the majority of the loan of S\/ 1,000.00 [approximately US $340] to further supply her store and, with any leftover money, will improve her home.\n\nThe Alcom las Violetas is comprised of 10 members, is in its third cycle, and has until now spent a total amount of S\/ 8,400.00. Each member is dedicated to a different activity such as the sale of CDs, orange juice and candy, among others. They are very punctual and responsible clients that help each other out and do not allow any individual member to fail.

After she separated from her husband, she dedicated herself to taking care of her two children who were young at the time.  They live together in a house that took much effort to build.  Elena always had an interest in having her own business and so she worked as a traveling saleslady for several years.  Over time, she saved enough money to buy some products to open a grocery store from her home.  The children help with the business.  \r\n<p>\r\nShe works from 6pm to midnight, since demand in her area is greater at night.  Her business has to be well-stocked with a diversified line of products.  The grocery has been in operation for 5 years, thanks to the support of the children.  Elena hopes the investment she has made is worthwhile, because she has ambitions of expanding her shop and opening a bazaar where one can find a variety of products frequently requested by her customers.  \r\n<p>\r\nThis is her eighth loan with Microfinanzas PRISMA and she thanks her communal bank group for utilizing the power of its social network and demanding cooperation among the members.  Her loan of 2000 soles will be used to buy groceries and other new products that she would like to introduce into her business.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":356158,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Increase her inventory of merchandise","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-07-22T03:10:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":675,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":301.71},{"due_date":"2009-08-31T07:00:00Z","amount":307.03},{"due_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":326.04},{"due_date":"2009-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":340.72},{"due_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":354.94},{"due_date":"2009-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":369.56}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":101.83},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":103.62},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110.04},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":114.99},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":119.79},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":124.73}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":101.83,"local_amount":301.71,"processed_date":"2009-07-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:46:09Z","rounded_local_amount":309.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63212057},{"amount":103.62,"local_amount":307.03,"processed_date":"2009-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:30:24Z","rounded_local_amount":314.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73641598},{"amount":110.04,"local_amount":326.04,"processed_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:42:17Z","rounded_local_amount":333.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87081038},{"amount":114.99,"local_amount":340.72,"processed_date":"2009-10-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:17:01Z","rounded_local_amount":349,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96997188},{"amount":119.79,"local_amount":354.94,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:56:33Z","rounded_local_amount":363.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103842532},{"amount":124.73,"local_amount":369.56,"processed_date":"2009-12-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T15:24:08Z","rounded_local_amount":378.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734108}],"funded_date":"2009-07-22T05:05:53Z","paid_date":"2010-01-15T15:24:08Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ronan Reodica","image":498323}},{"id":127867,"name":"Buligo United Nabatazi Shifa Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"N.

For the past 2 years she has dedicated her professional career to the sale of fuel like petroleum, gasoline, and kerosene. Her business is known for selling unadulterated fuel, and for this she earns about 280 Soles per day in profits. For supplies, Laxmi travels every three days to the location where the tap is located that provides said fuel at the lowest price, and in this way she is able to sell it at a modest price. Because of this all of her clients prefer doing business with her. Laxmi is very content with her business, and even more because her husband primes the cylinders for the fuel in an appropriate location so that she does not have to bear so much weight and so that she does not contaminate her children. In the past her loans were under her husband's name, but she attended all of the meetings of the community bank and because of this decided to change the ownership of the loan and Laxmi feels very much a part of the group. Futhermore, she is the treasurer and she is in charge of the monthly collections. The money that she is requesting she will invest in the purchase of cylinders and more fuel. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Amy Schapiro, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":875,"image":{"id":386360,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fuel\/Firewood","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Increasing her commodities and purchasing cylinders","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Chanchamayo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.05 -75.316667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-09-10T16:50:12Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":875,"lender_count":26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Laxmi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-08-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":875,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":2500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":875}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":875,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2010-04-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:37:15Z","rounded_local_amount":2563.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136717251}],"funded_date":"2009-09-11T12:26:58Z","paid_date":"2010-05-15T11:37:15Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Amy Schapiro","image":null}},{"id":140214,"name":"Justus","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Justus is 27 years old.

Her name is Cirila G.. She lives in Yulo\u2019s Park, Brgy 14, Bacolod City, Negros Occidental. She is 53 years old and is married to Rogelio G. who helps her in running their business. The couple is blessed with three adult children and some of them have their own families already.  Cirila is happy to have three grandchildren.\r\n\r\nBecause she had the knowledge and skills to make \u201cBibingka\u201d, a native Ilonggo delicacy that is made with rice flour, coconut milk, sugar and young coconut strips cooked in a top-fired oven, she started this business in 1996 with the help of her husband. They set up a cart with a specially made \"bibingka\" oven that enabled them to make and sell hot \"bibingka\" in different places that have high foot traffic. On Sundays, they setup their mobile \"bibingka\" bakery in front of the cathedral where Sunday mass goers could buy their product when they come out of the church after attending mass. On weekdays, they setup in front of schools with high student population. \r\n\r\nIn 2005, she joined NWTF-Project Dungganon to gain access to additional capital for her business. Because of the additional capital, she was able to improve her business income so that on the 3rd cycle, she decided to invest her loan not on her \"bibingka\" business but instead invest it in a backyard pig-fattening venture. This gave her a good return on her business after three to four months when she sold the pigs, enabling her to increase her income even further. The two ventures give her a combined average income of PHP 3,000 per week, which pays for their household expenses and school expenses, with some left over for savings.\r\n\r\nCirila is happy that her husband and children also help out in her business. For one week this October, they have setup their mobile store at the Bacolod Public Plaza because of the high pedestrian traffic in the area when Bacolod City celebrates its weeklong \"Masskara\" Festival. Cirila's \"Bibingka\" has gathered many regular customers and she has started receiving advance orders.\r\n\r\nFor her previous loan, she borrowed Php 27,000, which she used as additional capital for her business and it was fully paid on time and in full within her loan term. Now she is borrowing for her 12th cycle, a loan of Php 29,500 to be used as additional working capital for her business. The income from it will be be used to improve the living conditions of her family and some will be set aside as savings for future emergencies.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the calling of not just a few but thousands of women. Through the alleviation program, these women have progressed from earning less than a measly $1 a day, to surpassing the realities beyond their dreams. They have learned to live a life where they can finally be called honorable. This is Project Dungganon. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":405566,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

Other borrowers make handicrafts or work in repairing broken household items, dressmaking, and weaving.  Some borrowers work in sales, selling food, clothing, and maintaining their grocery shops.\n \nThis group's objective is to grow in their respective businesses and reach their goals, while promoting their quality products.

She will use this loan to purchase more materials for her artisan work in order to expand the diversity of her products.\n\nThe experience that they have had with Fondo Esperanza, according to Jocelyn, has surpassed the group's expectations. Beyond giving them the tools they need to meet their businesses' needs, they have felt an unparalleled quality of people among the group's members and they have found this very gratifying.\n\nThe Chilean province of Talca is located in the Maule region of central Chile. Maule has the largest rural population of any of Chile's 15 regions.  Its citizens typically work in farming and agriculture.  Talca is known for its beautiful artisan work, colonial architecture, vineyards, and scenery.  \n

Evelyn has been engaged in her business for over 12 years and earns approximately 4,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Evelyn joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Evelyn has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Evelyn is requesting a new loan of 6,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase new items to expand her product offering. This loan will be the second loan taken out by Evelyn from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 29 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Her daughter helps her to make the decorations for important celebrations because detail work on Styrofoam is difficult to do alone.

Her husband, Jumabek, is a pensioner and helps her in the household. Four years ago, in order to find means of subsistence and to make some savings for old age, Narynkul decided to engage in cattle breeding. \r\n\r\nUsing her starting capital of only 2,000 KGS, Narynkul decided to start her business in cattle breeding and bought bull calves. She concentrated all her efforts on supporting and expanding her household and managed to raise her capital to 40,000 KGS.  Now, Narynkul wants to take out a loan of 70,000 KGS to buy three bull-calves and four sheep for fattening and reselling. With the revenues from this investment, Narynkul plans to develop her farm by means of livestock breeding. In the future, she dreams to open a small shop with meat products. \r\n\r\nBai-Tushum and Partners uses Kiva funding to target the especially vulnerable population.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from raising pigs for fattening and sale. Marites has been engaged in her business for over six years and earns approximately 5,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Marites joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Marites has successfully repaid a previous loan of 12,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase breeding livestock. Marites is requesting a new loan of 12000 PHP which will be used to purchase baby livestock to raise and sell in the future. This loan will be the 7th loan taken out by Marites from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand the business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines.

Shahlo is 37 years old. She is married and the loving mother of three children. In order to help her husband support their large family, she started her own business. So, for the last five years, she has been selling curtains.\r\n\r\nShahlo has her own trading place that is located in one of the local markets. Being by nature a very friendly and polite person, she obtained her clientele very soon. The business is stable and is generating the main income for the family.\r\n\r\nToday, Shahlo is planning to increase her working capital in order to expand her business. She needs additional funds to purchase new items of curtains to sell. For this purpose Shahlo requests 3,000 USD.\r\n\r\nShahlo has already received a previous loan from IMON and has proved herself a reliable client. She thanks all for their support and promises to be accurate in her loan repayment.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>More about Tajikistan and IMON International<\/b>\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He also recently started selling items such as fine sand, coarse sand, stones, and other such items.\r\nHe tells us that it has been going very well for him, so he plans to invest more in order to get the most out of his business. He belongs to the \"El Vencedor\" [\"The Victor\"] communal bank, and this is his first loan with MFP. He is grateful for the support that he is receiving; it will allow him to progress with his business. He also promises to be punctual with the payment of his quotas. His bank is made up of responsible and united people.

She owns a business venture, selling pancakes (fried flour pancakes flavored with lemon or coconut jam).  Sapi has 3 years of experience in this business.  Sapi needs a loan of WST $1000 to buy flour, flavoring, sugar, and plastic bags.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 400 talas or US $167 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Sapi joined SPBD.  This is her 1st loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Sapi's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Sapi T. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.8 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              2 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         2 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

With these different types of dishes, Florence will hopefully earn more profits which in turn will allow her to keep reinvesting for better financial stability and continue building a secure future for her family.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":875,"image":{"id":628690,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Products Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"the purchase of various dishes for sale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"RW","country":"Rwanda","town":"Kigali","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-1.953611 30.060556","type":"point"}},"partner_id":117,"posted_date":"2010-10-30T14:10:11Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":875,"lender_count":29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Florence","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-10-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"RWF","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":875,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-12-27T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2011-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2011-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2011-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2011-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2011-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2011-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2011-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:50:27Z","rounded_local_amount":50575,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182623159},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T14:56:01Z","rounded_local_amount":50575,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188760980},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T05:58:15Z","rounded_local_amount":50575,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191497904},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T12:26:28Z","rounded_local_amount":50575,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195926193},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T12:21:21Z","rounded_local_amount":50575,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201368100},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:54:39Z","rounded_local_amount":50575,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206233106},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T12:08:39Z","rounded_local_amount":50575,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211308392},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:59:39Z","rounded_local_amount":50575,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216587296},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T09:36:04Z","rounded_local_amount":50575,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221756483},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T10:32:25Z","rounded_local_amount":50575,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227124836}],"funded_date":"2010-10-30T15:34:57Z","paid_date":"2011-09-15T10:32:25Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":247580,"name":"Teofilo Alfredo","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Te\u00f3filo de 43 a\u00f1os, vive en una zona periurbana llamada Para\u00edso de la flor ubicada en una zona caracterizada por sus caminos de tierra y monta\u00f1as.

She buys the maize from the farmers and sell it in town. \r\n\r\nShe works at her business for 12 hours per day, 6 days per week. Lusajo currently earns about $200 USD each month from her business.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":288043,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To purchase more maize in bulk","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbeya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.9 33.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-03-16T03:50:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":625,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lusajo M.

This is 27-year-old Agness M. from Mbeya. She is married with one 7-year-old child. Additionally, she is responsible for supporting one orphaned dependent. \r\n\r\nAgness has been running a beauty salon business since 2002. Her business is the place where her friends and fellow women can gather and literally let their hair down.  Most beauty salons in Tanzania are places where you can buy long hair, short hair, curly hair, straight hair, red hair, blue hair, and then have it attached to your head, woven, cut, or braided, and made to look like your own.\r\n\r\nShe works at the business for 9-12 hours per day, six days per week and is assisted by one employee. Agness currently earns about 90 USD a month from her business. She is requesting a loan in order to expand her salon. In the future, she plans to open another salon. Agness thanks you for your support!\r\n\r\nABOUT SELFINA:\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.

Her husband\u2019s salary is being saved for the education of their child and for their future as a whole family.\r\n\r\nGina engaged herself in her retailing business hoping to help her husband in gaining income to support their daily needs. Gina wants to ask for a loan of PHP 5,000 to further expand her business. She\u2019s always wanted to grow it with her own ability. Her future plan for the loan is to purchase additional products like rice to sell to increase her

She owns a business venture, selling pancakes (fried flour pancakes flavored with lemon or coconut jam).  Christina has 1 year of experience in this business.  Christina needs a loan of WST $1000 to buy flour, flavoring, sugar, and plastic bags.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 300 talas or US $125 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Christina joined SPBD.  This is her 1st loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Christina's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Christina T. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.87 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              2 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         2 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

Jovelyn is just starting this business.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Jovelyn joined Kiva partner HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Jovelyn is requesting a first loan of 4,000 PHP which will be used to invest in expanding the business.

Sohibjon is 41 years old, married, and has two children. He sells cattle and, as a rule, purchases small cattle in the central market, feeds them, and than resells them at higher prices in the local market. Having been in this business for ten years, Sohibjon knows very well how to choose the animals, breed them and look after them. He gets up early every morning in order to feed the animals and look after them. His knowledge and skills allow him to make his business successful and generate a stable and considerable income for his large family. Sohibjon has a large and friendly family who are always trying to help each other.\r\n<br>Today, knowing that prices for animals are not so high now, but will increase for sure, Sohibjon is planning to enlarge his stock and purchase cattle. With this purpose in mind, he is requesting $1000 USD. You could become an important part of Sohibjon's family's life. He deeply appreciates the trust and support you are giving him.      \r\n<p>\r\n<b>More about Tajikistan<\/b><br>\r\nTajikistan, a key post on the Silk Road, is perhaps best known for its rich history. It was the location for the end of Alexander the Great's rule, and is known for its great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country, with its epic mountain passes, is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mix of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<br>However, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the USSR, damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 per cent of the country is mountainous and only 7 per cent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands of people to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>More about IMON International<\/b><br>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition.

Zoila sale a repartir el pan con los diferentes clientes los cuales la consideran una persona muy trabajadora y responsable quien siempre entrega sus pedidos a tiempo, por lo que muchas personas la prefieren. Zoila solicita un pr\u00e9stamo a Integral, por medio del cual pueda contar con el dinero necesario para invertir en el negocio comprando toda la materia prima necesaria para la elaboraci\u00f3n del pan, tales como harina, levadura, az\u00facar y otros m\u00e1s, as\u00ed mismo poder comprar mayor cantidad de le\u00f1a para obtenerla a precios m\u00e1s bajos. La panader\u00eda para Zoila ha resultado ser un negocio muy factible, el cual no solo le permite salir adelante como persona sino tambi\u00e9n salir adelante con su hogar.","en":"Zoila is 48 years old and lives in Santa Mar\u00eda, located in the Usult\u00e1n department.  She lives with her husband who works.  Zoila has a bakery in her home, where she and two other people bake bread in a wood fired artesian oven.  This attracts many people because this method of baking is very uncommon now.\r\n\r\nZoila delivers the bread to different customers who consider her to be a hard working and responsible person.  Many people prefer to buy from her because she always delivers on time.  She is asking for this loan through Integral in order to invest in her business and buy ingredients and supplies such as flour, yeast, sugar, etc.  She would also like to buy a large quantity of firewood in order to be able to buy at lower prices.  They bakery has proven to be a successful business, not only allowing her to get ahead as a person, but also within her home.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Hugo Reyes, Kiva

She thanks you for your support. \r\n\r\nWhether on the streets of Kathmandu or in the villages outside of the capital, tea shops are places of business and meeting in Nepal.  Called a chiya pasal, these tea shops make a sweet, milky tea that can be purchased for a few cents a cup.  With a Kiva loan, BPW's borrowers are able to keep their store shelves stocked while increasing their profit margins by buying in greater volume. \r\n\r\nThis loan was administered by Kiva's local partner MFI, Patan Business and Professional Women.

y tambi\u00e9n de queso.  Desde hace 30 a\u00f1os, su madre viaj\u00f3 a Venezuela, pa\u00eds fronterizo con Colombia, y le dej\u00f3 una tienda en la que Myriam puso su primera venta de avena y pan, posteriormente cambi\u00f3 esta actividad por la de fabricaci\u00f3n de fritos, actividad que ha conservado durante sus cambios de residencia y con la cual ha logrado salir adelante con su familia.  Myriam sabe hacer de todo un poco en el \u00e1rea de culinaria, porque tambi\u00e9n ha tenido negocio de restaurante, e ha ido bien pero cuando se tiene que mudar empieza nuevamente la venta de fritos.  En esta actividad la ayuda su hermana, distribuyen en tiendas y  a la comunidad de su barrio al detalle. Sus compras las hace de contado en peque\u00f1as cantidades y su sue\u00f1o de crecimiento, est\u00e1 basado en adecuar una buena infraestructura para mostrar sus productos y ofrecer un ambiente confortable a sus clientes.  Esta es la raz\u00f3n por la cual acude a su credikiva, primer financiamiento que hace a la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, con el cual comprar\u00e1  una vitrina,  un peso para pesar el queso, mesas y sillas para agregar almuerzos, como un nuevo producto que \u00faltimamente ha pedido su mercado, pues conocen la saz\u00f3n con que en este negocio se cocina. Su sue\u00f1o m\u00e1s adelante es tener su casa propia y sobre todo crecer como empresaria y como negociante, teniendo el capital de trabajo suficiente para mantener a su clientela como  a ella le gusta: satisfecha.","en":"Myriam, 56, is an enterprising woman and mother of a 21-year-old son.  She lives in the city of Barranquilla and works making fried fast food items, cakes, \u2018hayacas\u2019 [type of tamale] and other products derived from wheat flour; she also sells soft-drinks and cheese.  \r\n\r\nThirty years ago her mother moved to Venezuela, a country bordering Colombia, and left Myriam a store where she started her first business selling oatmeal and bread.  She later changed this business for the one making fried fast food items, an activity she\u2019s kept throughout her changes in residence and with which she\u2019s managed to get ahead with her family.  \r\n\r\nMyriam knows how to do a little of everything related to cooking because she\u2019s also owned a restaurant.  She\u2019s done well but every time she has to move she falls back on making fried fast food.  Her sister helps her in this activity; they sell to local stores and to her neighborhood community at retail.  She buys in small amounts and pays cash and her dream for growth is based on installing improved infrastructure to display her products and provide a comfortable environment for her customers.  \r\n\r\nThis is the reason she\u2019s calling on Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo to request her first Kiva loan to buy a display case, a scale to weigh the cheese and tables and chairs to start serving lunches as a new product her market is asking for because they know the tasty way she cooks.  Her dream for later on is to own her house and, above, all, to grow as a businesswoman and merchant having sufficient working capital to keep her customers the way she likes to:

She is a retired clinical officer and an active member of Konguini Jisaidie. The group has been working with WEEC for the last four years. Since she joined the group for years ago, she has borrowed four loans and paid very well. \r\nSusan started her business in 2003; she sells new clothes which she buys from Nairobi and some from Tanzania such as Vitenge.

Today Mahmud is thinking about expanding his business, because his current earnings are not enough to provide for his family. He wants to purchase more calves and fodder.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  Even today, Tajikistan is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New Western culture, and Central Asian traditions. \r\n\r\nTajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 percent of the country is mountainous and only 7 percent of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve ittheirs agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients have the opportunity to support themselves through viable businesses. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She lives with her husband and two children, who are 14 and 18 years old.  Her children are students and her husband works as a taxi driver, which is exhausting work.  Sometimes things don\u2019t go well and he has to drive all over the city looking for customers so he can earn money to take home to his family.  Celia has a general store which she opened with money that her husband gave her so she could support them when he was unemployed.  This is the second loan that she has requested and she will use the loan to invest in the purchase of various products to stock her store and increase sales.  She hopes that this will help the store a great deal, as well as help her get ahead in her personal life and keep supporting her children\u2019s education.

Her husband is a farmer and a fisherman. The family resides in a beautiful village in front of Cuyo East Pass facing the South China Sea, on the island of Panay, Philippines. She buys and resells fish and vegetables to support the needs of the family. She applied for this loan to buy farm supplies such as seed, fertilizer, and insecticides, and to get additional capital for fish vending. Balbina wants to purchase these items in advance so as to get a lower price, because when she buys during planting season the cost is much higher. She hopes that in the future she can save their harvest for their own consumption rather than sell the harvest to finance their next

They are currently in school. She is a petty trader who trades in garlic and ginger. Apart from being used to spice up food, garlic and ginger have medicinal properties. They are used in preparation of local herbal mixtures in the treatment of malaria and other common ailments. <P>\r\n\r\nBeatrice has been a retailer of ginger and garlic for the past two years and has since been very resourceful to her family. She wants to use the loan to buy a bulk supply of garlic and ginger to serve her customers throughout the season, especially in the face of increasing food prices due to the current food crisis in the country.

She lives, together with her family, a couple of blocks away from the city's garbage dump area, popularly known as Payatas. Under and around the foot of the gigantic mountain of garbage live Philippines' poorest urban residents, the scavengers. Lorna has four kids, two of whom are in college. Her eldest already graduated from college, all thanks to her rice business. \r\n\r\nLhor owns one of the only three government rice-distribution stores in Payatas. She regularly receives two rice deliveries per week. Each delivery gives her 20 sacks (50 kilos each) of government rice, which she pays for upon delivery. She then repacks the rice and sells it to the community for PHP18.00 per kilo, half the price of other commercial rice. The delivery, repacking and selling all lasts but a day after delivery. The business earns an income of PHP20,000.00 per month.\r\n\r\nLhor considers the business not only as a blessing to her family, but most importantly to her community. More than 300 residents, some of them scavengers from around Payatas, line up every week to get their weekly ration of rice. The line can go as far as 100 meters from the front of Lhor's store. She says she wants to upgrade her order of 40 sacks a week to 70, because more and more families are not able to buy their ration because Lhor's supply runs out every time for them. Dealers like Lorna are chosen by the Social Welfare Department as authorized distributors to poor communities.\r\n\r\nLhor has never missed a savings or loan payment for all her six years of borrowing. Her previous loan was for PHP30,000. She is now borrowing her 13th loan from the Center for Community Transformation (CCT).\r\n\r\nCCT is a Filipino family-oriented and Bible-centered development organization that provides and creates equal business opportunities for small-scale Filipino entrepreneurs through loans and social interventions."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":346485,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Expand
