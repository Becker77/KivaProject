is a 45-year-old woman living in the town of Samata.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from planting and harvesting fruits and vegetables for sale. Faasegia has been engaged in this business for over three years and earns approximately 800 WST a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Faasegia joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Faasegia has successfully repaid a previous loan of 1000 WST from SPBD. This previous loan was used to purchase general farm supplies and equipment. Faasegia is now requesting a new loan of 1000 WST which will be used to purchase general farm supplies and equipment. The loan will be the second loan taken out by the borrower from SPBD. Faasegia plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her

Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 300 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php 10,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, beverages and other products needed in her business. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nEmerita hopes her business grows in the coming years and dreams to be able to give her family a good future through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week, and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies. \r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

Essentially they produce and sell food (soumbala, which is a fermented paste made from locust seeds; and local beverages).  \r\n\r\nThe search for supplementary financial resources is the reason why this group of women has decided to collaborate with the institution  After having correctly repaid the first solidarity loan (group loan), the group is on its second loan.  These women each intend to use this new loan to buy 250 kg of n\u00e9r\u00e9 seeds (locust seeds), a large stock of firewood, and various other articles.  They get their supplies locally at the marketplaces of Oueless\u00e9bougou and its surrounding areas for n\u00e9r\u00e9 seeds (from a tree that is a source of oil in sub-Saharan regions).  As for the various articles, such as powdered juices, dah (fried hibiscus blossoms), sugar, and plastic bags, they buy them from Bamako (capital of Mali) and sometimes locally.  \r\n\r\nThey make their sales locally out of homes in the village and to retailers who come from the big cities, such as Bougouni, Bamako, and Kati. Sales are generally made in cash. They each intend to realize a monthly profit of 36,000 francs CFA, which will be used essentially to bolster their working capital.  \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1175,"image":{"id":207198,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"To buy raw materials for making soumbala and local soft drinks ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Ouelessebougou Koulikoro","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.996041 -7.913563","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2008-10-01T07:04:48Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1175,"lender_count":41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Flama","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fanta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bintou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatoumata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Haby","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Setou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mama","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-10-24T15:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":525000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":87500},{"due_date":"2008-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":87500},{"due_date":"2009-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":87500},{"due_date":"2009-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":87500},{"due_date":"2009-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":87500},{"due_date":"2009-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":87500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":195.83},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":195.83},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":195.83},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":195.83},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":195.83},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":195.85}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":195.83,"local_amount":87500,"processed_date":"2008-11-24T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T02:45:47Z","rounded_local_amount":87682.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5350959},{"amount":195.83,"local_amount":87500,"processed_date":"2008-12-24T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:35:52Z","rounded_local_amount":87682.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9974022},{"amount":195.83,"local_amount":87500,"processed_date":"2009-01-24T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:29:47Z","rounded_local_amount":87682.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14889395},{"amount":195.83,"local_amount":87500,"processed_date":"2009-02-24T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:14:43Z","rounded_local_amount":87682.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20440188},{"amount":195.83,"local_amount":87500,"processed_date":"2009-03-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T22:11:45Z","rounded_local_amount":87682.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27135556},{"amount":195.85,"local_amount":87500,"processed_date":"2009-04-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:34:13Z","rounded_local_amount":87682.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36033357}],"funded_date":"2008-10-10T15:00:00Z","paid_date":"2009-05-15T23:34:13Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Daniel Kuey","image":669418}},{"id":70989,"name":"Mrs. Mork Nhoth Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Mork N., a group leader of five who all live in Svay Prey Village in Kampong Cham Province, recently married Mrs. Yorn Yeth, a construction worker.

She usually works alone because her partner is involved in a different activity and her daugher is in school.  Her business earns good profits thanks to the effort she puts into it.  She goes out at 9am and works until 6pm only coming home to prepare lunch and care for her family.\r\n\r\nFor the future, she plans to set up a store in her house so that she can sell more comfortably.  For this, however, she needs more capital and she still doesn't have the necessary time to dedicate to her business because she must care for her daughter and see to household chores.  This is why the store is still in her future plans.\r\n\r\nThis is Betty's 4th loan with MFP and she promisses to be as punctual now with her repayments as she's been in the past.\r\n\r\nShe will use

He is married to Lurdes, who is a housewife.  They live together in their own home, along with their children aged 15, 8 and 1.  Luis is a farmer, and he has a 15 hectare plot of land  that he took ownership of when he arrived in this area 15 years ago from his hometown of Huanuco.  He is currently cultivating 4 hectares of yucca crops, some of which he sells in the markets in the capital and the other part in the markets of the city of Pucallpa.  To grow and harvest the crops, he depends of the labor of 6 workers, each one of whom he pays 20 Peruvian soles daily.  He enjoys his work in the countryside, and it also generates income to pay for his household as well as the education of his children.  On the negative side, what he doesn't like about the work is when the crops are destroyed by pests, causing him economic losses.  However, he has plans to expand his business and plant even more citrus, and venture into a new area by cultivating palm oil, a product for which there is increasing demand.  This will be loan number 8 with the MFP institution, and he appreciates the opportunity that he is being provided by having this financial support to reach for his goals.  With the sum of 2,000 Peruvian soles that he requests, he will invest in expanding his yucca cultivations to cover more hectares, and he will hire 3 more laborers to do this work."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":959114,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to hire 3 workers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-12-25T20:20:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":750,"lender_count":27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Luis ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-11-24T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":750}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":750,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:11:52Z","rounded_local_amount":2019,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294400891}],"funded_date":"2011-12-26T02:14:15Z","paid_date":"2012-08-15T10:11:52Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lisa Grobar","image":264298}},{"id":383271,"name":"Carmen","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Carmen is from Calabayan Ozamis City.

This is 33 year old Josephine M. from Mwanza. She is married with two children, between the ages of 17 and 23 years old. Josephine has been running a caf\u00e9 business since 2007. A local restaurant or caf\u00e9 in Tanzania usually consists of a rough wooden table and some long, wooden benches. The food is all local: rice, ugali (a hot sticky dough, made from maize flour), plantain (a cooked savoury banana), all served with beans, vegetables, meat, and a variety of sauces. She works at the business for 12 hours per days per week and is assisted by two employees. Josephine currently earns about 200USD from her business.

Josephine thanks you for your support!\r\n\r\nABOUT SELFINA!\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":347688,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cafe","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To purchase beans, rice, wheat maize and cooking oil.

He is the third brother out of 8, and has decided to build up his career.  He is single, he studies, and he lives in his parent's house.  Since he became of legal age, he has sowed and cultivated his parent's small farm to earn money and pay for his studies.\r\n<p>\r\nHis preferred sowing is peas, because he can harvest 2 or 3 times from a single sowing and it doesn't require much investment in fertilizer.  With it, he can do alternating sowings and earn very good profits, with which he can pay the expenses of the room that he rents in the city where he studies, which is situated 3 hours from his native village.  As a result, on weekends he travels alone very early in the morning on Saturdays to be with his crops, whose harvests he finishes with marketing directly in the wholesale market in the city.  \r\n<p>\r\nLuis is confident that he will pursue his profession gracefully, and turn into a very successful engineer.

Because of an invitation, he became a member of a community bank, where he feels very happy with the form of work and for the personalized support of the loan advisor.

Since the program was launched in December 2008, until June 2009, 120 parents have received financing, ranging in size from 50,000 to 150,000 frs.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by MONICA URBAN, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":459328,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To increase operating funds.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SN","country":"Senegal","town":"DAKAR","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"14.695112 -17.443886","type":"point"}},"partner_id":108,"posted_date":"2009-12-28T14:20:14Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marieme","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-12-24T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":150000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2010-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2010-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2010-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2010-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2010-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2010-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2010-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2010-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2010-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":15000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":35,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2010-01-24T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:49:27Z","rounded_local_amount":15950.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118168508},{"amount":35,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2010-02-24T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T11:35:05Z","rounded_local_amount":15950.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":124007461},{"amount":35,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2010-03-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T10:16:19Z","rounded_local_amount":15950.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":129036527},{"amount":35,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2010-04-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T12:35:35Z","rounded_local_amount":15950.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136759085},{"amount":35,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2010-05-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-18T08:23:34Z","rounded_local_amount":15950.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144790599},{"amount":35,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2010-06-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-17T08:36:31Z","rounded_local_amount":15950.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151971037},{"amount":35,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2010-07-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T12:16:05Z","rounded_local_amount":15950.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159708304},{"amount":35,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2010-08-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-24T08:41:14Z","rounded_local_amount":15950.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166922375},{"amount":35,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2010-09-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:49:02Z","rounded_local_amount":15950.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172188881},{"amount":35,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2010-10-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-26T11:53:39Z","rounded_local_amount":15950.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177484328}],"funded_date":"2009-12-28T17:03:23Z","paid_date":"2010-11-26T11:53:40Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"MONICA URBAN","image":1592573}},{"id":169609,"name":"Guadalufe","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Guadalufe is a rice farmer.

After leaving the military he started working in an orphanage school (Casa do Gaiato) as an upholsterer, a trade he learned from his father when he was young. He doesn't have any employees, and instead relies on his son's assistance. He brings in about 5000 meticals a month, which is enough to cover household expenses and also save a little in a bank account.\r\nHe's never received loans from other banks. He learned about Hvuluku from his neighbor, who is also a Hvuluku client. This is his second loan, in the amount of 13,000 meticals, which he will use to purchase materials (nails, springs, etc.) to continue his work. His previous loan was for 2500 meticals.\r\nHe'd like to request additional loans in the future, to be used in his business and also to finish his house and offer his family better living

She is 29 years old, and when she was 13 she learned how to weave backpacks with a neighbor.  This is currently her main activity because handicrafts have allowed her to earn money, take care of the household chores, and generate income.  Her husband is an elementary school teacher.  They dream and work persistently in order to get their four children ahead.  The children range in ages from two to ten.\r\n\r\nThis is her second loan with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  She will use the loan to buy a greater volume of yarn to weave the backpacks and handbags.  That way she will be getting new customers, and she will start on her dream of having a handicraft place for storage.  It will have the raw material for making her beautiful indigenous backpacks and hammocks, which are very well known.  With the profits, she aspires to generate more income for her family\u2019s well-being, to finish building her house, and that her children become professionals in the future.\r\n\r\nShirley says that in her business she has had many challenges that she learned from.

She earns her living by operating a Carenderia or eatery  business.  Her husband Nonilo P., who is 41 years old, works as a Carpenter and Plumber to earn his living, and also helps in his wife's business activities.  They have 4 children who are 3 to 20 years old. \r\n\r\nEdna joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1998 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 13 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Edna has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 19500 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 20000,  uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 14th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 20000, which she intends to use to purchase of raw food ingredients to cook and sell in her carenderia or eatery so that she could continue to earn and  save up for future for the education of her children. Edna P. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She lives with Roberto who is 44 years old; they have 4 children together but they only live with 2 of them: Diana who is 15 and Adan who is 12.  They live in their own home located in the Peruvian jungle (in the Pumpuriani native community center).  Everyday, she goes to a small home on the side of her land; here, she can spend more time taking care of plants and her land.  Lorena grows coffee, banana, corn, and yucca; she has very little time because as soon as she finishes cleaning and fertilizing her land, she takes care of her chickens.  She has worked in agriculture for the last 30 years and she is very happy.  She enjoys the time she spends with her family.  She has purchased 4 blocks of banana fields where she would like to grow large amounts of bananas.  With this purchase, Violeta will have 5 blocks of coffee plants, and 4 blocks ready to be planted.  This is the 4th loan she will receive from MFP and she is grateful to the village bank since she has learned a lot in the classes that they offer.  With the loan she will buy 2,000 banana plants which cost about $25 each.\r\n\r\nVioleta, de 42 a\u00f1os, es una mujer alegre y muy colaboradora, convive con Roberto, de 44 a\u00f1os, ambos tienen 4 hijos, de los cuales solo vive con 2 de ellos Diana de 15 y Ad\u00e1n de 12 a\u00f1os, en su casa propia ubicada en la selva peruana (comunidad nativa Centro Pumpuriani).

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is married with three sons and two daughters. Musharraf has a project raising sheep and benefits from selling their products. This is the only source of income for the family.

He is 41 years old and lives in the Memorial Sandino neighborhood in the capital of Managua. His wife has four children: the two eldest work with him and the other two cannot go to school due to financial reasons. It has been impossible to send his children to class because it's been a difficult year.  His business is selling scrap, copper and aluminu. Previously, he worked as an auto mechanic. He bought a truck for hauling and now he sells scrap. His wish is to be able to build a dignified home for his family since where they live now is at the point of falling apart. It has been difficult to build since what he earns he invests in food and the neceessities for his job. But he has not lost the dream of achieving a safe concrete house. It is for this reason that he wants to invest more in the purchase of scrap, copper and aluminum in order to obtain greater income and begin building what is desired. He is thankful to Afodenic for the loan since it allows him to invest in his business which in turn brings benefits to his family.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Kate Divjak, Kiva

He is 50, a widow, and the father of 2 children who are 14 and 16.  Both of them go to school.  He studied through 11th grade and didn't continue due to the lack of financial resources.  He lives in his own home with his children and doesn't support anybody else.  He left Chimoio in 1977 to complete his military service.  After he finished his military career, he joined the Ministry of the Interior where he still works 8 hours a day.

She has three children under 10 years old. Her business is a store located in her mother\u2019s house. She has had her store for a year and a half. With help from her husband she was able to establish her business. She is requesting a loan in order to stock her store with more products to offer her customers, since the village she lives in is small and far from town. \r\n\r\nAna is widowed with two small children. She has sold tamales three times a week for two years. She sells tamales in her home and her customers already know her and seek her out. Her dream now is to raise her children and to give them a good life. \r\n\r\nBerta works selling disposable products in Ciudad Quetzal where she rents a small shop. She has six children, three adults and three children. Her plan for this loan is to buy more products since there isn\u2019t that much competition in the vicinity so it is important to have a variety of disposable products that her customers ask for. \r\n\r\nThese women have proven to be hard workers and in spite of setbacks have continued to move forward and have many plans that involve improving the quality if their families\u2019 lives.

Cela fait maintenant 20 ans que Minata cultive l'arachide pour sa valeur vivri\u00e8re, expliquant que l\u2019arachide est directement consommable par la famille et est utilis\u00e9e comme sauce de base dans l\u2019alimentation et aussi pour sa rentabilit\u00e9 productive et marchande. Minata planifie avec l\u2019augmentation de ses rendements et de son revenu  de faire de l'\u00e9levage, cultiver plus  d\u2019arachide, riz et d'\u00e9tendre la surface cultiv\u00e9e . Enfin Minata esp\u00e8re aussi pouvoir couvrir les frais scolaires des enfants ainsi qu'assurer l'autosuffisance alimentaire de la famille. ","en":"Minata, who is standing on the right in the photo, is a member of a group of 10 farmers who are members of myAgro, living and working in the village of Diensobala in the southeast of Bamako, Mali. \r\n\r\nMinata, aged 52, is the mother of eight children aged 12 to 28, of whom two are presently in school. The family tradition is centered around agriculture, the main source of income and of food self-sufficiency for the household, and also of Minata's family, which has moved Minata to do this activity for 45 years now. \r\n\r\nMinata grows peanuts and rice on her plot, but as a farmer she has to face such difficulties as lack of rain, of agricultural tools, and of laborers. \r\n\r\nMinata is beginning her first year with myAgro and she joined because of the training and agricultural techniques and with the perspective of increasing her harvests  through the services proposed by myAgro, and also the positive image of myAgro in the neighboring villages. \r\n\r\nThis year Minata is making the payments to buy a myAgro package of openly pollinated seeds and fertilizer to grow peanuts so as to increase her harvest on her plot of 0.0625 hectares. Minata has been growing peanuts for 20 years for their nutritive value. She explains that peanuts can be eaten directly by the family, are used as a base for sauces in cooking, and are also a money-earning crop when sold. \r\n\r\nMinata plans to increase her output and her income so that she can raise livestock, grow more peanuts and rice, and expand her cultivated surface. Ultimately, Minata also wishes to pay school fees for the children as well as ensuring food self-sufficiency for her family.

She is 35 years old, single, and the mother of 5 children with ages 17, 14, 12, 10, and 1.  All of them go to school except the youngest.  She went to school until the 4th grade and did not continue because of her poor financial conditions.\r\n\r\nShe lives in her own home with her family in the Matola-rio neighborhood, and she does not support anyone else.  She left Cibuto for Maputo in 1988 with her parents due to the destabilization war.  She has been the owner of her own business for eight years, and she works with her husband around 10 hours per day.\r\n\r\nShe is able to earn around 8,000MT per month which are applied to home expenses, and she is still able to save a little in Xitique (traditional system of rotary savings) monthly with her friends.  She has never had loans through other banks, and she came to know Hluvuku through her neighbor who is also a client of the institution.\r\n\r\nThis is her first loan for 8,000MT with which she intends to purchase products (chicken, soft drinks, and beer) to increase the volume of her business.  In the future, she intends to expand her business to other locations and is committed to paying back the current loan so she can accept more credit.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by

The group consists of nine members. \r\n\r\nCamila A. is a member of the group.  She is 48 years old and only has a grade school education. She makes clay pots. She has dedicated herself to pottery for 15 years, as it is a family tradition.  Her mom taught her the trade when she lost her job as a domestic servant.  She lives with her mom and her brother.  She asks for the loan to be able to buy raw materials to use to make pots.  She sells the pots without kilning them, and as she has no vehicle to transport her product, she only sells to her neighbors.  Her dream is to construct a room with plate to be able to store her pots as the rainy season is approaching.\r\n\r\nThe name of the members of the group and their job are:\r\n\r\nIGNACIA S.

She thanks you for your support.  \r\n\r\nIn the Kathmandu Valley, the small grocery store, called a pasal, is an important part of the local economy.  Fresh produce, milk, and staples such as rice, lentils, and flour are purchased daily for cooking in the home.  Owners of small grocery stores use Kiva loans to increase their purchasing power and profit margain.

He lives with his life partner and their two-year-old baby in the home that his mother left him.\r\n\r\nHe has sold seafood (conches and curiles-- a type of clam) for three years. His mother, who worked selling seafood her whole life, taught him this business. Maule now serves his mother's former customers and has obtained others as well. He has a large market, since he sells in two of the country's biggest cities.\r\n\r\nIn Manuel's business, his products are harvested from the sea. In order to do this, he has six people who go out on his two fishing boats to collect the conches. They work every day from 6:00 am to 11:00 am. Manuel also buys curiles and conches from the local residents who harvest seafood. Manuel packs his products into a vehicle and transports them to the markets where he sells them. He gets up at 4:00 am to go to work.\r\n\r\nHe is requesting a loan from Fundacion Campo to purchase more conches, to improve his fishing boats, and to hire more people to help him harvest conches; the season in which conches are scarce is approaching. This way, he will be able to have more products and satisfy his customers' demand and expand his business on the national level. With this investment, Manuel will be able to offer his beloved wife and little daughter a better quality of life.\r\n\r\nManuel has two well-defined goals: to buy his own vehicle for transporting his merchandise, and to make improvements to his  home so that his family can have better living conditions."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":894625,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It is her wish that her business will develop with the assistance of a loan. \r\n\r\nHer husband is a farm laborer and does not earn enough to take care of the daily needs of the family, especially the needs of their only child who is presently studying at college. For their child\u2019s education to be sustained until graduation, Gorgonia regularly requests a loan through ASHI to develop her business' profits. Being poor, Gorgonia at times is hesitant to take out a larger loan from ASHI. However, her determination to bring her family out of poverty gives her the courage to face the consequences, including the interest rate of her loan. Eventually, she will overcome the obstacle of being poor. She is able to operate a few businesses, just in case one fails. \r\n\r\nGorgonia will use the present loan for her hog raising and rice farming business. Income from her other business, selling \u201ckopra\u201d and vegetables, has enabled her to repay her loan from ASHI weekly including its interest. Seeing her only child continuously study in college is the fulfillment of the dream she keeps in her heart, and is the result of the hard work she does every day.

She owns a business venture, planting & harvesting taro for sale.  Sii has many years of experience in this business.  Sii needs a loan of WST $1500 to purchase weed-killers such as Gramoxome.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 300 talas or US $125 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2006, Sii joined SPBD.  This is her 5th loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Sii's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Sii A. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                         1.3 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:            1.9 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:                1.6 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

Life in rural areas of the Dominican Republic can be rough, with no potable running water, frequent power outages (if one has power to begin with), and inadequate access to healthcare, among other dangers. Despite these difficulties, Flavia runs a successful business selling coconuts. Coconuts are a popular snack in the Dominican Republic, and can be sold for their milk, meat, and oil. With this loan, Flavia will purchase more coconuts to sell at a small markup to her customers.\r\n\r\nThis is Flavia\u2019s eighth loan with Esperanza International. With her access to capital, she hopes to continue the growth of her business.

She hopes to one day purchase a computer and build her own home, two very important moves out of the cycle of poverty. \r\n\r\nEsperanza International seeks to free children and their families from poverty through initiatives that generate income, education and health, restoring self-worth and dignity to those who have lost hope.

Bogo, Argao, Cebu.  She earns her living by operating two business ventures:  abaca weaving and Ready-to-Wear clothes businesses.  Her husband Modesto A., who is 65 years old, works as a laborer to earn his living and also helps in his wife's business activities.  They have four children who are 34 to 42 years old.  \r\n\r\nFlorentina  joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2005 because she aspired for something better for her family.  With the help of her past 11 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Florentina has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 27,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 20,000, thus uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 12th loan, she is borrowing PHP 27,000 which she intends to use as additional business capital so that she can continue to save up for the future.  \r\n\r\nFlorentina  A. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\n\r\n In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed on a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

This family lives in their own house in Villa Mar\u00eda Alto Yurinaki, an indigenous community in the Chanchamayo Province. \r\n\r\nChristian is a businessman and a very hard worker. He does agricultural work on his 3 parcels of land, growing coffee, plantains, and cassava. Plantains are much sought after in the region around Villa Mar\u00eda due to its good soil and mild climate. So every two weeks Christian harvests 20 \"arrobas\" [\"arroba\" is a unit of measure equal to 24-36 pounds depending on the region], which he sells with great success in the city of Pichanaki. \r\n\r\nHe likes his work because he is more independent and especially because his own efforts determine his income. To facilitate his work he hires personnel who help him to build up the soil around the plants, remove weeds, and plant his crops, mainly the coffee. When he finds himself in some economic tight spot, the plantain and cassava always get him through, since they are biweekly while the coffee is annual.  He wants to plant more produce for the next month, and to do so he will rent land from neighbors or friends. \r\n\r\nThis will be the first loan that Christian has received from MFP. He takes responsibility for being punctual in making his payments. He is happy to belong to \"Los Productores Yaneshas\" communal bank. On obtaining the money, he will be able to purchase bags of fertilizer for his coffee plants and will pay for the services of the farm workers who will support him in the arduous work.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":977619,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase bags of manure and to hire farm workers.

The members of this communal bank carry out a variety of different businesses, such as selling milk, selling CD's, carpentry, selling cheese, selling livestock, selling wool and woven bedding.\r\n\r\nVirginia is one of the female micro entrepreneurs who will benefit from the loan they will take out. She says that this is the first time she has been a part of Pro Mujer, joining at the invitation of a group promoter who came to visit her at her house. At present she has a dairy business that she says she learned several years ago, picking up the skills from her mother, whom she helped since childhood.\r\n \r\nThe loan she will take out now is for an increase in capital (the purchase of a dairy cow) that she will buy from the neighboring fairs and, after raising it, she'll sell it at her store. This type of work allows her to generate resources to support her household as much as possible since she is married and has three children.\r\n\r\nWhen asked what she likes about Pro Mujer she responds that she likes the health training and the loan.\r\n"}},"status":"deleted","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1419408,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Milk Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to purchase a dairy cow.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"La Paz \/ El Alto","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.483333 -68.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":59,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":3050,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Virginia Feliza\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alejandra\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Asunta\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Reina Isabel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Feliza\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yaneth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lourdes","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-08-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":21000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":3050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":2301.24},{"due_date":"2013-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":2445.4},{"due_date":"2013-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":2512.32},{"due_date":"2013-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":2580.64},{"due_date":"2014-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":2651.2},{"due_date":"2014-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":2724},{"due_date":"2014-03-10T07:00:00Z","amount":2798.2},{"due_date":"2014-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":2987}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":334.23},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":355.16},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":364.89},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":374.8},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":385.06},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":395.63},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":406.4},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":433.83}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Melissa Paulson","image":1289394}}]}
