The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n<P>\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Inc.), an MFI and Kiva partner in the Philippines. She is married and is the mother to two: a boy and a girl. Both of her children are still dependent on her to survive. Her husband, Francisco, is 37 years old and is a fisherman. they lives in the island village in the town of Binangonan, Rizal Province in the Philippines.\n\nWith her dream to lift up her family from poverty, Domenciana joined ASHI in 2008 with hopes to have access to capital for her business. During her early loans, she invested them all in purchasing fishing nets and other fishing gear. She was been running her fishing business for almost fifteen years and it brings her a good income for the sustainability of the needs of her family.\n\nNow on her third loan, Domenciana requests 15,000 pesos as additional capital for her business. The loan will be used to pay for twenty bundles of assorted types of fishing nets, ropes, and other materials for fishing. She is hopeful that, with the trust and support from ASHI and Kiva, she can reach her dream little by little, send her children to school up to college level and repair her house to make it spacious and more

Guldasta is a hard worker and a person who takes charge. She is married and has three children. Her husband receives a very low wage and he could not handle all the expenses of his family. For this reason, Guldasta found it necessary to start a family business. Guldasta began to sell foodstuffs in her grocery store. This was the start of the business, and together they have managed to advance it. Guldasta is now requesting a loan of 3500 somoni to expand her business to be able to offer a better service to her clients, and to improve the store. Guldasta thanks you for the confidence and aid that you offer her.   \r\n<p>\r\n<b>More about Tajikistan and IMON International:<\/b>\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its epic mountain passes and its rich history which includes its place as a key post along the Silk Road and events at the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has produced famous thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. A civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged an already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural productivity and the manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent viable business prospects.

She has two children, 41 and 38, whom do not live with Mrs. A.. When not working with her clothing shop, she enjoys going to the beach and cooking, arroz con carne (rice with meat) being one of her favorite dishes. As Mrs. A. is in her elder years and has fully grown children, she simply wishes to sustain her business to support her and her husband.\r\n<p>Mrs. Senaida A. is a member of an eight person group, Group 4, that is part of a larger micro-bank called Mujeres D. Fe, \"Women of Faith\" in English. In the picture, Mrs. A. is third from the right along with members of her group and some others of Mujeres D. Fe. Her story is just one of a list of men and women who are improving their quality of life through the help of micro-credit loans of Esperanza. Together, this group has united with a common vision of a better life with faith and hope in their hearts and an unbreakable spirit. The concept of group lending is to have loans paid in a group to reduce the risk of a person defaulting, as others pick up where a person may lag to receive the next loan.

She is helping her husband earn a living by collecting and selling firewood in their village. During weekends, their children also help her collect wood, and she is very grateful to them because they know that her business means a lot to their family.\r\n\r\nSusana is married to Pedro, a local farmer in their village. They are helping each other to provide for the needs of their family, especially the education of their children who are still studying. They are blessed with five children: Antonio, 33 years old and a high school graduate; Orlan, 29 years old and a high school graduate; Eric, 21 years old and an elementary school graduate; Maximo, 15 years old and a senior high school student; and Christian, 11 years old and a fifth grade student. \r\n<p>\r\nSusana wanted to become an entrepreneur, but lack of capital prevented her from sustaining her wood business. Therefore, she is requesting a loan from the Kiva lenders amounting to 5,000 PHP, which she will use as capital to run her business. She is very optimistic that lenders will approve her loan.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":125,"image":{"id":419403,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fuel\/Firewood","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Additional

En su pueblo natal Idalia  tenia un negocio de vender prendas de oro, y al partir de all\u00ed, porque se volvi\u00f3   dif\u00edcil la convivencia pac\u00edfica, abandon\u00f3 su negocio y trajo solo $100.000 COP, pero como ya ten\u00eda  la experiencia de negocios, no abandon\u00f3 la convicci\u00f3n de iniciarlo en la nueva poblaci\u00f3n; as\u00ed fue que invirti\u00f3 en mercanc\u00eda y reparti\u00f3 entre varios clientes que le recomendaron  a los que semanalmente visitaba para recoger el dinero producto de sus ventas, que volv\u00eda a invertir  y con este trabajo lograba generar  utilidades para ayudar a sostener su hogar. \n\nComo esto no le alcanzaba para responder a su clientela, se emple\u00f3 de dom\u00e9stica es una casa por d\u00edas   y fue as\u00ed como reuni\u00f3 dinero para comprar constantemente; cuando obtuvo su capital , a\u00fan quedaba mal en responder a los pedidos,  por eso una amiga le recomend\u00f3 buscar un cr\u00e9dito con la  Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo y ella accedi\u00f3,  hizo algunos cursos administrativos, pero a pesar de que le aprobaron su cr\u00e9dito, su esposo como no ten\u00eda experiencia en este tipo de financiamiento, le recomend\u00f3 no retirar el dinero de su cuenta y devolverlo, ella as\u00ed lo hizo mientras continuaba trabajando con mucha dificultad lo que la oblig\u00f3 a regresar a esta organizaci\u00f3n,  sin decirle a su c\u00f3nyuge  y ahora se siente muy contenta porque su negocio ha logrado crecer; antes ten\u00eda su mercanc\u00eda metida en un tanque,  hoy tiene cuatro vitrinas muy bien surtidas en un sector comercial y donde todo el que pasa le compra porque es muy concurrido. Ahora su esposo quien aparece con ella en la fotograf\u00eda se siente orgulloso de ella y la acompa\u00f1a en todas las decisiones emprendedoras de Idalia, pues ha logrado demostrar su potencial de crecimiento y gran capacidad de multiplicar su dinero. \n\nEn la actualidad solicita su credikiva para ponerle cielo raso a su negocio que con el apoyo de la fundaci\u00f3n,  logr\u00f3 adecuar un local y separar la zona familiar de la productiva y ahora necesita enchaparla para que se vea m\u00e1s vistoso y todos sus clientes no quieran Salir de \u00e9l de lo c\u00f3modo que se encuentran. Idalia dice que nada hubiera sido posible sin la ayuda de Dios, y que a \u00e9l le pide cumplir su sue\u00f1o de tener un almac\u00e9n. Su m\u00e1s grande desaf\u00edo fue cuando su hija sufri\u00f3 un accidente y ella la ayud\u00f3 a salir adelante descapitaliz\u00e1ndose un poco, aqu\u00ed recuerda como la Fundaci\u00f3n siempre en estos casos le ha tendido la mano, por eso no se cambia a ninguna instituci\u00f3n.\n \n   \n","en":"Idalia G. and Eduardo Tapias, her husband (who appears in the photo and works in another business in Barranquilla) are a couple who, between the ages of 24 and 34 years old, came with their four children from San Juan Nepomuceno to a place very near Barranquilla. In their hometown of Idalia, they were selling items made of gold; because it became difficult to live together peacefully, they abandoned their business and brought only $100,000 COP, but since they already had business experience, they did not abandon the will to begin it again in a new place; therefore, they invested in merchandise and distributed it among various customers who recommended them, and they visited them weekly to collect the money from sales, which they again invested, and in this way generated profits to help them afford their home. \n\nAs this was not enough for serving their customers, they began working out of their home by day, and this was how they earned money for constant purchases, when they had the capital, although it was still not enough to fill all the orders. Because of this a friend recommended they seek a loan with Kiva partner Fundacion Mario Santo Domingo, and Idalia agreed. She took some management classes, but when the Fundacion approved her loan, her husband, who did not have experience with this kind of financing, suggested that she not take the money out of her account and that she return it. Idalia did so, while continuing to work with great difficulty, which drove her to return to this organization without telling her husband, and now she is very pleased because her business has grown. Before, she had her merchandise displayed in a tank; now she has four well stocked display cases in a commercial area where everyone who passes buys because its very popular. Now, her husband, who is in the picture with her, is proud of her and assists her in all the business decisions. She has demonstrated her ability to grow and multiply her money. \n\nNow she is requesting her loan to put in a ceiling, and, with the help of the Fundacion, adapt the place to separate the family area from the business area. She needs to cover it so it will look nice and so her customers will never want to leave the comfort they find themselves in.  Idalia says that none of this would have been possible without God's help, and she asks Him to help her realize her dream and have a warehouse.  Her biggest challenge was when her daughter had an accident, and she helped her be more successful by selling off a bit, and she remembers how in these sorts of cases the Fundacion always lent her a hand, and because of this she will never go to any other organization.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1125,"image":{"id":609336,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Remodel

She is a hard working and very responsible woman who is the mother of two children, ages 12 and 7 years old.  They live together with her husband in her sister's house.  Delia's work is designing and making her own clothing out of Lycra (undergarments, pants, blouses).  She has started a small but very productive workshop in her sister's house.  She tell us that some time ago she worked for a man who was a distributor in a commercial center called \u201cEl Huequito de la Ciudad\u201d (The Little Hollow in the City).  However, over time she realized that she could make her own designs, as she is very good at what she does.  This is reflected in her daily sales.  What she likes most about her work is the money flow, which generates income every day.  In addition, she has time at her disposal.  Delia is very happy with the loans she has gotten from MFP because she says that they have a very low interest rate.

He is seeking a loan from Kiva lenders to be able to connect to the local solar-powered microgrid, and to finally get rid of his dirty, costly kerosene lamp. Mainly, he is looking forward to being connected as it will allow him to save money - Silome and his family will now be able to benefit from a reliable, durable, and clean power source.\n\nAfter running pilots since 2012 that proved the benefits of prepay quality electricity to people in Les Anglais (first with 14 households, and up to 54), EarthSpark International is developing a full-scale, solar-powered microgrid. This micro-grid is expected to meet the needs of up to 500 households.\u00a0Kiva loans allow EarthSpark to increase the number of beneficiaries by reducing the up-front costs for customers, and will be repaid over time by electricity sales.\n\nTo see a video of Les Anglais and the hybrid solar grid, please <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=iq2m3rRDePk\">click

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She has three children aged 14, 16 and 18 and she also takes care of one dependent from another family. Florence lives in the Kicukiro district of Kigali.\r\n\r\nFlorence has owned a business selling soft drinks, snacks and milk for the past four years and employs three people in her business. The store is open from 6 a.m. to 9 p.m. every day except Sunday.\r\n\r\nFlorence is a proven entrepreneur.

She lives with her husband, her husband\u2019s second wife and their children in Sanoubougou I, a working-class district in the city of Sikasso (the third administrative region of the republic of Mali).\r\n\r\nNot having had the opportunity to  go to school, for social reasons, she started working as a reseller of traditional colorful \u201cpagne wax\u201d  fabrics as well as embroidered  cloth about ten years ago. She is very sought after by her customers (mainly women) because of the high quality of her wares.\r\n\r\nWith the goal of better meeting the growing customer demand, she decided to join the Soro Yiriwaso microfinance institution about three years ago and is now on her third loan with this institution. The present loan is requested to purchase 10 sets of the UNIWAX brand \u201cpagnes\u201d fabric, four sets of embroidered fabric, six sets of \u201cpagne wax\u201d and four sets of damask-type \u201cbasin\u201d fabric of mid-range quality in Bamako and Bobo Dioulasso (Burkina Faso).\r\n\r\nShe has a stall at the local market, where she sells her wares for cash and on credit.With this loan, she plans to achieve a monthly income of 150,000 West African Francs, which will be used essentially to bolster her business capital, contribute to the family budget, and pay off the interest on her loan.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":766406,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing","sector":"Clothing","themes":["Rural

which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Manuela is a farmer.  \r\n\r\nDespite her age and her separation she has overcome obstacles to provide her children with necessary sustenance and education.  She grows mostly coffee on her farmland which is the product that produces the most profits.  Because this is an annual activity, the rest of the months of the year she works as a laborer on parcels belonging to neighbors and family members.  She earns a daily wage of 20 to 30 soles for this work.  \u201cThis type of work is hard on women: pruning plants, removing weeds, but I don\u2019t make problems for myself.  I have the strength to do what I enjoy,\u201d she comments.  \r\n\r\nWith help from her daughter she\u2019s able to maintain her home and pay for basic utilities.  Manuela lives comfortably but she\u2019s not complacent; she wants to expand her coffee crops and add manioc and banana crops to her farmland.  The fulfillment of her wishes depends on her acquiring more income from her businesses, to expand her house and buy some furniture as well as to live many more years to see her grandchildren grow up.  \r\n\r\nThanks to your help, this tireless woman will acquire her MFP loan #5.

After 4 years working with Ceprodel, Maria Teresa has been able to build her business from her home, and diversify her menu.

Sin embargo al ver la necesidad de ampliar su negocio, solicit\u00f3 cr\u00e9ditos a Ceprodel los cuales le fueron otorgados (actualmente 16 cr\u00e9ditos) para lo cual decidi\u00f3 remodelar su casa para poder implementar el negocio en su hogar.<p>\r\n\r\nActualmente, con cuatro a\u00f1os de trabajar con Ceprodel, la se\u00f1ora Teresa ha podido implementar su negocio en su hogar y a la vez ha diversificado su men\u00fa de los alimentos que ofrece por lo que ha logrado obtener mejores ingresos para continuar apoyando a sus dos hijos de los cuales uno de ellos cursa la educaci\u00f3n primaria y el otros es un infante que necesita de mucho cuido y atenci\u00f3n por lo que es reci\u00e9n nacido.\r\n\r\n<p> Translated by Kiva volunteer, Emily Charnes <\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":106405,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Market","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"TO PURCHASE INGREDIENTS NEEDED FOR THE SMALL RESTAURANT SHE RUNS FROM HER HOME.

The profits from this business have already allowed him to begin a small pig farm and pay his children\u2019s school fees.\r\n\r\nPeter is requesting this new loan to continue his weaving business, expand his pig farm, and begin raising poultry as well. The largest part of the loan will go to buy additional pigs, since they are the most profitable, but pigs require time to grow and reproduce. So he plans to add poultry to his farm, since they can be raised in just three months, turning a faster profit. Meanwhile, he will add about $30 to the capital in his weaving business. He says that his businesses will succeed, because pigs, poultry, and woven bags are in great demand in his community, and his local production saves people from having to travel to the city to buy these items.\r\n\r\nPeter plans to repay his loan in 18 months.

She graduated and has worked for more than 5 years in this field.  She makes athletic clothing, wedding dresses, and lingerie.  She has a workshop in her home where she makes her designs.  She tells us that her business is a little low right now because some people prefer to buy clothing that is already made, and that is why she chose to make and deliver her designs to department stores.  Each piece of clothing costs $30, $50, or $70 depending on the design and how complex it is to make.<p>\r\nTeresa is requesting a new loan from the Fundaci\u00f3n to invest in the purchase of fabric, thread, buttons, zippers, and other items to make her clothing so she can deliver her orders on time.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n--------------------------------------\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Juana is married and has a total of 6 children, 1 female and 5 males.  Juana buys and sells cattle, a business she started 5 years ago.  She is requesting a loan to buy pasture and fodder, for the purpose of keeping her animals in good condition.  Juana's customers consider her a very hard-working and responsible person, and she is recognized in her locality as having the best cared for cattle due to the great experience she has in raising cattle.\r\n\r\nJuana feels content and gratified with the service and treatment that this institution provides, in view of the fact that it is difficult to obtain credit in this economic sector.  With her earnings, Juana  intends to construct a better stable and thus, to be able to acquire more cattle.

During the days, when she works at the university, her granddaughter helps her grandmother.  Tuhfa cannot travel for merchandise herself due to her health and age, and her friends or relatives deliver merchandise to her.  They bring merchandise from Kyrgyzstan in 4-5 days.  Tuhfa plans to bring in warm clothing, such as sweaters and robes, and fabrics, such as velour, velvet and other stylish national fabrics.

As a result, she made up for the losses with her next loans. She plans on investing this 800.00 PEN loan, which will be repaid in 6 monthly installments, in the business by purchasing supplies in order to expand.

Y\u00ean Phong - B\u1eafc Ninh. N\u1ee5 is the leader of a 5-member loan group sponsored by SEDA. Although each member of the group receives an individual loan, they all are responsible for repaying the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is An Ninh 1 (5).\r\n\r\n\r\nN\u1ee5 is married and has 4 school-aged children. To making a living, N\u1ee5 owns and operates a recycling business where she hauls away plastics and other recyclables for local businesses and community members. N\u1ee5 has been engaged in this business for over 5 years and earns approximately 3.500.000 VND a month from these activities.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 2007, N\u1ee5 joined SEDA to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. N\u1ee5 has successfully repaid a previous loan of 4.256.000 VND from SEDA. This previous loan was used to purchase additional scrap metal to sell. She is now requesting a new loan of 6.048.000 VND that she will use to purchase additional scrap metal to sell. This will be N\u1ee5's third loan from SEDA. N\u1ee5 plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to financially support her immediate family members.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout the Other Borrowers in the Group:\r\n\r\n\r\n1.

Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in Vietnamese while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\r\n\r\n\r\nN\u1ee5 T\u00f4 Th\u1ecb (20213010019) l\u00e0 38 tu\u1ed5i n\u1eef.

She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family and pay the tuition of her children. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She lives in the Maica central, which is a neighborhood of the city of Cochabamba to the south. Ana is a hard-working woman who is dedicated to the production of milk.  \r\n\r\nAna is a woman that suffered as a girl with the disaffection of her mother, since there were only two sisters which were treated differently.  She was the younger and only finished a degree in the neighborhood school, while the other sister always studied in expensive schools in the center of the city.  She says that those things do sentimental damage.  Ana does not feel a grudge against her parents but is sure that she would never do that with her children. She earned a technical degree but does not practice it because she is always with her children.  She works from her house producing milk and also making cheeses that she then delivers and sells to a lady.  She does not rely on the salary of a husband.  She goes on alone, always working and helping in the education of her children and collaborating in the care of her father.  Since he is old, he has health problems and she is the one who takes charge of taking him to the doctor.  \r\n\r\nShe needs the loan to buy a head of cattle and in that way enlarge her production of milk and make more cheese.  In this way she will have greater income and sure support for her children so that they can finish school and study for a career.  She feels happy to be with them in all her free time.  This is the story of Ana.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Barbara (B) Brown, Kiva

She wants to bring her children into a decent life. During her almost four years in ASHI, she has shown herself to be industrious and determined to make her dreams come true. She joined ASHI (Ahon Sa Hirap, Inc.), an MFI and Kiva partner in the Philippines, in hopes to have secured access to capital for the continuation of her dying business. Her previous loans were carefully utilized as additional and rolling capital for her sari-sari store (a small retail store selling different goods). She is very determined and disciplined to use the money which is lent to her. Now on her 8th loan, Dolores proposes a loan of 25,000 pesos as additional working capital for her store. Specifically, the amount will be used to pay for inventories of groceries for her store. Dolores is hopeful that her business will grow into a full-fledge mini-grocery store and that someday she will have branches in nearby villages. Dolores also dreams of sending all her grandchildren to school until college and that they find jobs. One of her aspirations is to be able to build a house that is durable and

After a while, they decided to print custom t-shirts for other businesses.  One business asked them \u201cdo you do banners too?\u201d  And they said \u201cof course!\u201d even though they hadn\u2019t made banners before and did not have the necessary equipment. \u201cAnytime they ask me something, I say \u2018of course\u2019 and I start doing it \u2013 and with a lot of success! \u2026 in that fashion, little by little, we grew.  That\u2019s why they say that this is a good business.\u201d \r\n\r\nNow they can print business cards in an hour or two.  \u201cWe\u2019re very fast.  \u2026 We\u2019ll stay up all night if we need to.  If we resolve our clients\u2019 problems, they\u2019ll return or recommend us.\u201d It takes a while the first time they create a new product, though, because they have to buy materials and access machinery.  \u201cMy intention is to do everything in-house\u201d.\r\n\r\nRicardo L. and his wife plan to use this loan to stock up on raw materials, such as rolls of vinyl or rolls of magnetic sheets to print on and cartridges of ink and toner for the machines. He always wants to have materials in stock so \u201cI never have to think \u2018I have to buy this, and that, and that.\u2019  So I can think about service and quality - not spend my time on thinking \u2018I have to buy\u2019.  You just buy it and then you\u2019re set.\u201d\r\n\r\nWithout this loan, Ricardo thinks his business would continue to function, but it would have delayed their goals.  \r\n\r\nRicardo and his wife would like to be able to support more people.  \u201cWe want to give employment to people \u2013 to sustain many families.  That\u2019s always what we\u2019ve had in mind.  We don\u2019t want to be rich; we would rather make it so people have something they can live off of.  We would also like to be very organized, and expand.  It\u2019s been a dream for many years to have many offices in other cities.\u201d\r\n\r\nAbout two years ago, Ricardo and Marielos moved the business out of their garage.  \u201cThese have been the two most difficult years for the economy, but we\u2019ve grown!  It\u2019s a blessing for us.  The most difficult times are when you can put yourself to the test and prove your potential.\u201d\r\n\r\nThat success is also passed on to his children. \u201cI\u2019m proud that people recognize my business every time as having high quality and good service. And of the lessons that it leaves for my children \u2013 it\u2019s important.  When you have your own business, your horizon is very large.  Every day is an opportunity to do business.  And the children learn that way of thinking.\u201d\r\n\r\nRicardo has three children. Ricky is in his third year of studying civil engineering, Odette plans to study architecture when she goes to college next year, and Dhais is in high school.\r\n\r\nBorn in Chicago, Ricardo grew up in Monterrey, Mexico.  He returned to the United States 11 years ago.\r\n\r\nRicardo describes himself as a very honest family man with a lot of faith. He said he \u201cgives thanks to God for what I\u2019m living.  That my business is successful.  That everything is going well with the business and with my marriage.\u201d\r\n\r\nRicardo describes his marriage and business as \u201ca partnership where each of us do what we know best how to do.  She knows how to manage money.  And I know well how to do the work with high quality.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe advice Ricardo would like to give to other business owners is to \u201cmake the client feel like this business is for them; make them feel comfortable.  It doesn\u2019t matter if the business is tiny or huge; treat them well.  You never know which small business will grow huge, and if you treat them well when they\u2019re small they\u2019ll stick with you.\u201d

At present she attends fellowships in CCT as a Community Partner and enjoys the company of her grandchildren as she lives in Bagong Silang, a barangay of Caloocan City located on the islands of Luzon.\r\n<p>\r\nTarsing sells vegetables, meat, fish, and fruits to the community and has become an advocate for healthy eating by doing so. She starts early in the morning, offering products that are fresh and healthy. Every month, she earns an estimated net income of around 10,000 PHP.\r\n<p>\r\nTo help her grow her business, Tarcisia is requesting a 15,000 PHP loan. She plans to use this to buy more fresh supplies of meat and vegetables as well as fish and fruits. She will make sure that her products are not only fresh, but that they are also varied so as to allow more options for her customers. Tarsing also intends to add frozen foods to her goods for sale.\r\n<p>\r\nAs a local vender, Tarsing feels the weight of exhaustion and lack of sleep. Nevertheless, she is always ready to serve her fellow community members by offering and encouraging them to buy healthy foods. She wants her business to become well established and have more regular customers. She looks forward to abundant blessings from the Lord so that she may be able to help her grandchildren.\r\n<p>\r\nAs a CCT community partner, she faithfully attends their weekly fellowship meetings where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she receives.\r\n<p>\r\nAbout CCT:\r\n<p>\r\nThe Center for Community Transformation (CCT) is an organized Christian response against poverty and social injustice. This is carried out through the fusion of social development initiatives and evangelical missionary work in a uniquely Filipino context. It serves urban and rural poor communities throughout the Philippines in pursuit of its desire to see changed lives, strong families, and transformed communities centered in the Lordship of Jesus Christ. CCT is a member of the Five Talents family.\r\n<p>\r\nLocally, all CCT community partners and clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital and pay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":700317,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

The people in this area farm and raise livestock.\r\n\r\nM\u00f3nica raises and sells poultry (hens, ducks and turkeys).  The pen where she keeps her animals is located outside her home.  She feeds her animals a balanced diet and natural grains.  She then sells her animals in the different markets in the city of Chiclayo once they have reached an ideal size and weight.  This increases her profits and she is able to obtain things that her household lacks.  M\u00f3nica also has a small store in her home since there isn't one in the village where she lives.  This makes her another income.\r\n\r\nM\u00f3nica has requested a loan for 1,200 Peruvian soles from Edpyme Alternativa through their seed fund.  She will use this money to buy poultry and some products with which to stock her store.  This will enable her to repay her loan and improve her family's quality of life.  M\u00f3nica is a hard-working person with a lot of drive who has known how to get ahead in order to improve her business and also her family life."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":775195,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy poultry and some products with which to stock her store","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"P\u00edtipo - Chiclayo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":143,"posted_date":"2011-06-02T22:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":450,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":" Monica Santos","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-05-04T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1200,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":83.95},{"due_date":"2011-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":85.45},{"due_date":"2011-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":89.41},{"due_date":"2011-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":89.24},{"due_date":"2011-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":97.02},{"due_date":"2011-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":97.49},{"due_date":"2011-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":100.03},{"due_date":"2012-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":105.29},{"due_date":"2012-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":107.59},{"due_date":"2012-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":111.18},{"due_date":"2012-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":115.4},{"due_date":"2012-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":117.95}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.48},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.05},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.52},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.47},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.38},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.56},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.51},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39.49},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.34},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.69},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.28},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.23}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":31.48,"local_amount":83.95,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T10:53:19Z","rounded_local_amount":86.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216489672},{"amount":32.05,"local_amount":85.45,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-19T07:45:12Z","rounded_local_amount":88.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":222205795},{"amount":33.52,"local_amount":89.41,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-16T08:02:58Z","rounded_local_amount":92.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227182554},{"amount":33.47,"local_amount":89.24,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T08:44:39Z","rounded_local_amount":92.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232779515},{"amount":36.38,"local_amount":97.02,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T09:48:19Z","rounded_local_amount":100.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238584066},{"amount":36.56,"local_amount":97.49,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-04T09:09:20Z","rounded_local_amount":100.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244542249},{"amount":37.51,"local_amount":100.03,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-02T09:04:47Z","rounded_local_amount":103.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250752806},{"amount":39.49,"local_amount":105.29,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-24T08:41:54Z","rounded_local_amount":108.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257394845},{"amount":169.54,"local_amount":452.12,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:12:13Z","rounded_local_amount":466.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263290306}],"funded_date":"2011-06-03T15:22:32Z","paid_date":"2012-03-15T09:12:13Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Oxnard","image":null}},{"id":305139,"name":"Tattygul's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Tattygul, 24, is the leader of this group.

Apart from selling jewelry and catalogue items, she also makes clay crafts and ceramics to sell.\r\n\r\nFor the past four years she has been selling items from catalogues.  She tells us that this has gone very well, and that she also buys clothes and resells them.  In the patio of her house she has a small room where she keeps her materials to make her clay and ceramic crafts.  She intends to invest the funds from this loan in merchandise for her catalogue sales, since she has a number of orders and for lack of capital has not been able to fulfill them.\r\n\r\nLittle by little she has taught herself how to make the crafts that she makes today.  She sells her crafts from the room that she has.  She keeps it orderly and clean since this is where her customers come and see her crafts and the items she offers from the catalogues.\r\n\r\nPatricia gets up very early.   She does her household chores, and during the day she sells her merchandise, and at night she paints her crafts.  She is a woman who has made great progress through her own efforts.
