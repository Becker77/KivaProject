Since the move, she has been running a small business selling clothes. In 2008, she rented a small stall in the local clothing market and started selling women\u2019s and men's clothing.\r\n\r\nChantsal usually purchases clothing from Ereen, a Chinese border town from which many products are imported. She travels to Ereen to buy her inventory once or twice a month, depending on her sales volume.\r\n\r\nChantsal\u2019s hope is to see her daughters finish college without any financial strain.

His goal is to grow his business and to continue to support his children so that they can have a better future.\r\n<p>\r\nIn the photo that accompanies this profile, Thomas is the one holding the sign.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":527571,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Hardware","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To buy more cutlasses, nails, locks, and keys","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"LR","country":"Liberia","town":"Monrovia North","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"6.5 -9.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":141,"posted_date":"2010-04-21T13:40:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Tenneh","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Harus","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Thomas","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Laurintin","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-04-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"LRD","disbursal_amount":22000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":909},{"due_date":"2010-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":1623},{"due_date":"2010-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":1623},{"due_date":"2010-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1623},{"due_date":"2010-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":1623},{"due_date":"2010-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1623},{"due_date":"2010-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1623},{"due_date":"2010-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1623},{"due_date":"2010-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1623},{"due_date":"2010-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1623},{"due_date":"2010-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1623},{"due_date":"2010-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":1623},{"due_date":"2010-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1623},{"due_date":"2010-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1615}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.43},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.97},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.98},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.98},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.97},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.98},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.98},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.97},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.98},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.97},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.98},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.98},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.97},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.86}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":91.07,"local_amount":6165,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-17T07:50:24Z","rounded_local_amount":6306.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144998172},{"amount":119.66,"local_amount":8100,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-21T07:43:15Z","rounded_local_amount":8286.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":152755746},{"amount":114.27,"local_amount":7735,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:32:52Z","rounded_local_amount":7912.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159667068}],"funded_date":"2010-04-21T23:07:50Z","paid_date":"2010-08-15T11:32:52Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Aya Padr\u00f3n","image":275073}},{"id":198694,"name":"Meiry","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Nuestra socia pertenece al banco comunal \u201cVIRGEN INMACULADA CONCEPCI\u00d3N\u201d; Nuestra socia vive en el distrito de Anta provincia de Anta departamento de Cusco.\n\nNuestra socia es la  Sra.

Casi sin descanso, labora a diario, en su chacra, en busca de un futuro mejor para sus hijos; pues continua apoy\u00e1ndoles econ\u00f3micamente, es por eso que desde muy temprano empieza su jornada laboral, en donde cuenta con hect\u00e1reas extensas donde produce caf\u00e9, pl\u00e1tano, frutas c\u00edtricas, cacao y achiote. En ocasiones recibe la ayuda de su hijo, quien inspecciona cuidadosamente las plantaciones. Lo que m\u00e1s le gusta a Roberto, es retirar la maleza de sus chacras y as\u00ed mantenerlos limpios, tambi\u00e9n le agrada poner trampas para que los animales no malogren sus cosechas y las pueda vender a buenos precios en el mercado de su ciudad, porque los frutos que produce son muy requeridos y por tal considera que su actividad es muy rentable. En adelante quiere ser uno de los mejores productores de cacao, bananas y caf\u00e9 para poder obtener mayores utilidades que le favorezcan.

He lives in his own house with two of his four children.  He has been separated from his wife for three years, although he is still dependent on her.  Almost without rest, he works every day in his small farm, in search of a better future for his children, as he continues to support them economically.  It is for this reason he begins his daily work very early, in which he has extensive hectares where he produces coffee, bananas, citrus fruits, cocoa, and annatto (makes a red paste used in cooking for color and flavor).\r\n<p>\r\nOn occasion he receives the help of his son, who carefully inspects the plants.  What Roberto likes most is to pull out the weeds from his farm and likewise keep them clean.  Also he likes to put traps out so that the animals don't spoil his harvests, and he can sell them at good prices in the market in his city.  The fruits that he produces are highly demanded and as such, he considers his business very profitable.  Going forward, he wants to be one of the biggest producers of cocoa, bananas and coffee in order to be able to earn greater profits.  \r\n<p>\r\nThis is his second loan with MFP and he is sure that he can complete each payment punctually, as he did with his first loan.  Additionally, he likes to work with his commnity bank.  With the loan he is requesting, he will invest it in the purchase of banana plants to plant them in three hectares of land that he recently bought.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Amy McGinty, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":552373,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy banana plants","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-06-13T10:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":225,"lender_count":6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Roberto ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-06-03T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":600,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-29T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":600}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":225}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":64.99,"local_amount":173.3,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:38:11Z","rounded_local_amount":185.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201326806},{"amount":160.01,"local_amount":426.7,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:33:26Z","rounded_local_amount":455.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206196535}],"funded_date":"2010-06-13T18:37:36Z","paid_date":"2011-05-15T11:33:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Amy McGinty","image":348203}},{"id":210983,"name":"Mrs. Yan Yorng Village Bank Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Yan Y. is a 29 year old married woman.

Her husband, M. Y., buys fresh fruits from the fruit markets at cheap rates and then sells them in different areas of the community from his four-wheel cart. People come to buy fruits from him because of their freshness and good quality. With the loan, he will buy fresh seasonal fruits in bulk quantities and increase his sales. Nasreen is confident that this loan investment will be beneficial for her husband and for the family, and that he will be able to lift up his business successfully by increasing his sales to many more customers. \r\n \r\nThey have three sons, two of whom work. The youngest, age 15, still lives at home. The family lives in a city named Sahiwal in Pakistan. Nasreen and her husband couldn\u2019t provide education facilities to her children due to their limited financial resources. The children left their school after completing fifth grade.\r\n \r\nNasreen is a regular loan user of Asasah and this is her fourth loan application.

L. is a married woman who lives in Purok 2, Brgy. Media Once, Toledo City, Cebu. She earns her living by operating two business ventures:  Cake Processing and Food Vending. Her husband Camilo L., who is 59 years old, works as a mechanic to earn his living. They have two children who are 24 and 30 years old. Virgenia joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2002 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 16 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Virgenia has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 11,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 10,000, improving the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 17th loan, she is borrowing PHP 15,000, which she intends to use for additional working capital so that she can continue to save up for future renovation of their house. Virgenia L. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

F. was born in 1967. He is married and the father of four children, all below the age of 15.  He and his family share three rooms in Njianga Quarters, in Nsongwa village mile 90 Bamenda, North West Region, Cameroon.\r\n\r\n<p>E. has encountered a lot of difficulties in life, the most profound being the death of his parents while he was still very young. As a result, he was unable to educate himself nor to have three square meals a day. Ill health has also been one of his problems. He has been unable to have good medical treatment because he has no money. Since he has joined GHAPE, he has seen the following changes in his life: sending his children to school, affording three square meals a day for his family, encouraging capital for his business and paying his hospital bills without a lot of difficulty.\r\n\r\n<p>With this loan of 200,000 XAF, E. will increase his capital and buy farm tools, piglets and pig feed. The manure from the pigs will be used to farm vegetables, some of which he will sell. His community and family will benefit from the vegetables, manure and meat when the pigs are edible. His activity will help reduce distance from members of his community and will be available at all times. E. says, \u201cMy children will all be well educated.\u201d He will use the profit from his business to educate his children, increase his capital and provide basic needs for himself and for his family. He prefers GHAPE because of the training and follow-up he frequently receives. He appreciates that GHAPE does not ask for collateral securities and that it provides low cost loans, with gradual payments.\r\n\r\nAbout GHAPE \r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon.  GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach.  Every client is trained in business management, basic health, life skills, financial management, profits and losses, and family values.  Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement.  GHAPE instills a sense of family and community within its clients and staff and has developed a strong bond of trust between the organization and its clients.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":689892,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

For the past three years, Beatrice has been working hard to manage her retail shop, which sells soap and sugar. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Beatrice has requested a loan of 400,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to purchase cooking oil, baking flour, soap and sugar for resale. This will help Beatrice to generate greater profits and improve her family's quality of life. Beatrice hopes that in the future she will be able to open up another retail shop. \r\n\r\nBeatrice is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills training. The ELA program has increased Beatrice's future prospects by helping her to improve her business.

She is also responsible for supporting two other dependants, because one is orphan and the other has parents, but they cannot take care for him. \n\nNeema buys crops from farmers and brings them at town where she can sell them at higher price. Neema  has been running her crop business since 2007. \n\nShe works at her business for 9-12 hours per day, 6 days per week and is assisted by her husband.

Neema thanks you for your support!\n\nABOUT SELFINA:\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

M.. \r\nThis group is from the Las Flores region in the Masaya municipality. The three members are involved in the same business activity: fruit and vegetable sales. They sell their produce at the Masaya municipal market. They have been in this business for many years, and they have been working with Adim for several loan cycles, demonstrating that they are punctual and responsible people. They are committed to be in good standing with the institute. \r\nMs. Celia Mar\u00eda is a young mother of two young children. She buys and sells fruit at the market very early in the morning. She learned this skill from her mother, who is in the same line of work even today. She is pleased to have obtained loans based on trust. She dreams of being able to give her children an education and a better quality of life. \r\nMs. Aura Lila G. has been a hard-worker since she was young. She is raising her young son on her own. As a single mother, she has become strong enough to work and help her son get ahead in life. He is a student at the local school, and she thinks that he will be able to attend secondary school in Masaya. \r\nMs. Lilliam del Socorro C. is the group coordinator. She was given this post because she can read more then the other members, and can sign her name well. She has been working at the market from a young age alongside her mother. She sells fruits and vegetables. She has invested this loan, she has been able to invest her own money and now has her own stand in which she sells oranges, lemons, tamarind, onions, garlic, etc. She purchase these products at the market, then sells them in her area of residence. \r\nShe has four school age children\u2014three adolescents and one child\u2014who study at their local school. One of her children studies in Masaya because she feels that he should leave the region and take extra courses. Her work schedule begins at 3 a.m. and ends at 2 p.m. When she returns home, she takes groceries. She states that the loan allows her to purchase a greater amount of fruit, which yields her greater profits. \r\nShe motivates her colleagues to be in good stand and keep borrowing so that they can continue to grow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Elizabeth Casian, Kiva

She is married and has seven children. Two of her children are in school, while the rest are learning trades. She has been in food provision for over six years now. She understands customer ethics and is also aware that customers mean cash; for that reason, she does not down play on quality and excellent service. <p>\r\n\r\nShe prepares and sells local foods like fufu, banku and other local dishes. Fufu is prepared from pounded cassava and plantain, taken with all kinds of soup. Banku is prepared from milled maize grains and it is taken with hot pepper or soup.

For the past two years she has crafted knapsacks (an accessory used by the local farmers to carry their lunch and eating utensils during their work periods) and woven tablecloths.  She tells us that she had to start this line of work because the income her husband earned as a farmer was insufficient to meet the family's basic needs.  Mar\u00eda works based on orders she gets from her neighbors and from residents of adjacent settlements.  To make a single knapsack takes her 20 days.  Her business has been growing and she wants to expand it even more but lacks sufficient funds to buy the necessary supplies so she is requesting funds, for the first time from Edpyme Alternativa, in the form of a 1000 new sol loan, which will be used to buy thread, wool and flannel in order to reach her goal.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She has been married to Hober Salom\u00f3n since she was 18, and she\u2028has 8 children. Four of them are students and the other four have independent jobs.  She buys animals and sells their meat, and thanks to Banco\u2028Progresistas (a local bank), she learned to be independent and run the business alone instead of depending on her husband as she did before. When she received her first loan of 300 soles, she invested\u2028it very carefully.  She bought pigs, made a profit, and went on to working alone. She was able to repay the loan in four months. With this loan of 1,500 soles, to be repaid in four installments, she will buy a cow and retail sell its meat.  She works for the local soup\u2028kitchen Coraz\u00f3n de Mar\u00eda and is member of the Banco\u2028Comunal Progesistas.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n<P>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n<P>\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is 41 years old, married, and the mother of 5 children between 24 and 31 years old.  3 of her children attend university and the others are employed.  She is responsible for her niece who lives with her in her house.  She is not able to save any money because she has to pay for her children's university expenses; she has do to this as her husband lost his job after having problems at work.\r\n\r\nDue to the lack of financial means, Ticana had to discontinue her studies in the 8th grade.  Years later, she left Manhi\u00e7a for Marracuene with her husband due to his job as Agriculture Director in that District where he governed for 5 years.  Because Ticana had level of schooling that was deemed adequate, the administrator invited her to work as his secretary.  However, he husband was transferred to the town of Namaacha on the border with Swaziland; she wasn't able to have a separate professional and family life, so she left her job.  After she arrived in Namaacha, she used the money that she had collected to start a business raising baby chicks.  She counts on the help of her husband, who is an expert agronomist.  Besides this business, she is also the owner of a meal stand.  The chicks require a lot of attention; she doesn't have a fixed schedule.  She raises at most 5 boxes with 100 chicks each, spending 40,000 MZN.  She resells each box for 100 MZN.  She has raised them in different stages in order to alternate her sales.  Her best product that she sells in her meal stand is already-cooked chicken.  From her stand, she makes of monthly profit of 10,000 MZN.\r\n\r\nThis is Ticana's 3rd loan with Hluvuku and her second with Kiva.  The first loan was for 15,000 MZN, which she used to buy chicks.  The second loan of 12,000 MZN was used to reinforce her chick-raising business.  She has asked for this third loan of 20,000 MZN for the same purpose.  She is confident that she can pay off the loan before the deadline arrives, as she is also an employee of CMVN (Municipal Council) in addition to being a businesswoman.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated

Two of her children have been to high school.  \r\n\r\nThis is a family that lives from agriculture and raising cattle.  They have a good location near Kivu lake where there is always pasture even during the dry season.  Mrs. M. received a loan from Amasezerano Community Banking in 2009 to buy a cow of a better breed.  Thanks to her investment, she has paid the tuition fees for her two children and put flooring in her house, which had a dirt floor before.  She hopes to acquire 10 better breed cows in the future because these are more profitable than local cows and produce milk, which improves nutrition.

He has had difficulties in raising capital to start up a small business to sustain him and his family. He plans to invest this loan in a gardening business, and with this loan he is going to buy seedlings and farm products. He believes the business will succeed because the previous loan he took was repaid by the income raised from an old farm of his; therefore, he concludes that he is sure the business will succeed. He is also certain that this business will succeed because the products he produces are highly demanded in the market. The loan will help his community because they will be able to afford all food ingredients at low or no cost. \r\n\r\nAnye will plough back his profit into his business and use part to care for his family.

D. is a single woman who lives in Brgy. Tan-awan, Oslob, Cebu.  She earns her living by operating fish vending and livestock businesses. Rosenda joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2004 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 12 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Rosenda has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 19,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 8,400, uplifting the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 13th loan, she is borrowing PHP 18,000, which she intends to use for additional capital for the business so that she can continue to save up for future house repair. Rosenda D. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams.

She works on Tuesdays and Saturdays, from 6.00am to 3.00pm.  The second week of each month (when people are paid) and the end of each month are the times when she sells most merchandise.  Her brother helps her to transport her merchandise between the market and her house.  She used to work selling second-hand clothes but that business didn't make good enough profits.\r\n\r\nGricel buys her merchandise from a tool distributor's which means that her investment is low cost.

He lives in the Tsovagyugh village in the Syunik region together with his wife and three children.  Andranik's daughters attend a school, and son goes to kindergarten.  Andranik is involved in agriculture and, parallel to that, sales of products and household goods.  His farm includes 3 cows, 2 calves and 20 chickens.  He has been selling food products and household goods for 10 years at a small wagon, which is located in close proximity to his home.  His wife helps him with the sales.  Thanks to their business and farm, they can support their family.  Andranik needs a loan in the sum of 800,000 dram to expand the assortment of his wagon-store, especially to buy an inventory of pasta, canned goods, sunflower oil and also a large inventory of laundry detergents and cleaning supplies.  Andranik plans to use the future profit to build a new store for his retail business.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2175,"image":{"id":885669,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

Correa lives in Ciudad del Este with his wife Antolina and his two children. <p>\r\nMany years ago, Santiago started working in a bookstore called Cassol, where he gained experience in the field. Tired of being an employee, he decided to open his own bookstore in the shopping center of Ciudad del Este. Santiago sells articles used in writing such as paper, pens, quills, inkstands, pencils, and blank books. It is worth mentioning that the store is located in a strategic place, because Ciudad del Este is a commercial city. Usually Paraguayans go to Ciudad del Este only to buy things; from electronic devices to clothes. <p>\r\n\r\nBesides the bookstore, Santiago owns a grocery store.

The residents of Santa Cruz have the good fortune of waking up each day and experiencing the beauty of the lake at first sight.  This town is divided between the indigenous residents, who live their lives in a very traditional way, and a group of expatriates who are currently investing a great deal in the tourism industry.\r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe women of Santa Cruz used to live in absolute poverty and without much hope of getting ahead, until a few years ago when \u201cGringa Lil\u201d began to organize women together to request loans from microfinance institutions.  Thanks to the efforts of this industry the town began to grow.  This is how the Friendship Bridge began operations in Santa Cruz. \r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\nAll of the women work with textiles.  Half of the group work as weavers of huipiles (typical blouses) and rebosos (scarves), while the other half work as embroiderers.  They embroider the huipiles or beautiful colorful blouses.  They reinvest their profits in the purchase of threads to weave or embroider their fabrics.\r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe Elenas de la Cruz sell their products in the market of their town.  They also sell in neighboring towns.  The interesting thing is that from Santa Cruz to other potential markets like Jaibalito and Tzununa, one can only reach them by boat.  The ladies load their baskets with merchandise and then proceed to carry the baskets on their heads to the boats which carry them to neighboring towns.\r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\nThis group of women would like to continue investing in their businesses, because they want their businesses to grow in order to continue helping their families.  They dream that their children will be able to continue going to school all the way to graduation.  You can help them reach their dreams.

Los pobladores de Santa Cruz tienen la fortuna de poder levantarse todos los d\u00edas y experimentar la belleza del lago a primera vista. Este pueblo est\u00e1 dividido entre los pobladores ind\u00edgenas, los cuales viven sus vidas de una manera muy tradicionales y un grupo de expatriados que actualmente est\u00e1n invirtiendo mucho en la industria del turismo. \r\n\r\n<P>Las mujeres de Santa Cruz viv\u00edan en la pobreza absoluta y sin mucha esperanza de salir adelante, hasta que hace unos cuantos a\u00f1os la \u201cgringa Lil\u201d empez\u00f3 a juntar a mujeres para que solicitaran pr\u00e9stamos a las instituciones de microfinanzas. Gracias a este esfuerzo esta industria empez\u00f3 a crecer en este bello pueblo. As\u00ed fue como The Friendship Bridge empez\u00f3 operaciones en Santa Cruz. \r\n\r\n<P>Todas las mujeres trabajan en el \u00e1rea textil. La mitad del grupo trabaja como tejedoras de huipiles (blusas t\u00edpicas) y rebosos (pa\u00f1uelos), mientras que la otra mitad trabaja como bordadoras. Ellas bordan los huipiles o bellas blusas de colores. Ellas invierten su cr\u00e9dito en la compra de hilos para tejer o bordar sus tejidos. \r\n\r\n<P>Las Elenas de la Cruz venden sus productos en el mercado de su pueblo. Ellas, tambi\u00e9n venden sus productos en los pueblos aleda\u00f1os. Lo interesante es que de Santa Cruz a los otros mercados potenciales como Jaibalito y Tzununa solo se puede llegar por lancha. Las se\u00f1oras arman sus canastos con mercader\u00eda y proceden a cargar los canastos en sus cabezas hasta las lanchas las cuales la llevan hasta los mercados de los pueblos aleda\u00f1os. \r\n\r\n<P>Este grupo de se\u00f1oras quieren seguir invirtiendo en sus negocios porque ellas quieren que sus negocios puedan seguir creciendo para seguir ayudando a sus familias.

There is electricity, but no piped water at her home. The family gets three meals a day.

The need to support her son made her start selling animals.  Usually she goes to sell them twice a week in the city of Chiclayo.  She also sometimes sells to businesspeople who frequent the area.  She hopes to expand her business.  She tells us that some neighbors have offered to sell her animals, and she wants to buy them, but she doesn't have enough capital to do this.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

of Ngh\u1ec7 An. In 2003 she contracted a loan of 200 USD. She used this money to buy a calf. After 4 months, she sold the calf for 250 USD. The profit from selling the calf was a big motivation factor for her to continue. She contracted another loan after that to start businesses of pig raising  and liquor making. The liquor making business brings in 2.5 USD daily. With this revenue, Mrs \u0110\u1ea1t repaid the loan and the daily expenses. The waste from her liquor making is used to feed her pigs, this helps cut the cost of pig food. Running both businesses in parallel is quite convenient, it helps reduce considerably the time it takes raising the pigs. Mrs \u0110\u1ea1t is requesting a loan of 325 USD. With this loan she would buy 8 breeding pigs and a peep of egg laying chickens. Selling the eggs would bring in enough revenue to pay her weekly expenses. For the pigs she hopes to sell them in the new year, this would bring in 500 USD. \r\n\r\n<P><B>Translated from Vietnamese by Khang Ho-Si, Kiva volunteer<P><\/b>\r\n\r\nN\u0103m nay 44 tu\u1ed5i, ch\u1ecb \u0110\u1eb7ng Th\u1ecb \u0110\u1ea1t s\u1ed1ng c\u00f9ng ch\u1ed3ng v\u00e0 5 ng\u01b0\u1eddi con t\u1ea1i Nghi L\u1ed9c, Ngh\u1ec7 An.

Despite having two businesses, her daily income is not enough to make her business grow. \r\n\r\n<p><p>\r\nHence, Tessia is requesting a loan amounting to PHP7, 000.00 for additional capital. She would like to purchase products for her manicurist and beautician business, such as hot oils for her customer\u2019s hair and hair relaxing chemicals.  With the loan she will be able to increase the services offered to her customers and increase business, helping her provide for her children\u2019s

loans purposely for business expansion and making good profits.  Hochi is 53 years old, and she is a mother of four adult children.  Her husband works at a pressure station and earns a minimum income of only 270 somoni or 55 dollars per month, and this is why the business brings in an additional income for the family.  The family has an average living minimum.  Hochi's youngest daughter, Nigora, helps her with the business.  Hochi's place of business is located among the rows of women's purses sales at the central Panshanbe market.

She begins her workday early each day at 5:00 a.m., and she buys fruits and vegetables from local farmers and thereafter sells such produce in the market.

people who plan to use the loan for different purposes. Mrs. Sok S. has been selected by the members as the village bank president. She is 47 years old, and the mother of two children who attend the local school. She is a farmer who owns a one hectare rice field. She faces a small problem in her plantation, because her field is now infertile. In order to solve this problem, Mrs. Sok S. is requesting a loan to buy fertilizers in order to make her field and crops more productive. Her husband, Mr. Taing Than, is a teacher who earns roughly $50 per month, but this is not enough income to support their family. \r\n\r\n<p>This is a village bank loan consisting mainly of end-of-term loans. Four members have end-of-term loans, and the rest have monthly payment loans. End-of-term (EoT) loans are AMK's main product, because they are the most beneficial to Cambodia's poor. This type of loan allows them to repay portions of the principal whenever they are financially able to do so. These members are not required to pay any principal on the loan until the very end of the loan term; but most clients start to make payments many months before the end of the loan term. Almost all of AMK's clients make their payments on time. AMK has a delinquency rate of only 0.09%, and AMK has a 0% default rate on Kiva loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2175,"image":{"id":207089,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy fertilizers in order to make her rice field and crops more productive.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":825,"image":{"id":237945,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To renovate her office","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbarali","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.433333 34.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-12-16T05:20:44Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":825,"lender_count":31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rhoida S.

For the last three years he has been a part-owner of a restaurant that specializes in roast chicken, also working in the restaurant with his sister.  He is responsible for roasting the chickens and frying the potatoes while she waits on the customers.  Jorge is very satisfied with this work because the business is independent and stable.  He also really likes to see his customers enjoy the golden chicken and crispy potatoes that he makes.  The business is very profitable, since this kind of chicken restaurant is very popular in any neighborhood in his town.  Jorge's dream for the future is to own his own chicken restaurant, where all of the profits will go to him and his family.  This is his fifth loan with MFP.  What he enjoys about working with his community bank is that everyone is very united and responsible with their payments.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.
