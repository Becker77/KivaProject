She lives with her husband and their child in Wayerma II, a popular neighborhood in Sikasso (third administrative region of the Republic of Mali). Mrs. Assanatou D. is a trained teacher who also runs a small shop outside her home, where she's been reselling various articles (cigarettes, candies, matches, chewing gum, powdered milk, tea, sugar, etc) for ten years. She's much in demand thanks to the quality of her products. \r\n\r\nTo meet an ever-increasing customer demand, she decided to join the microfinance organization Soro Yiriwaso five years ago. After several solidarity loans (group loans) with other women of her neighborhood, she's now seeking her fifth individual commercial loan (PIC loan). All previous loans were repaid without problems. With this new loan, she intends to buy 5 cartons of diverse brands of cigarettes, 1 box of tea, 1 sack of sugar, 10 packs of candies, 10 packs of chewing gums, 20 packs of cigarettes, etc. Mrs. Assanatou D. sells her products for cash or on credit to a clientele of neighbors. She purchases the goods she retails from wholesalers in Sikasso. With this loan, she anticipates turning a monthly profit of XOF 80'000 (ca. US$ 160), to be mainly used to help with the family expenses and to repay the loan. The remainder will be invested in her business.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Patrick Stadelmann, Kiva

Having reached the age of 58, Apal can surely consider herself a happy woman as she has raised five children. All of them, except one son, already have their own families and live separately. Her eldest son is 40 and the youngest daughter is 24.\r\n<p>\r\nNevertheless, Apal and her husband have preferred a shed and a busy daily routine of looking after cattle rather than a comfortable living room where they could sing a lullaby to their grandchildren. Always used to hard work and the smell of cattle, Apal and her husband are still working. They keep their own household. They are occupied with livestock raising and milk sales. These have been the main source of their sustenance for forty years.\r\n<p>\r\nRaising cattle has allowed them to successfully bring up the children not depending on government allowances or benefits. Selling milk alone provides them with a monthly income of $40. Whenever meat is needed, they always have cattle available for their needs.\r\n<p>\r\nApal has applied for this loan and hopes that by means of this loan, she will be able to buy a milk cow and sell more milk. Her immediate plans are to conduct some repair work at home and see her son married. \r\n\r\nApal has three partners: Jenishai, Tolkunai and Burulkan.  Jenishai, 34, has three children. To provide for the family, her husband works as a carpenter. Jenisha, in her turn, trades in clothing. Jenishai learned to sell clothes from her sister. Now she has become an independent entrepreneur.  Jenishai needs a loan to purchase goods. \r\n\r\nTolkunai, 34, has three children. Tolkunai manufactures traditional items at her house and sells them in the capital. Her husband is a welder. Making national articles brings her $120. Tolkunai wants to sell more articles, so she has applied for the loan to purchase more fabric and threads.\r\n\r\nBurulkan, 49, has two daughters. Both of her daughters have married and live separately. Burulkan\u2019s husband is engaged in trading in cattle, mainly sheep. Burulkan sells women's gowns. Burulkan hopes to obtain this loan to purchase goods.\r\n \r\n<b>======================================\r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---<\/b>\r\n<p>\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance, a young and ambitious socially-focused MFI in Kyrgyzstan.\r\nMol Bulak Finance is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development on the basis of the 3-Ps concept: People (building human capital and taking care of its customers and the society as well), Profit (to be profitable in order to grow further), and the Planet (taking care of the environment).

Tambi\u00e9n se dedica  a la reposter\u00eda, pero solo por encargos, como por ejemplo tortas, kuchenes, etc.\n\nCuando viaja a comprar su mercader\u00eda a Santiago, aprovecha de llevar para vender queso, harina tostada y merqu\u00e9n, para de esta manera aprovechar sus contactos y aumentar sus ingresos.\n\nLiliana invertir\u00e1 este pr\u00e9stamo en quesos y en la ropa de moda esta temporada.\n\nSu meta es arrendar una tienda, en donde pueda vender ropa de ni\u00f1o y adulto, y su gran sue\u00f1o es ser enfermera, lo que estudiar\u00eda sin dudar si tuviera la oportunidad.\n\nLo que m\u00e1s le gusta a Liliana de trabajar con Fondo Esperanza es la unidad del grupo y la relaci\u00f3n con la Asesora, lo que la hace sentir importante y valorada.\n\nLiliana tiene 7 hijos, de los cuales 4 viven con ellos, por lo que se siente muy bien, apoyada y acompa\u00f1ada.\n\nTemuco is the capital of the Araucan\u00eda region. It is located 670 kilometres south of Santiago (the capital of Chile) and possesses a series of lake-side spa resorts and striking native flora and fauna. This region is also noteworthy for being the region where 50% of Chile's existing indigenous Mapuche community live; some of whom are members of Fondo Esperanza communal banks.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","en":"This communal bank is called \u201cJazmines de Los Lagos\u201d, and this is the second time they have had a loan published on Kiva.  This communal bank comes from the city of Temuco, and the members dedicated themselves primarily to the businesses of carpentry, bicycle repairs, sewing, preparing lunches, selling used clothes, selling French fries, and selling cigarettes.\r\n\r\nThe group member we interviewed was Liliana, who is the bank\u2019s secretary.  You see her in the picture in the center of the second row with short hair, to the right of the man with the blue jacket.  Liliana dedicates herself to door-to-door sales of undergarments and clothing for children and adults.  She also makes desserts by special order, things like cakes and pastries.\r\n\r\nWhen Liliana travels to Santiago to purchase merchandise she makes the most of her trip by bringing items from Temuco to sell in Santiago.  She brings cheese, wheat products, and spicy peppers, thereby taking advantage of the contacts she has in Santiago and increasing her earnings.\r\n\r\nLiliana will invest this loan in cheese and in clothes that are in fashion for this season (fall\/winter).\r\n\r\nHer goal is to rent store space to establish her clothing-sales business, and her big dream is to be a nurse \u2013 she would, without a doubt, study to be a nurse if she had the chance.\r\n\r\nThe part Liliana likes most about working with Fondo Esperanza is the group unity and their relationship with their loan officer, a relationship which makes them feel important and valued.\r\n\r\nLiliana also feels very much supported and accompanied by her seven children, four of whom still live with her.\r\n\r\nTemuco is the capital of the Araucan\u00eda region.

Her older children are grown. For the last five years, Lucinda sells food right outside of her home. With great effort and hard work, she was able to build Internet cabins, a business her daughter manages. \r\n\r\nAt her food stall, Lucinda makes snacks, and cooks hotdogs and other food items on the grill. She starts work in the afternoon, and does not stop until late at night because this is the best time for selling food. Because her clients also enjoy the convenience of having Internet access close by, Lucinda's business is booming.\r\n\r\nThis is Lucinda's first loan with Kiva partner MFP and she promises to make all her payments on time.

It has produced famous thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. A civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged an already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural productivity and the manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent viable business prospects. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

They have one child who is 17 years old and is currently going to school.  \r\n\r\nLucilita joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2008 because she aspired to something better for her family. With the help of her past seven loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Lucilita has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 18,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 15,000, thus uplifting the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her eighth cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 20,000, which she intends to use to buy feed, medicines and vaccines for her pigs and stocks for the general store so that she can continue to save up for her child's education and for future home repairs. \r\n\r\nLucilita Z. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means \"honorable\"). NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon, a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Now she sells rotisserie chicken during the week and barbecue on Sundays.  Everyone in the area has tried her exquisite and delicious barbecue.<p>\r\nNevertheless, this is the moment for Andrea's business to grow.  This is why she is requesting a credit of $475, which she is willing to repay in 6 months.

Through these loans they get from Kiva (through SMT), these entrepreneurs are able to remain in business and sustain themselves. However, they still need new loans to enable them to enhance their businesses. They are thus requesting a loan of Le 1,600,000. Kadiatu, 37, is the leader of the group. She was born in Magoreh village, seven miles from Makeni. She is married and has five children. Her husband is also a businessman. Kadiatu has sold dried fish for the past 10 years. She buys fish in a village called Tombo which is about 10 miles from Freetown.

V. is from the village of Mahinog, Camiguin. She is 39 years-old and married with two school-aged children. Roselyn owns and operates a business making and selling food. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from selling rice products and viand in the local community. Roselyn has been engaged in her business for over eight years and earns approximately 5,000 PHP a month.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2009, Roselyn joined Kiva partner HSPFI in order to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Roselyn has successfully repaid a previous loan of 8,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to purchase raw ingredients needed to make products to sell. Roselyn is requesting a new loan of 11,000 PHP which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This loan will be her third from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated to improve and expand her business. \r\n<p>\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n<p>\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n<p>\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, we created this template for our field staff to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate

T. is the group leader of a five-member group loan offered by SEDA, a Kiva field partner.  While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.  The official name of this borrowing group is Ph\u1ed1 Ch\u1edd 1 nh\u00f3m 02 (2).\r\n\r\nT. is married and has three school-aged children. To make a living, she owns and operates a business selling soft drinks in the local community.  She has been engaged in this business for over five years and earns approximately $147 a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, T. joined SEDA to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation by engaging in business activities.  She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 4.256.000 VND from SEDA.  This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell.  She is now requesting a new loan of 6.048.000 VND which will be used, as before, to purchase additional products to sell.  This will be her fourth loan from SEDA.  T. plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout the Other Borrowers in the Group:\r\n\r\n1.

This activity is very profitable because it allows him to make his assets grow to have various houses and farms.

Because her home, which is also the place her business is located, is close to the Institute of Social Security of the Atlacatl colony, she has very good sales and every evening many of the employees and patients in the hospital consume the traditional dishes that she makes, which incentivizes Cruz to continue pursuing her sales.  For this reason, she is requesting a loan to buy rice, beans, corn, some vegetables, and other products.  She also wants to buy propane gas cylinders to have a small supply available."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":610929,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

In conjunction with his job in public transportation, he also works three nights a week in a grocery store that is attached to his mother-in-law's house where he mainly stocks crates of beer.

","en":"Mar\u00eda (51 years old) is a married woman who lives with her husband and their two children, ages 18 and 24, in a neighborhood south of the city of Barranquilla.\r\n\r\nHer business is food preparation, especially snacks, appetizers and delicious pastries which are traditional foods in this region (a mixture of rice, vegetables and three types of meat in dough, wrapped in \"bijao\" leaves). She began this experience by preparing fast foods for parties, like cheese straws and small empanadas for special events like First Communions and birthdays for family members and some friends. Gradually her business grew, and now she works with better results because she has a growing customer base that she plans to expand by injecting the working capital from her Kiva loan, which is her first loan from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo. She will use it to buy equipment like a mixer and baking pans, as well as bigger amounts of raw materials to save on her purchases and translate those savings into good prices for her customers. Mar\u00eda's main dream is to have a banquet hall somewhere in a different building from her house, where everyone will come to meet her and have their group events, and where she can offer comfortable service that she can replicate.\r\n\r\nCurrently she faces a great challenge that she must resolve soon in order to fulfill her dream of growing, and that challenge is that she does not have a freezer for storing appetizers. She keeps them in a family refrigerator, and because of this she must prepare and sell her products quickly, and this makes her work less effective.

There she has a stationery store which she began in order to generate income to help with household expenses and that has now become her life\u2019s work. \n\nIn her business, Candelaria sells particulars for the home, stationary accessories and other merchandise. Her experience dates from the year 1996 in the old neighborhood she lived in and from which, once situated, she had to move to set up her business in a space in her mother\u2019s new house. There, it has done very well. She now plans to expand through financing, such as this kiva loan, which is the first loan she has had from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.\n\nShe will use the loan to buy particulars for the season of love and friendship that is approaching, which is the time when, during September, her sales begin to rise, due to the coming festivities.\n\nCandelaria\u2019s business sales are principally in cash, consequently her accounts receivable are low. This is her first loan request to an organization and with it she will initiate her credit history. \n\nHer dream is to have a large stationary store with additional services such as photocopying, document transcription, etc., but her great challenge is to fulfill her dream. For this reason, she is working persistently to achieve her goals.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":856359,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to

Thom province.  San has run a small business as a seller for years. In front of her house, there are lots of mixed products that she sells to her customers such as canned foods, groceries, packaged food etc. From this business, she can earn around $2.7USD per day.

Upon graduation, Guadalupe transformed her home into 'My Little World Childcare'. \r\n\r\nGuadalupe\u2019s daycare center is a \u2018home away from home\u2019 for the children, and she has tight bonds with the children she cares for. \u201cI love celebrating their birthdays,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s beautiful to watch them grow up. I get to see them get their first tooth and learn how to walk.\u201d Each day she tracks their eating habits, how they slept, and any unusual behavior, and makes reports to their parents. \r\n\r\nGuadalupe received a microloan from Opportunity Fund in 2007 to renovate her backyard and turn it into a better, safer play space for the children. She now has swing sets, a playhouse, and other toys, and the children spend time outside whenever possible. \u201cIf I had not received a loan from Opportunity Fund I still would have tried to make the safety improvements to my center, but they might not have been enough. I am afraid it could have been dangerous.\u201d \r\n\r\nWith a second loan through Opportunity Fund, this one for $8,000, Guadalupe will be able to purchase a computer to track her business expenses and a van to take the children on field trips to the nearby park and museums. She will also install a fence to separate her front yard from the

(ASHI), a partner MFI of KIVA in the Philippines, she immediately joined to have access to capital. With her previous loan, she bought additional fishing gear for her husband. She engages in fish vending. The income generated from their fish selling business helps in providing for their financial needs. The partnership of this couple works great so, again, she is applying for another loan worth PHP 25,000.00 pesos. She will use the funds from this loan for the construction of fish cages that her husband will maintain. They will buy materials such as fish nets, bamboo poles, and pay the labor costs for the assembly of fish cages and fingerlings to be place inside the cage. With the implementation of this plan, They will generate more profit and increase their income after only 3 months.

She is 36 years old. Mitze Marie is married and has one school-age child. To make a living, Mitze Marie owns and operates a piggery and a farm for coco production. Mitze Marie has been engaged in her business for over 15 years and earns approximately 5,000 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn February 2011, Mitze Marie joined PMPC under Barangay Official Livelihood Assistance (BOLA) program to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Mitze Marie is requesting a new loan of 40,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase fertilizers for her coco farm and feeds for her piggery. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions for her family, especially in meeting their basic needs, saving for future use, repaying loans, and educating her child.\r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model. \r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

At also sells vegetables and fish in the village when she is free from her weaving business. Mr. Thuy has been a motor taxi driver for over twenty years. At sells her finished products to a reseller, who then takes it to sell in Phnom Penh. The couple lives in an old house and needs some money to build a new house for their family. Thus, she is requesting a loan of 1200 USD to build a new house for her family."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":187424,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Weaving","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"To

They named their group By God In Power, a Krio phrase meaning \u201cby the power of God.\u201d  \r\n\r\nThey have received previous Kiva loans through SMT. Most recently, each of them received a loan of Le 500,000, which was a great help to Zainab and Adama. The loan enabled them to expand their businesses, make additional profits, and consequently improve the living condition of members of the group.  Having repaid their last loan successfully, they are each asking for Le 800,000. \r\n\r\nZainab (right) is the leader of the group. She is forty-seven years of age and was born in Makeni in northern Sierra Leone.  She is married to a teacher, and they have had five children together.  Zainab sells several items in a kiosk on Magburaka road in Makeni. Some of the items she sells include body lotions, cigarettes, biscuits, and Peak brand powder.  She has been in the business for over ten years now.\r\n\r\nWith this new loan, Zainab will expand her business. She will be able to buy items in bulk to add to her business. For example, she will now be able to buy one carton of cigarettes instead of one pack at a time.

She lives with Miguel, 33 years old, and they have 2 sons; Franco, 8 years old, and Dairon, 1 year old. The family lives together in their own house, located in the rural area of Palcamayo. The main economic activity of the people who live there is agriculture. \r\n\r\nEsther took care of her parents' farm land from the time she was a young girl, and she did so with dedication. Over time she was able to buy her own land; she now plants gladiolas, spinach, lettuce, and chamomile; it is this last one that brings in the greatest income. Because of this, for the past two years they have been making chamomile tea bags (small bags that are placed in hot water for drinking). Her process is by hand and so she is working hard so that she can make the changes to modernize and expand her business. She is sure that she will make progress with this business because the curative properties of the seed for different illnesses, such as ulcers, keep this plant in high demand. \r\n\r\nThis is her third loan with Microfinanzas Prisma and she is very happy with the success she has had. She is sure that, with the help of her communal bank, she will make her dream a reality. With the loan she will buy 2 thousand pounds of chamomile, which, added to the 2 thousand pounds she harvested, will be enough for her to process a good quantity of chamomile tea bags. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":621777,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy two thousand pounds of chamomile.

She is 63 and lives in her own home with her family.  She is the mother of 8 children who range in age from 25 to 42.  None of them is still in school.  She is also financially responsible for 2 grandchildren that live with her.  She studied through the 4th grade but didn't continue due to the lack of financial resources.  She saves 3,000 meticals a month in her bank account.\r\n\r\nShe never left Naamacha.  She started her business to try to help her family with their income.  Years later, since there is an informal market near her home, she constructed rooms to rent out to accomodate strangers that come to trade products there.  The market is held twice a week on Thursdays and Saturdays.  She makes a monthly income of 10,000 meticals.  Because her guests were eating their meals outside of her house, she started making meals to satisfy this need and also sells basic goods.  Her daughter helps her with the general management of her business and makes 3,000 meticals a month.  She saves 2,000 meticals a month in her bank.\r\n\r\nThis is her first loan with Hluvuku in the amount of 15,000 meticals, which she will use to buy basic goods to resell. (flour, juice, soup, soft drinks, and more).  She is confident that she will make her payments on time so she can request more loans.

She bought the bakery from her father-in-law in May so she can now manage it in a way that better suits her.  She makes batches of bread each night and sells what she makes in the mornings after.  She sells the bread from her house because she doesn't have a large enough shop for selling.  Luz says, \"I spend 70 soles a day buying flour, sugar and butter to make\" [a nightly batch of bread].  She says, too, that she makes back the 70 soles she spends on supplies plus another 70 soles.  \"It's very profitable\", she adds.  Her husband helps her with the business.  She also has an employee who she pays by the month to help her with the difficult and tiring work.  She and her husband rented before, but they own their own house now.  Luz's drive to get ahead knows no bounds: she is processing the paperwork to get the licenses she needs to operate the business as both a bakery and a shop.

However, it is difficult to procure fertilizer because the there are no nearby fertilizer vendors.  Seeing this condition, I made Wenten saw a business opportunity.

Khusus untuk lingkungan I Made Wenten, sebagian besar petani bercocok tanam dengan menanam padi. Hal ini disebabkan karena pengairan diwilayah tersebut mencukupi untuk menanam padi. Sebagai seorang petani, I Made Wenten paham akan kebutuhan para petani pada saat masa tanam.\r\nPetani di desa I Made Wenten sangat membutuhkan pupuk untuk meningkatkan produktifitas sawahnya. Namun yang menjadi kendala adalah sulitnya mencari pupuk karena selain jarak pedagang pupuk yang cukup jauh, ketersediaan pupuk pun sangat minim. Melihat hal ini, I Made Wenten menganggap sebagi peluang bisnis yang bisa diandalkan. Selain tetap mengerjakan sawahnya sendiri, I Made Wenten melayani penjualan beraneka jenis pupuk yang diperlukan oleh petani. Dengan pinjaman dari Dinari, I Made Wenten membeli pupuk di pedagang besar dan memasarkannya kembali. Para petani merasa sangat terbantu dengan usaha I Made Wenten, karena mereka dapat dengan mudah memperoleh pupuk. Satu hal yang sangat dihargai oleh para petani adalah layanan antar oleh I Made Wenten kepada para pembeli.

She is 28 years old and married with three children aged between 1 1\/2 and 9 years.  Two of her children go to school, and the other one is still young.  She owns a five-room house where she lives with eight people. Phiona doesn\u2019t take care of any additional family members. Her house has no electricity but there is piped water.  The family gets three meals a day. \r\n<p>\r\nPhiona resides and works in a semi-urban area on the outskirts of Kampala. Phiona sells second-hand clothes in Namungoona Market (one of the city's suburbs). She sells to an average of 20 people a day, and works six days a week. Phiona\u2019s major monthly expenses include rent for the business, school fees, and medication. She incurs extra transport costs traveling to and from Kampala to shop. She has been in this business for the last six years. \r\n<p>\r\nPhiona\u2019s main challenges are the increasing prices of goods and competition. Phiona has been with MCDT for over five years and is servicing her ninth  loan, working with the same group mates the whole time. She wants to use this loan partly to pay school fees for her children and partly to buy more clothes for resale. Phiona aspires to own a container full of second-hand clothes.\r\n.\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n

He finished the 10th grade because his parents didn't have financial resources, so he had to start working to help at home. He lives in his own house with his family and he also supports his mother in Montepuez sending her money to pay electricity, water and food.\r\n\r\nHe left Montepuez in 1979 to fulfill the military service which is obligatory in Maputo. He continues in the army and is part of the Ministry of National Defense. He earns a salary of 6.555MT and after household expenses he is able to save some money at the Commercial Bank BIM.\r\n\r\nHe learned about Hlvuku thru a co-worker so he decided to approach the institution, he doesn't have credit at other financial institutions. This is his first loan for 10.000MT, and he expects to use it to buy construction materials (nails, iron, cement, wires and metal sheets of zinc) to build the frame of his house.\r\n\r\nHis biggest challenge has been the price increase of construction materials, but he promises to pay the loan without any problems in order to request other loans to finish his house and leave the old house that was built out of precarious material.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Nina Delgado, Kiva

The couple is blessed with five children, some of whom are still in school. They live in the village of Sitio Nasug-ong, Brgy Caradio-an, Himamaylan City, Negros Occidental.\r\n\r\nTo help her husband meet their family's needs, she joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1999 to earn additional income. She began by buying and selling fruit in front of their house. Then she began selling clothing, where she earned enough money to help tremendously with her family's needs. As she secured additional loans, she looked for other ways to earn money. Now she makes a living selling fish to people in her local community. From this businesses, she earns a minimum of PHP 11,800 per month.  This has allowed her to educate her children and meet many household expenses. \r\n\r\nFlorenda's previous loan of Php19,500 was used for her fish-selling business. She paid it on time and without any delay. Now she has applied for a new loan of PHP 19,500 which we will use to sell fruits and selling of fruits and clothing.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\nIn a world full of challenges,  Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in  the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

He is a 31-year-old trader. He lives with his wife in a rented apartment in a community in the western region of Ghana. He trades in garment tie dye material. Tie dye is designed from the combination of plain white cloth soaked in mixed dye to get the actual design. Tie dye is very useful and beautiful, so many people purchase it. The fabric can be sewn into African wear and it can also be used to sew a traditional style of clothing. Benjamin treks to Takoradi to buy his stock of goods. For lack of adequate working capital, he buys only a small amount of lace material and sells through hawking. He believes the loan will enable him to grow his business to the expected level. With the loan, he wants to purchase lace materials and textiles in bulk.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Judith lives in her parents' house in the city of Tarma.\r\n\r\nShe began her economic activity by opening a small grocery store at home. In time, she noted that it wasn't profitable for lack of capital, and for this reason, she approached her parents who helped her to open a restaurant. Judith has spent the last 3 months at her new trade. She sells a variety of dishes but only during breakfast, since having supplies for mornings, afternoons and nights would require a larger investment. In this manner, Judith has recuperated her initial investment and earns 40 to 50 sols daily.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, Judith was working in a state office as a receptionist, added income that helped positively in the development of herself and her minor daughter. But she had to leave that job because her business absorbed much of her time.

She is living alone with her two (02) children and four (04) other children whom she cares for. Abandoned by her husband who has been living clandestinely in Europe for more than 5 years, Madam Adjoa BLEVI courageously manages to support all her family expenditures. Having dropped out of primary school very early, she started bread selling along roads and streets. Very ingenious, she has early understood that to better succeed in life, she must be her own mistress. That is why she underwent the training in bread making. Also enterprising and very courageous, she didn\u2019t hesitate, from her first credit to build a hard packed oven for bread making and selling. Thanks to the quality of her breads, she is more and more solicited but she is very limited by her means and cannot satisfy her clients who are getting more and more numerous. Madam Adjoa A. really induces trust through the quality of her products and especially the good management of her two credits of $ 450 and $ 650 respectively. She promptly paid reimbursed.\r\n\r\nThe new credit of $ 850 in request will serve to buy the wheat flour and sugar in order to assure availability in stock as in the period of Christmas and New Year those stuffs become scarce and expensive. Surely, this credit will have a positive impact on Madam Adjoa A., because it will help her to increase her production and income to improve her socio-economic living conditions.\r\n\r\n<p> \r\n\r\nMadame A.

N\u2019ayant pas eu la chance de terminer au moins le cours primaire, elle s\u2019\u00e9tait lanc\u00e9 dans la vente de pain au bord des rues. Tr\u00e8s ing\u00e9nieuse, elle a compris tr\u00e8s t\u00f4t que pour mieux r\u00e9ussir sa vie, il faut \u00eatre ma\u00eetresse de soi-m\u00eame. C\u2019est ainsi qu\u2019elle s\u2019est lanc\u00e9e dans l\u2019apprentissage de la fabrication du pain \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9chelle manuel. Aussi entreprenante et tr\u00e8s courageuse qu\u2019elle soit, elle n\u2019a pas tard\u00e9, par son premier cr\u00e9dit \u00e0 construire un four en terre battue pour la fabrication et la vente du pain. Aujourd\u2019hui, de par la qualit\u00e9 de ses pains, elle est de plus en plus sollicit\u00e9e mais ses moyens se trouvent tr\u00e8s limit\u00e9s pour satisfaire sa client\u00e8le qui, sans cesse, ne fait qu\u2019augmenter. Madame A.
