She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 200 talas or US $83 per week) to financially support immediate members of her family.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Sosefina joined SPBD.    This is her 3rd loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Sosefina's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Sosefina P. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.4 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.3 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.3 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              1.4 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

She earns a minimum of 1,500 Philippine pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 48,000 loan. She will be using the loan to buy raw supplies like flour, sugar, and butter, which she needs to continue production and expand her product inventory.

Because of this fascination, when she was 19 years old she decided to attend beauty school and try her hand out in this field. \n\nWhen she finally began to work as a stylist she started in a front room in her house with a chair, a small mirror, and a handful of tools, while advertising her service at a low cost to help her gain clients. As she began building her clientele with the full support of her family, she was able to expand the number of chairs, mirrors, and tools, as well as specializing and perfecting her craft. Today she has come a long way from that tiny first room to having her own locale next to her house, on one of the busiest avenues in the center of her city, Villa Nicolas Romero. \n\nShe currently makes around $MX 4000 pesos a month and continues working hard, opening daily from 10am to 5pm while attending to all her other responsibilities as a wife and mother. Because Silvia wants to continue growing her business, over a year ago she started a group with several of her neighbors, who also are striving to grow their businesses, to ask for a loan.

Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain under served by financial institutions.

Koumba Boit\u00e9 is the mother of four children (two girls and two boys), is 43 years old and lives with her husband, her co-wife, and their children in a polygamous family in Darsalam I neighborhood of Koutiala prefecture (near Sikasso). Selling food seasonings has been Koumba\u2019s specialty for the last 15 years. She started this business very early in her life like most of the women of her generation, who didn\u2019t have the opportunity to study. She has been making sales in the Darsalam I neighborhood where there isn\u2019t a market and thus competitors are fewer. Sales are made from home, where products are spread out on a big table in the middle of the family compound. Her customers are mostly women who make purchases every day. She has had a relationship with the Soro Yiriwaso microfinance institution for the last four years and has borrowed six loans (four group loans and two individual loans) that she has successfully repaid. The current loan will be used to purchase seasonings and vegetables in bulk (baskets of tomatoes, chilies, peppers, a case of spaghetti, two bags of salt, etc.). She anticipates making an average profit of 60,000 Francs CFA per month that she will use toward her family\u2019s needs, to pay interest to Soro Yiriwaso, and to increase her capital.

Most of their children now have their own families, so their family started to get big. Rosenda wants to help all her children in raising their children, especially financially; that is why Rosenda and her husband are striving hard to provide for their big family. The main source of their income is through their fishing business that is personally managed by her husband because he is a fisherman, but aside from that they also run a fish and gasoline business. All of this business contributes to their daily income, but the fishing business is the one that contributes the most, so they focus on it.<p>\r\n\r\nSince she became a member of Kiva field partner Ahon sa Hirap Inc. (ASHI), every loan that Rosenda receives is used in improving this business; that is why her business will continue to run and grow. Her fourth loan will be used again in buying necessary things needed by her business like fishnets, accessories for the fishnets, and much more. And some part of the loan will be used in buying what is needed for their secondary business, which is the buy and sell. She is hoping that after buying all of these things their business will improve more.<p>\r\n\r\nRosenda's dream is that someday they will own a boat and fish cage. Now they will work hard to make this dream possible. And after this dream becomes a reality of course the result will be that their income will increase and they will help their children in providing for their children; and they will be able to release their family from the shadow of

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling daily use products such as shampoo, soap and toothpaste in the local community. Teofila has been engaged in her business for over 3 years and earns approximately 3,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Teofila joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Teofila has successfully repaid a previous loan of 3,000 PHP from GDMPC. This previous loan was used to purchase additional inventory and working capital. Teofila is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the third loan taken out by Teofila from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement her family's income. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.

She lives in her husband's cousin's house with her husband and their two little children who are students at the public school. She buys and sells styrofoam cutters. She's  had this business for five years where she and her husband take these items to schools. They also travel to promote the cutters. Beatriz took out the loan to buy material to make them since she and her husband took some small classes to learn how. Now they will make and sell them as usual by traveling and taking them to schools to promote them. With the money from the loan, she will buy material to make styrofoam. Beatriz and her family are happy for the opportunity given to them since the preferential rate lowers the fee that they were going to pay and the rest will serve to buy a little more

She is 53 years old. Rema is married and has 3 children: two are already married, while the youngest is still studying. To make a living, Rema owns and operates a business venture in the food sector making and selling food. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling snacks and other delicacies in the local community. Rema has been engaged in her business for over 23 years and earns approximately 3,500 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Rema joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Rema is requesting a new loan of 3,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase raw ingredients needed to make products for sale. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Rema from PMPC.

She considers the most difficult thing to be transporting her products to the market in the city of Pichanaki, which is a little far away from her area. In the future she hopes to buy more land and thus increase her production. This is Eudalia's  third loan with MFP and she is saving to be able to make her payments, since she doesn't want to cause any problems for the other members of her community bank, where she is very happy. Euladia is planning on investing the five hundred soles she has asked for in buying fertilizer ad insecticide to care for her land. In this way, she hopes to improve her earnings.

There he has been able to cultivate rice and raise cattle in order to support his family. He has two sons who help him on the farm. One is 17 years old, and the other is 16. He also has a young 7-year-old daughter who is going  to school. He and his wife hope to make the necessary investments in rice that will ensure that the crop goes well, such as fertilizer and pesticides. With this crop cycle's extra profits, they hope to save enough money to make some improvements to their home. He is pictured with Esther from the Mifex staff. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Max is the latest addition to one of the new Communal Banks in the Mifex Rural Finance Program.  All of the members of the 10 de enero Communal Bank are part of an Association of Rice Farmers in Salitre named 10 de enero. They will use the microloans to prepare the lands and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each others' guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the 10 de enero Association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many microfinance programs, but is imperative for the communities Mifex works with to have capital reserves for future investments or unexpected difficulties.<\/p>\r\n\r\n \r\n<h4>Loan Use and Repayment<\/h4>\r\n<p>The loans in this sector will be used to create water basins that will prevent flooding in the case of heavy rains or store water in case of droughts. They will also be used to treat the land prior to farming,  to plant the seeds and purchase fertilizer. The loan repayment schedule is also different from the typical microentrepreneur. Because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures, Mifex asks them only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 5 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the sixth and final month. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><i>Below is more information about Salitre compiled by the staff at Mifex when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. <\/i><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>Economy of Salitre<\/h4>\r\n<p>Salitre is a rural sector in the Province of Guayas known as the capital of Montuvios (montuvio is a cowboy) with approximately 30,000 inhabitants. The main economic activities are herding and agriculture which make up about 80% of the economy. The infrastructure and basic services are poor,  especially the roads and water services.<\/p> \r\n  \r\n<p>Salitre is highly dedicated to farming rice and cattle ranching. Rice is a crop that yields about every four months. In order to farm rice, the environment must be very humid and there must be a high volume of water. The lack of a structured water system makes it difficult for the small farmers to be highly productive. The best months for cultivating rice are early in the year when it is the rainy season in the coast of Ecuador. <\/p> \r\n  \r\n<p>Salitre is a national tourist attraction as many Ecuadorians visit the freshwater Salitre River. There are cottages, small restaurants and water attractions that people come to enjoy.<\/p> \r\n  \r\n<h4>Access to Credit<\/h4>\r\n<p>There are not many financial institutions that provide services to the productive sector of the local economy. The primary access to credit comes from loan sharks who charge extremely high interest rates averaging around 20% a month. The locals are also exploited by the intermediaries that buy their products in order to sell them in the city and to export abroad. These intermediaries buy crops in advance at very low prices, finance soil at extremely high prices and often provide emergency loans for even higher interest rates than the loan sharks.<\/p> \r\n  \r\n  \r\n<h4>Risks<\/h4> \r\n<p>Salitre is a dangerous sector considering it is in a rural area. There is a high incidence of robbery of cattle that results in many of the ranch owners owning weapons to protect their property. Because the police are not present in these areas, farmers and ranchers must apply their own laws and provide their own security. In some instances they have formed their own cooperatives and associations to have a community crime prevention effort.<\/p> \r\n  \r\n<p>Salitre is in the lowlands of Ecuador and is vulnerable to flooding in the rainy season. In the event of a heavy rainy season, often at its worse when El Ni\u00f1o occurs, the farmers of rice lose many of their crops. All this is due to a lack of infrastructure in the area.<\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":35697,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Rice farming","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Salitre","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-1.833333 -79.8","type":"point"}},"partner_id":7,"posted_date":"2007-05-14T04:20:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1200,"lender_count":33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maximiliano","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-06-01T22:38:36Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1200,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":1200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":200}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2008-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":200}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-07-12T22:24:16Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-20T02:13:08Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":31434},{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-08-08T22:29:24Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-20T02:13:08Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":40408},{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-09-11T19:39:52Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-20T02:13:08Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53262},{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-11-30T00:36:15Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-20T02:13:08Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":88536},{"amount":816,"local_amount":816,"processed_date":"2007-12-18T17:45:53Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-20T02:13:08Z","rounded_local_amount":816,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":99032}],"funded_date":"2007-05-18T22:38:36Z","paid_date":"2007-12-18T17:45:53Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":14150,"name":"Rugie","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rugie M. was born in Northern Sierra Leone.

He is married and is a father of three children. His wife does not work anywhere. She stays at home and does housework and feeds the cattle. Tulkun raises and sells cattle. With the arrival of spring for Tulkun it's the season of buying cattle because the price is low during this time. It's not expensive to feed the cattle. It eats mountain grass and Tulkun saves on the fodder. With the arrival of autumn Tulkun sells part of the fed cattle, but he does not buy any.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <p>\r\n\t\r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous, and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment, forcing hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <p>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<p>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Her group is located in the rural areas surrounding Hato Mayor in the eastern lowlands of the Dominican Republic where the economy is centered around agriculture and where running water (none of which is potable) and electricity are unreliable. She makes her home here in a simple structure of wooden walls and a tin roof with her husband and her son.\r\n\r\nJosefina is excited to be taking her fourth loan with Esperanza after having successfully repaid her previous loans without arrears. She plans to use this loan to invest in her business selling clothing and shoes by purchasing blue jeans, blouses and shoes. Her business model is to take orders for clothing and then to go to Santo Domingo and purchase the clothes in the main markets and come back to her community to sell the items at a profit. While 80% of her product is ordered in advance she will sell the rest by walking around the community and searching for clients.\r\n\r\nJosefina will use the profits to invest in her home by completing the project her husband has started to replace the wooden walls with cement block. She also intends to continue investing in her family by purchasing medicine, school supplies and clothes for her son. In the long term her goal is to purchase a small plot of land so that she can construct her own home, as her current home is owned by her parents. She also plans to start university classes in business management soon.

She is starting a business venture, selling traditional handicrafts to tourists and local community members.  Saolo needs a loan of WST $1000 to purchase raw materials to make additional handicrafts.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 250 talas or US $104 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Saolo joined SPBD.  This is her 1st loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Saolo's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Saolo V. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.6 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.7 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.5 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2.3 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

diez a\u00f1os  a la venta de pan y leche en una esquina de uno de los barrios ubicados cerca al centro de la ciudad de Chiclayo. Ella realiza esta actividad diariamente y debido al tiempo que lleva trabajando en la zona ya cuenta con un grupo de clientes fidelizados. El pan lo adquiere en la zona donde vive y la leche la extrae de una vaca que cr\u00eda en su casa. Este negocio le sirve para poyar a su esposo, que es agricultor, con los gastos familiares.\n\nYrene desea ampliar su negocio incursionando en la venta de productos derivados de la leche como queso y mantequilla y tambi\u00e9n en diversos embutidos como jam\u00f3n y salchicha. Para realizar esta acci\u00f3n ha cre\u00eddo conveniente solicitar por primera vez a Edpyme Alternativa un pr\u00e9stamo de 500 nuevos soles que contribuyan al logro de su objetivo.\n\nElla es una mujer bastante alegre y amable. Sus vecinos y clientes le tienen mucha estima y le consideran una mujer entregada a su familia y a su trabajo.

This community is located twenty minutes away from the city of Chiclayo.  \r\n<p>\r\nFor the past ten years, Yrene has been selling bread and milk at a street corner in one of the neighborhoods near the central part of the city of Chiclayo.  She engages in her business every day and has built up a group of loyal customers throughout the time she has been working.  The bread is acquired in the area where she lives and the milk comes from a cow that she raises at home.  This business enables her to help her husband, who is a farmer, with the family expenses.\r\n<p>\r\nYrene wants to expand her business by venturing into the sale of other dairy products such as cheese and butter.  In addition, she wants to sell different cured meats such as ham and sausage.  To accomplish these objectives, she has decided to apply for her first loan from Edpyme Alternativa in the amount of 500 PEN.\r\n<p>\r\nYrene is a cheerful and friendly woman.  Her neighbors and customers have great respect for her and consider her to be a woman who is dedicated to her family and her work.  Her greatest wish is to provide her children with the opportunity to study for a college degree.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":602242,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Market","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Purchase dairy products & cured meats","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Calaz\u00e1n - Monsef\u00fa","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":143,"posted_date":"2010-09-20T03:00:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":200,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Yrene","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-08-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":77.02},{"due_date":"2010-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":79.05},{"due_date":"2010-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":82.05},{"due_date":"2010-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":84.7},{"due_date":"2011-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":87.24},{"due_date":"2011-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":89.94}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.81},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.62},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.82},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.88},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.89},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.98}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":30.81,"local_amount":77.02,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T09:56:40Z","rounded_local_amount":85.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172099654},{"amount":31.62,"local_amount":79.05,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-16T10:43:28Z","rounded_local_amount":88.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177555029},{"amount":32.82,"local_amount":82.05,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T13:46:48Z","rounded_local_amount":91.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182530423},{"amount":33.88,"local_amount":84.7,"processed_date":"2010-12-17T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T12:53:20Z","rounded_local_amount":94.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188666546},{"amount":34.89,"local_amount":87.24,"processed_date":"2011-01-17T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T02:53:51Z","rounded_local_amount":97.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191409873},{"amount":35.98,"local_amount":89.94,"processed_date":"2011-02-17T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T08:31:35Z","rounded_local_amount":100.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":196108306}],"funded_date":"2010-09-20T03:19:13Z","paid_date":"2011-03-24T08:31:35Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ronan Reodica","image":498323}},{"id":236242,"name":"Anonymous","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"","en":""}},"status":"refunded","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":726677,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy manure and other cocoa bean farming supplies.","delinquent":true,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":159,"posted_date":"2010-10-07T23:00:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Anonymous","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-09-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":2,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-29T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2010-10-08T00:02:44Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":240347,"name":"Moses","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Moses has been practicing mixed farming for 10 years in Kitale town, western Kenya.

One member is Rosa Mar\u00eda, president of the communal bank, who is 42 years old, married, and has eight children.  She sells young animals like guinea pigs and chickens, and she also sells grains.\r\n\r\nRosa Mar\u00eda is a native of Cayara.  Her children came to Ayacucho to study, so each time she has come to see them she has taken advantage of the opportunity to bring young animals with her to sell in Ayacucho in order to cover her expenses. Her business is doing well and now she also travels to the market in Cayara, Pampas on Fridays.  She sells her animals at the 12th of April market and returns on Sundays.  The loan she is requesting will be used to purchase more animals and grains.\r\n\r\nRosa Mar\u00eda enjoys her communal bank's meetings at Finca because she appreciates the trainings they receive, and also because she is able to save and borrow money.  Rosa Mar\u00eda's dream is for her children to become professionals and to have enough capital to open her own business."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4400,"image":{"id":691907,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy young animals and grains to sell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":70,"posted_date":"2011-01-14T13:40:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":4400,"lender_count":150,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosa Mar\u00eda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Antonia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Silvia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mardely","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Salustiana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Adela Natividad","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Benedicta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Antonia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juan Marcial","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Norma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lidia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-01-11T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":12250,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":4400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":2041.68},{"due_date":"2011-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":2041.68},{"due_date":"2011-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":2041.68},{"due_date":"2011-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":2041.68},{"due_date":"2011-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":2041.68},{"due_date":"2011-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":2041.6}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":733.34},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":733.34},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":733.33},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":733.34},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":733.34},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":733.31}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":733.34,"local_amount":2041.68,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:38:35Z","rounded_local_amount":2048.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195839416},{"amount":733.34,"local_amount":2041.68,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T10:59:12Z","rounded_local_amount":2048.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201281926},{"amount":733.33,"local_amount":2041.68,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T10:56:15Z","rounded_local_amount":2048.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206149895},{"amount":733.34,"local_amount":2041.68,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:10:55Z","rounded_local_amount":2048.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211222972},{"amount":1466.65,"local_amount":4083.28,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:02:29Z","rounded_local_amount":4097.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216501899}],"funded_date":"2011-01-16T19:36:59Z","paid_date":"2011-07-15T11:02:29Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Katie Kavanagh","image":847206}},{"id":269028,"name":"Dominique Xavier","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Dominique Xavier is 28 years old, married and has as yet no children.

Today, they are requesting a new loan for Le 1,200,000 each to add to their businesses.\r\n\r\nAbdul (front right) is the leader of this group. Abdul was born in Roketeh, six miles from the city of Makeni, in northern Sierra Leone. He is thirty-five years of age, married with two children \u2013 one is in nursery school and the other is only an infant. Abdul also cares for two of his deceased elder brother\u2019s children who are attending school. Abdul\u2019s wife is a businesswoman. Abdul sells ready-to-wear clothes.\r\n\r\nWith this loan of Le 1,200,000, Abdul will buy about forty pairs of jeans and four dozen shirts. He travels to neighboring Guinea to buy the clothes, paying a round\/trip fare of Le 60,000. In Guinea, a pair of trousers costs Le 25,000.  He sells each pair in Sierra Leone for Le 30,000.  \r\n\r\nThe only challenge Abdul is facing is that of bad debts. Sometimes relatives will borrow money from him and will never pay back. Apart from this, business is going fine and he enjoys doing it. Outside of his business, Abdul would like to do great things for himself. He would like to buy a plot of land for his family and eventually build a house.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2800,"image":{"id":239795,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":["Conflict Zones"],"use":"buying more jeans and shirts to sell in his store","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SL","country":"Sierra Leone","town":"Makeni","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"8.883333 -12.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":57,"posted_date":"2009-01-01T08:00:16Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2800,"lender_count":94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Abdul","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ramatu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Isatu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kadiatu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marie","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatamata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatmata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-12-11T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"SLL","disbursal_amount":8400000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":2800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":933333.33},{"due_date":"2009-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":933333.33},{"due_date":"2009-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":933333.33},{"due_date":"2009-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":933333.33},{"due_date":"2009-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":933333.33},{"due_date":"2009-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":933333.33},{"due_date":"2009-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":933333.33},{"due_date":"2009-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":933333.33},{"due_date":"2009-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":933333.36}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":311.11},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":311.11},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":311.11},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":311.11},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":311.12},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":311.11},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":311.11},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":311.11},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":311.11}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":311.11,"local_amount":933333.33,"processed_date":"2009-01-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:04:39Z","rounded_local_amount":934266.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14885073},{"amount":311.11,"local_amount":933333.33,"processed_date":"2009-02-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T20:55:28Z","rounded_local_amount":934266.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20434522},{"amount":311.11,"local_amount":933333.33,"processed_date":"2009-03-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:45:47Z","rounded_local_amount":934266.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27128915},{"amount":311.11,"local_amount":933333.33,"processed_date":"2009-04-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:12:53Z","rounded_local_amount":934266.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36025704},{"amount":311.11,"local_amount":933333.33,"processed_date":"2009-05-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:03:42Z","rounded_local_amount":934266.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44611607},{"amount":311.11,"local_amount":933333.33,"processed_date":"2009-06-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T23:52:03Z","rounded_local_amount":934266.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53008508},{"amount":311.12,"local_amount":933333.33,"processed_date":"2009-07-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:22:54Z","rounded_local_amount":934266.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63230849},{"amount":311.11,"local_amount":933333.33,"processed_date":"2009-08-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:37:49Z","rounded_local_amount":934266.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73662618},{"amount":311.11,"local_amount":933333.36,"processed_date":"2009-09-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T02:18:26Z","rounded_local_amount":934266.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87102854}],"funded_date":"2009-01-04T19:28:27Z","paid_date":"2009-10-16T02:18:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":83822,"name":"Duong Thi","description":{"languages":["vi","en"],"texts":{"vi":"Ch\u1ecb D\u01b0\u01a1ng Th\u1ecb \u0110\u00e0o n\u0103m nay  48 tu\u1ed5i, ch\u1ecb l\u00e0 th\u00e0nh vi\u00ean c\u1ee7a Qu\u1ef9 t\u00ecnh th\u01b0\u01a1ng t\u1eeb n\u0103m 1993.

It is also known for its famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi, and many others. The country, filled with epic mountain passes, is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, and boasts a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 percent of the country is mountainous and only 7 percent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

obstacles and continue to improve her situation. She is an extremely hard-working and energetic woman. She is 32 years old, married, and the loving mother of three children.\r\n\r\nFor more than 6 years, Barno has operated a store where she sells women\u2019s clothing. As a rule she travels to the neighboring town to get new garments at very cheap prices. Her store is well known, and people love to visit because it's clean, tidy, and run by someone who is very kind and thoughtful.\r\n\r\nBarno hopes that her store will keep growing so that she can maintain a comfortable life for her family, especially for her children. To make that possible, she has applied for a new loan that she will use to buy more clothing to sell. She promises to repay the loan with accuracy as she has done with previous loans.\r\n\r\nBe an important part of the growth of Barno\u2019s business.\r\n \r\n\r\n<b>More about Tajikistan and IMON International<\/b>\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

They have four adult children aged between 20 and 30 with one currently going to school and they also help out in the business as part of their daily chores.\r\n\r\nPaz joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2001 in the hope that she would be able to help her husband improve their family's quality of life. With the help of her loans from NWTF-PD, she has been able to increase their family income by engaging in candy manufacturing. Now she earns an average monthly income of Php 32,000 from her business activities.\r\n\r\nPaz is a member of good standing. Her previous loan of Php 29,500 was used to fund the operations of her candy manufacturing and had a positive impact on both the business and the family\u2019s living conditions. Borrowing the amount of PHP 29,500 for her 17th loan, she intends to use the money on her candy manufacturing. Paz is working hard to achieve her dreams and aspirations for her family, which is to provide them with a brighter future and a more comfortable life. Paz is with her husband in the picture.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means 'honorable'). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon -a title of esteem that is bestowed on a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest

She also has an electronic cellular phone loading station where she sells load to different networks.\r\n\r\nAsuncion has been a regular member of Center for Community Transformation* (CCT) for more than a year.  She regularly attends weekly fellowship meetings and pays her weekly dues consistently. Because of her good repayment performance with her previous loans, she has borrowed several times from CCT\u2019s Cooperative.  She is consistent in paying her dues because she used the money she borrowed to expand and improve her businesses.     \r\n\r\nTo ensure the success of her business, Asuncion would like to apply for a PHP 26,000 loan. This amount will be used as a source of added capital for her expanding business to replenish the stock of her current product inventory. She also will invest some of the loan in buying cellular phone load for different networks.\r\n\r\nShe dreams that her business will continue to grow and be successful.\r\n\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance loans.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":545599,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To replenish current inventory","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Caloocan City","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2010-05-27T11:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":575,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Asuncion ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-04-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":26000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1733.33},{"due_date":"2010-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1733.33},{"due_date":"2010-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1733.33},{"due_date":"2010-05-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1733.33},{"due_date":"2010-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1733.33},{"due_date":"2010-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1733.33},{"due_date":"2010-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1733.33},{"due_date":"2010-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1733.33},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1733.33},{"due_date":"2010-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":1733.33},{"due_date":"2010-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1733.33},{"due_date":"2010-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1733.33},{"due_date":"2010-07-29T07:00:00Z","amount":1733.33},{"due_date":"2010-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1733.33},{"due_date":"2010-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1733.38}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.33},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.34},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.33},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.33},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.34},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.33},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.33},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.34},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.33},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.33},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.34},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.33},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.33},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.34},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":153.33,"local_amount":6933.32,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:00:06Z","rounded_local_amount":7198.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144684753},{"amount":153.34,"local_amount":6933.32,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-16T07:35:54Z","rounded_local_amount":7198.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":152028653},{"amount":191.66,"local_amount":8666.65,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T10:43:32Z","rounded_local_amount":8997.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159608072},{"amount":76.67,"local_amount":3466.71,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T09:56:44Z","rounded_local_amount":3599.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166821583}],"funded_date":"2010-05-28T11:38:49Z","paid_date":"2010-09-15T09:56:44Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Nancy Nethery","image":268367}},{"id":207580,"name":"Razia's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Razia is the wife of M.

They all live together on a trail along the pleasant Peruvian hill country. \r\n\r\nShe has been working in agriculture since she was young. First she helped her parents, now she works the land with her husband. They plant potatoes, peas and corn on their own farm. She enjoys waking up early to tend to her fields because she knows her hard work is necessary to obtain a productive crop to sell to the whole sellers in town. She sells her production as soon as she harvests it because her buyers know the quality of her products. \r\n\r\nShe always works thinking of improving her children's lives. She wants them to go to school and become professionals. In addition, she says the hardest part of her job is transporting her production to sell it since the bags are very heavy. \r\n\r\nBeing the entrepreneur that she is, she plans to plant more to generate more income. This is her seventh credit with MFP. She is very thankful for all people who have made the loan that will help her continue to work possible. She is also very pleased with the work of her community group. They are well organized and responsible for the payment of their loans.  \r\n\r\nRosa plans to invest their loan in the purchase of three bags of fertilizer and pea seeds. She wants to improve her field's productivity and therefore continue to grow her business. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Betyna Almeida-Covarrubias, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":900,"image":{"id":586214,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Purchase of three bags of fertilizer and pea seeds","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-08-19T19:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":900,"lender_count":29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-07-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":2500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":900}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":900,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T04:40:58Z","rounded_local_amount":2519.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191463117}],"funded_date":"2010-08-19T21:32:02Z","paid_date":"2011-02-16T04:40:58Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Betyna Almeida-Covarrubias","image":null}},{"id":228065,"name":"Reuben","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Reuben is a 27-year-old married man who belongs to Mwiki Dreamers group in Faulu Kenya.\r\n\r\nReuben runs a taxi business and hopes to invest in his business through his savings so as to improve his standard of living.

","en":"Carlos Alfredo G. is 20 years old, and resides in the Palmira neighborhood of the town of San Esteban, together with his live-in partner and their two children of 2 and 7.  He is a hard-working young man, and is well-regarded by his neighbors.  He began working at the age of 12 because his parents could not afford to send him to school.  Presently, Carlos sells all kinds of accessories for cell phones, as well as movies and sunglasses.  He sells them every day on foot, traveling large distances.  He needs the loan to buy chargers, covers, and movies and thus supply his business with new and novel products.  One of the difficulties he faces is that his job requires a lot of physical effort and that in this season it rains frequently, and he has to be very careful with his merchandise, because if it gets wet it is ruined.  His dream is to set up his business in one place and become an authorized distributor for a cell phone company, so he can earn more and thus be able to build his own house.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Zach Powell, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":602271,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Phone Accessories","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Comprar accesorios para telefonos celulares","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"San Esteban","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15 -86.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":168,"posted_date":"2010-09-18T21:30:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Carlos Alfredo ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-08-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":7000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2010-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2010-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2011-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2011-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2011-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2011-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.57},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.57},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.57},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.58},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.57},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.57},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.57}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":107.14,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T13:44:49Z","rounded_local_amount":2024.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177396155},{"amount":53.57,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-08T10:52:09Z","rounded_local_amount":1012.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182534712},{"amount":53.57,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-19T09:45:52Z","rounded_local_amount":1012.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":189137386},{"amount":160.72,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T03:07:04Z","rounded_local_amount":3036.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191414798}],"funded_date":"2010-09-19T00:39:02Z","paid_date":"2011-02-16T03:07:04Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Zachary Powell","image":null}},{"id":236258,"name":"Arely Sugey","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La Joven Arely Sugey Chavarr\u00eda P., se dedica a vender sopa y nacatamales, es madre soltera de un ni\u00f1o de 2 a\u00f1itos, trabaja por cuenta propia.\n\nLleva ya 36 cr\u00e9ditos con ceprodel los cuales los utiliza para compra de insumos para la preparaci\u00f3n de sus ventas, ha demostrado ser una persona muy responsable en sus pagos.\n","en":"Arely Sugey Chavarr\u00eda P. sells soup and nacatamales (Nicaraguan tamales popular as weekend fare).

What she most likes about her work is feeding her birds since she raises them with a lot of care.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n<P>\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

She takes delivery from the farmers at Tachiman in the Brong Ahafo region of Ghana and this has enabled her to cut out the middleman and increase her profits.

Fante kenkey is prepared from milled grains taken with fish and any gravy or soup. It is enjoyed by many Ghanaians.

She is 58 years old. Emerita is widowed and has seven adult-aged children. To make a living, Emerita owns and operates a business venture in the retail sector running a sari-sari (variety) shop. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from selling both food and daily use products in the local community. Emerita has been engaged in her business for over 15 years and earns approximately 5000 PHP per month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Emerita joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. Emerita has successfully repaid a previous loan of 8000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional products to sell. Emerita is requesting a new loan of 11000 PHP which will also be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the 3rd loan taken out by Emerita from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Ni Ketut Sutiami goes to the market from 4:00 AM to buy her retail items needs in the Morning Market in Negara city. Ni Ketut Sutiami opens her retail stall from 7:00 AM to 6:00 PM. Each day profit could reach up to Rp50,000 (US$5.50). This profit is used to help her husband I Made Rina who works as a tenant farmer, to pay living expenses and education expenses for their 2 children. First child is in 9th Grade, and the second in 5th grade. Capital loaned from Dinari would be used to complete facilities in retail stall. Ni Ketut Sutiami hopes that with Dinari's capital her business would expand, moves forward, and their lifes needs fulfilled.\r\n\r\n<p><b>Translated from Bahasa Indonesia by Gwan Liong Ang, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\nKarena biaya hidup yang cukup berat karena harus menanggung dua anak yang masih sekolah, Ni Ketut Sutiami memberanikan diri untuk membuka usaha warung dirumahnya.

She has been in the business for twelve years. She began her business only selling tamales and ice cream, but the need to earn more money made her look for other products to sell. It was in this way that she began to sell corn, which she buys in the Terminal market in the capital city. She brings it to her village of Chixolis in Santiago Sacatepequez, where she sells her products among her neighbors and friends. As she got more clients, they asked Elfida for other things. Because of this, she began to sell eggs, soda water, and clothes. She has 4 children, and her husband helps her in her business. She wants to invest the loan to buy more merchandise because it is cheaper to buy at wholesale. She wants to have a well-stocked business so that she can also increase her earnings. Her goals are to be able to continue improving her house. She has already fought with a lot of strength to have her own house, since she and her husband are originally from the Southern coast of the country. Because of all of this, she continues fighting to improve and have a dignified home for her children.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Avni Shah, Kiva

As quickly as they make the soap, it is bought by customers in the interior of the country.  This family is not in a position to meet their customers' demand despite financial help from all sides.  They are now asking for a loan to purchase the raw materials to make more soap.  Once the loan is extended, this honest and hard-working family will be able to improve their living conditions.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Laure Kwon, Kiva

Freetown. She sells local produce like ground-nuts and beans. She has been in this business for ten years now but her business seems to be growing at a very slow pace.

He is married and has three children. Sharif lives with his parents and is the main breadwinner for this large family. \r\n\r\nSharif runs a caf\u00e9 where he cooks different national dishes. A very good and experienced cook, Sharif managed to make his business successful. Sharif uses the income from his business to improve his family's living conditions. He also dreams about educating his children in the institutes and universities. \r\n\r\nSharif is planning to make major repairs to his caf\u00e9 so he can attract new clients and keep the old ones. For this purpose, he requests $2000 USD. Sharif thanks all lenders for their support and promises to be precise in his loan payments.   \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He is living with one parent and one sibling. All three household members work to support the family\u2019s expenses. He has owned his own bakery since 2008. He has to pay the \u201cnew\u201d rent for his business, which is significantly more than that of long-time business owners, who have benefited from extremely low rent costs. \r\n\r\nThis borrower is requesting a loan of $1,200 from Kiva partner Ameen s.a.l. to invest in two machines for his work. One will help in mixing the flour and water and the other will help roll out the dough and make it flat. In Lebanon, there are many small shops to buy fresh bread and homemade Lebanese \u201cpizzas\u201d called \u201cmanouche.\u201d These foods are especially popular for breakfast or as a snack. \r\n\r\nThis will be his second loan from Ameen. He demonstrated consistent and on-time payments during his last loan cycle.\r\n\r\nNote: Based on the political and social challenges of Lebanon, personally identifiable attributes of this entrepreneur have been altered to protect him (i.e. blacking out portions of the entrepreneur in his picture, not indicating his name and location, etc.).
