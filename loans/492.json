Guayaquil.  She is located in a periurban (immediately adjoining an urban area; between the suburbs and the countryside)  area and has a cement house with few basic services.  She began to learn to style hair at the age of 15 and at the age of 18 began to work as a stylist where she learned how to run a beauty salon.  This was her motivation to set up her own salon at age 24 by renting a small locale for it.  Miriam currently does 20 hair cuts per day.  On weekends she does hair coloring and straightening.  She begins her work day at 9am and works until 6pm.  One of the complications inherent in the area where she lives is the number of robberies.  Already on one occasion she lost all her equipment and tools to them.  Although her husband helps out with household expenses with his earnings as a conductor, she wants to insure her 15-year-old only daughter's, who is in private school, future.  With the loan she will buy more hair dryers, hair coloring agents, hair straighteners.

Her husband is a builder.  He can not work steadily because of the lack of construction work in Bolivia.  Previous loan money was invested in the construction of her house.  This work was done by her husband.  Her daughter knits blankets.

She used the savings she had to buy chickens to sell to her neighbors and friends.  Little by little she started to get income.  She bought a freezer because the chickens no longer fit in the refrigerator.\r\n\r\nShe continues in the business as it is the first income she has had since her husband died.  She works everyday selling chickens, turkey, and meats.  She wants to use the loan to buy more chickens, meats, and turkeys for her business.

She was born in a low-income family with many children.

When she was 19, she was given into marriage and moved to her husband\u2019s home, where she still lives with the husband and his elderly parents. At the husband\u2019s place, she continued to work around the house. At that time, the family had one milk cow and a plot of land where they cultivated clover and barley. Later, their livestock grew and they got sheep and a horse.\r\n\r\nIn 1980, Nesipkul gave birth to their only son. During all these years, their efforts were aimed on supporting and expanding their household and Nesipkul never dealt with any other business. Five years ago, the D.\u2019s son married and moved out. In 2009, Nesipkul got a loan from another bank to buy a car. The loan was used as intended and was repaid without any delays.\r\n\r\nNow Nesipkul requests a loan to buy five calves and to harvest clover and barley.

She lives in her own home in the village of Picoy with her husband Marcos, 36, and their only daughter, Yulisa, who is 13 years old. Marcos and Yuliza are the inspiration for all her hard work. Through great effort and sacrifice, Carmen has been able to work her lands and make them very fertile. She grows potatoes and peas, which she then carries to the city of Tarma to sell at wholesale. Her harvests have provided enough income to support her family, which is why she wants to put everything she has into growing her business. She also works weeding the crops in neighboring fields in her spare time, for which she earns 15 soles a day. She is confident that she'll be able to earn enough money to acquire fields along the river, which will be easy to irrigate and improve her harvest. What she likes most about her job is taking care of her crops. She's been farming for four years and thinks the hardest part is taking her product to the wholesale market in Tarma, since the sacks are very heavy and tire her out. In the future, she hopes to improve her crops and earn more income. She plans to start growing flowers on her land in anticipation of November, when demand for flowers goes up because of the national holidays. She is a member of the Exaltaci\u00f3n Santa Cruz village bank, and this is her ninth loan with MFP. She is happy to know that she will have financial support in meeting her goals.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is married to a business executive who guides and counsels her in the management of her store, which is unusual in this area. She generates a good income these days and foresees selling even more for the festivals at the end of the year. To establish a stock of fashionable items, she is seeking a loan through WAGES (one of Kiva's field partners) to buy high quality shoes, shirts, and dresses for children, as well as baby bottles currently in fashion. She is the mother of two children and believes that this loan will bring positive change to the development of her business.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Vilas Menon, Kiva

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

Josephine has been engaged in her business for over six years and earns approximately 1,000 PHP a month. \r\n\r\nJosephine joined GDMPC in 2011 to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. She is requesting a loan of 5,000 PHP to invest in expanding her business by purchasing farm products from her neighbors to sell. This will be the first loan taken out by Josephine from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated with her loan to improve and expand her business.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has seven branches covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":125,"image":{"id":783200,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase farm products from her neighbors to sell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Tukuran, Zamboanga Del Sur","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":136,"posted_date":"2011-06-08T14:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":125,"lender_count":4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Josephine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-05-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":5000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2011-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2011-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2011-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2011-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2011-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2011-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":0.02}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.84},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.84},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":38.15,"local_amount":1526,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:13:16Z","rounded_local_amount":1649.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216514126},{"amount":11.85,"local_amount":474,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:53:57Z","rounded_local_amount":512.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221679412},{"amount":75,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T09:19:02Z","rounded_local_amount":3243.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227048088}],"funded_date":"2011-06-08T15:08:54Z","paid_date":"2011-09-15T09:19:02Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":309685,"name":"Damaso","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El Sr. Damaso  tiene 49 a\u00f1os de edad, es casado y tiene 4 hijos, dos en edad escolar y dos ya mayores de edad, vive en la ciudad de Carapegua, compa\u00f1\u00eda Espartillar.\nDon Damaso  trabaj\u00f3  como empleado de un Surtidor por mas de 7 a\u00f1os y con el transcurrir del tiempo fue adquiriendo capital  para  comprar mercader\u00edas y as\u00ed  iniciarse como vendedor ambulante.\nRecorre por ciudades de Alto Paran\u00e1 ofreciendo y colocando  productos de primera calidad, transport\u00e1ndose en su motocicleta, que gracias a este trabajo logr\u00f3 comprarse todo esto con el objetivo de brindarle a su familia la manutenci\u00f3n necesaria y un hogar digno y confortable.\nCon el cr\u00e9dito realizara la compra de mercader\u00edas (hamacas, frazadas, fajas y s\u00e1banas) puesto que tiene muchos pedidos de estos productos.","en":"Damaso is 49 years old, married, and has four children.

Desde muy joven fue fot\u00f3grafo en las playas y como aparecieron nuevas tecnolog\u00edas y todo el mundo ten\u00eda su propia c\u00e1mara, dej\u00f3 este negocio y hace 6 a\u00f1os emprendi\u00f3 una actividad de comercializaci\u00f3n de ranchos, v\u00edveres, enlatados refrescos embutidos, en su vivienda observando que en este sector no contaba una tienda. Al principio sus ventas fueron muy bajas, pero fue persistente y ha logrado paulatinamente crecer y sostenerse. Su mercado est\u00e1 compuesto por una clientela de pensionados de una empresa portuaria, a quienes Hugo le acredita v\u00edveres y le pagan mensualmente, as\u00ed mismo amas de casa que le compran de contado y diariamente. Su trato amable y los precios que ofrece hacen que sus clientes sostengan relaciones de fidelidad.

Ever since he was very young he was a photographer at the beaches.  As new technologies appeared, everyone in the world had their own camera.  \r\n\r\nHe left this business and six years ago he started selling foodstuffs, snacks, canned goods, soft drinks, and sausages at his house.  He observed that his area did not have a store.  At first his sales were very low.  However, he was persistent, and he managed to gradually grow and support himself.\r\n\r\nHis market is comprised of customers who are pensioners from the Port Authority.  Hugo gives them credit for provisions, and they pay him monthly.  At the same time, housewives buy from him daily and pay cash.

She requested her loan to stock her store.  She will buy sugar, oil, chocolates, eggs, soap, milk, rice, soft drinks, corn, beans, and sweets.

A neighbor invited her to establish the store, and they set it up together.  The woman was single, and she did not want to continue with the business.  That is how Camila continued on with the store by herself.  Her business is important because it helps with the food, and it helps pay for the telephone and electricity.  She is proud to have her grocery store and of working in the fields.\r\n\r\nShe grows seasonal corn, which she plants each year.  Her business is well-known because she tends to her customers in a good-natured way.  Her sister and her niece also help her tend to the customers.  Her business faces competition from some stores, but each one already has their customers.  She uses the income from her business to pay the field workers and to pay for electricity and the telephone.\r\n\r\nShe is planning to buy some pigs and calves to raise and later sell.  Her dreams and hopes are that God continues helping her to continue in her work.  She is thrilled with this loan that she is going to receive.

Reyna is thankful for the opportunity the loan provides -- building is expensive and she wouldn't be able to build the wall otherwise.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Violeta Rubiani, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":377915,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":null,"use":"buy construction materials to build a wall","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Managua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.150833 -86.268333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":98,"posted_date":"2009-09-02T18:40:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Reyna De Los Angeles","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-08-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":7000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":777.78},{"due_date":"2009-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":777.78},{"due_date":"2009-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":777.78},{"due_date":"2010-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":777.78},{"due_date":"2010-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":777.78},{"due_date":"2010-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":777.78},{"due_date":"2010-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":777.78},{"due_date":"2010-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":777.78},{"due_date":"2010-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":777.76}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.89},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.89},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.89},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.89},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.89},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.88},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.89},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.89},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.89}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":38.89,"local_amount":777.78,"processed_date":"2009-10-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T10:41:41Z","rounded_local_amount":796.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96875879},{"amount":43.97,"local_amount":879.42,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T10:46:51Z","rounded_local_amount":900.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103713797},{"amount":44.09,"local_amount":881.73,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T10:56:55Z","rounded_local_amount":903.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110601492},{"amount":34.33,"local_amount":686.65,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T09:52:04Z","rounded_local_amount":703.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118002944},{"amount":33.17,"local_amount":663.32,"processed_date":"2010-02-17T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T07:52:30Z","rounded_local_amount":679.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123841097},{"amount":52.23,"local_amount":1044.53,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T07:49:37Z","rounded_local_amount":1069.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128874008},{"amount":25.54,"local_amount":511.03,"processed_date":"2010-04-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T09:29:47Z","rounded_local_amount":523.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136603943},{"amount":38.89,"local_amount":777.78,"processed_date":"2010-05-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T08:30:22Z","rounded_local_amount":796.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144639399},{"amount":38.89,"local_amount":777.76,"processed_date":"2010-06-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:00:02Z","rounded_local_amount":796.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151821182}],"funded_date":"2009-09-17T18:08:55Z","paid_date":"2010-07-15T09:00:02Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Violeta Rubiani","image":null}},{"id":136794,"name":"Bashorat","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"I. Bashorat is 48 years old. She\u2019s married with two children. The difficult circumstances and hardships in her life made her recognize the value of work from a very young age. For about 20 years she is purchasing the young cattle and calves in the local market, fattens and sells them. Bashorat is a very hard-working woman and her diligence is incredible. She works with a strength worthy of immense admiration. She has always looked for a way to be an important protagonist by providing extra income to her home. Bashorat wakes up early every morning to feed her cows and bulls, with the goal of fattening them and selling them at the best price in the local market. Her husband (pictured) actively helps her with operations. Thanks to this activity she is supporting her children with education. Bashorat wants to keep educating them because she hopes that they\u2019ll reach the goals that they have laid out for themselves. With this purpose she is requesting a loan of $ 800 USD to buy calves in order to expand her business. Let\u2019s support this brave woman who has a lot of courage and strength to live.     \n\n\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\n\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Lina is now requesting a new loan of 1450 WST which will be used to purchase additional handicrafts to sell.  This will be the 2nd loan taken out by the borrower from SPBD.  Lina plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business  to improve\/expand her business.<P>\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD:<P>\r\n\r\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.

She is known as a person who sets her whole heart on her pupils' education. Taking into account her striving to make children progressive, she is titled as an Honoured Education Worker.  \r\n\r\nAs it is known, in rural areas, the salaries of teachers are low and do not cover all the expenses of a household. That\u2019s why these people need to find an additional means of subsistence for their families. Kulbara, like many others in such a situation, began her own business in cattle breeding and land cultivating. Starting from buying one cow, she managed to enlarge the number of livestock to 10 sheep, one milk cow, one calf and one horse. Also, Kulbara has a beautiful small-scale garden with apples, pears and raspberries, which gives her some earnings for supporting her children. For her family use, she dries these fruits and makes provisions for the winter. \r\n \r\nNow, Kulbara wants to take a loan of 60,000 Kyrgyzstan soms (KGS) to buy five bull-calves for fattening and reselling. With the revenues from this investment, she plans to build a house for her family. In the future, Kulbara plans to develop her farm by means of livestock breeding.\r\n\r\nBai-Tushum and Partners uses Kiva funding to target the especially vulnerable population.

This time, for her 9th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 15,000 which she intends to use to buy raw materials for her tailoring business so that she could continue to save up for the future of her children's education and expansion of her business. \r\n\r\nLetecia T. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

He knows this business will succeed because he is located at a good business site, the city of Bamenda. He plans to use the profits generated to sponsor his children in school and to cater to the basic needs of his family. \r\n\r\nHe and his wife, Ndum Mispa, have six children. His wife joined GHAPE in 2010 because she found that she could not take care of the family singlehandedly (a situation exacerbated by problems with her in-laws) and the children lacked basic care. These problems are saddening to Fuh I., but he is grateful to be alive and is driven to give his children the love and education they need. He states that \"he feels better each time he provides something small to his children.\" \r\n\r\nHe needs investment capital that can constantly generate income for him to meet his children\u2019s needs, and his inability to obtain such capital is what motivated him to obtain a loan from GHAPE.\r\n\r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon. GHAPE works towards the empowerrment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach.

Working the earth has been part of her daily routine since childhood.  Her parents were farmers and when she got engaged to her husband, she devoted even more time to this work.  About five years ago, in addition to other crops, Delia began to plant flowers, and she is very happy with her work and what the fields she sows produce.  Last October she sold flowers at a good price because of All Souls' Day.  Twelve dozen flowers sold for between 70 and 80 soles, but at other times of the year the price drops to only 20 soles.  Due to this factor, Delia tries to plant at the proper time to harvest in those months when the price is better, but much also depends on rainfall, irrigation and fertilizer.  She also continues to plant vegetables like carrots and spinach to provide an alternate source of income for their home.  Delia has taken out five loans with MFP without a problem, and has promised to repay her sixth loan on time.  With the money she has requested, she will purchase fertilizer for the flowers.  Without fertilizer the earth does not produce, Delia says, because planting flowers exhausts the soil.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Joyce ., Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":254805,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Flowers","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Purchase of fertilizer for flowers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-01-14T17:20:36Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":800,"lender_count":1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Delia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-12-18T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":2500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":800}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":800,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2009-10-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:07:56Z","rounded_local_amount":2566.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96996394}],"funded_date":"2009-01-14T17:26:47Z","paid_date":"2009-11-16T03:07:56Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Joyce .","image":null}},{"id":87610,"name":"George","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"George K. sells frozen fish at Nyankumasi near Cape Coast.

His wife is a hairdresser for a private company. He lives in a ger, a traditional Mongolian nomadic tent, and operates a taxi service in his town. He began his business in 2007 after working and living in Korea for two years. Since then, his working capital has grown and he plans to open a hair salon for his wife. Within a short period of operating his business, he has gained a good professional reputation among the people of his town as a safe, reliable driver. Surenhorloo would eventually like to buy a larger, more comfortable car so that he can transport more people across longer distances, which would increase his profits. He is requesting a 1,500,000-tugrug loan to purchase replacement parts for his taxi so that he can keep getting his customers where they need to go and furniture for his

Within this competitive environment, the group already has regular customers who are familiar with its work and ask for its services and products.  The group is enthusiastic about what it does.\r\n\r\nThis credit will be used as working capital for buying merchandise, raw materials, and work tools.  The group expects to keep working in order to grow and to increase its profits so its members can give their families a better quality of life.  Their bank is already familiar with this group--it is not their first loan, but their third funding cycle.  They have previously demonstrated that they are responsible, united, and hard-working enough to look to the future.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ross Forman, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":545012,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"Working Capital","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-17 -65","type":"point"}},"partner_id":73,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":4025,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gaby","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Pura","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gabriela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Zulma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Isabel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dionicia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Diana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dora","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ascencia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Delsy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gavina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ruth Mery","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-04-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":28000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":4025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":2187.34},{"due_date":"2010-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":2212.84},{"due_date":"2010-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":2238.63},{"due_date":"2010-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":2264.78},{"due_date":"2010-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":2291.21},{"due_date":"2010-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":2317.94},{"due_date":"2010-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":2345},{"due_date":"2010-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":2372.32},{"due_date":"2010-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":2400.01},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2428.01},{"due_date":"2010-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":2456.32},{"due_date":"2010-09-29T07:00:00Z","amount":2485.6}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":314.43},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":318.1},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":321.8},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":325.56},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":329.36},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":333.21},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":337.09},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":341.02},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":345},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":349.03},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":353.1},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":357.3}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ross Forman","image":1172721}},{"id":207272,"name":"Hourt","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Hourt S. is one of many Cambodian people who earn a living by planting crops.

Ruziniso thanks all for their support and promises to pay the loan in time.   <p>\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, including being a key post along the Silk Road, the end of Alexander the Great's rule, and its famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, and Mavlavi Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <p>\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R. further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <p>\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility.

Sarvar is dedicated to his agricultural business. Having little knowledge in the beginning, he had to learn a lot about farming. Now, he has acquired a fair experience in agriculture. Currently, Sarvar is very happy, for his two children are the motivation for his desire to grow his business. He approached IMON International to obtain a loan to buy seeds and fertilizer to sow for a good harvest so that he can take care of his children and his home.\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

ranks first in the life of Remelina U., 35. She reached college and uses all she learned from there and from the entrepreneurial training she receives as a community partner in CCT* to boost her business. She is married to Roy, the driver of a delivery truck. They have two children, who are both in elementary school. Their family came from the province of Bohol and now resides in Baseco, Manila.\r\n\r\nLast year, Remelina saw a good business opportunity buying and selling ready-to-wear clothes. She then pushed through with this venture until today. Mainly, Remelina\u2019s business is rug-making. She uses cheap raw materials to come up with nice rugs for sale. Aside from that, she also sells electronic load for mobile phones which is much in demand nowadays. With all these businesses Remelina earns around Php 10,000 per month.\r\n\r\nKnowing that she\u2019ll be needing more finances to help her grow her business, Remelina applies for a Php 21,000 loan. She will use this money to purchase raw materials necessary for rug-making. Also, part of the loan will go to the improvement of the family comfort room.\r\n\r\nFinancial needs such as medication for her ailing mother bother Remelina. But despite these struggles she knows she has to continue the operation of her business, since this will be one way which God will use to give them financial provision. Remelina is hopeful, knowing that soon she will be able to relocate the site of her store. More than anything, she desires to see her family grow closer to God and have a good life. She yearns to see her children surpass her and graduate from college.\r\n\r\nAs a CCT community partner, she faithfully attends the group's weekly fellowship* meeting where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she received.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance loans.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":719830,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Weaving","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"raw

Tul Group","description":{"languages":["es"],"texts":{"es":"<P>Among the many qualities of the clients of ComUnidad del Tul (term that Friendship Bridge uses to describe a Communal Bank), there is one that is worth emphasizing \u2013 the harmony that exists between the two different ethnic groups: Mayas Kachikeles and ladinas (descendents of Europe), that constitute the group. It is remarkable to see women that belong to different cultures work, organize themselves and get along so well. This characteristic particularly stands out when the Board of Directors, which consists of ladina and Maya Kachikel women, work together in a harmonious and effective manner.\r\n \r\n<P>The great majority of these women were weavers before receiving their first loan through Friendship Bridge. Many of them helped their mothers embroider huipiles (traditional Guatemalan dresses). However, with the loan they will receive from Kiva, our clients have chosen to change their path toward a more prosperous one.\r\n\r\n<P>At this time, the women of del Tul are investing their money in a variety of economic activities. For example, CarmeL. S. has been investing her loan in a toy store, MicaeL. J. in her convenience store, Rosa Ajpuac in her bakery, and Blanca U. in her candle and decorations store. Irma C. will invest in buying 300 roosters and hens, which she buys at 40 quetzales and then resells for 60 quetzales. Finally, another interesting initiative is that of Ana Sologui, who invests her money in her small parceL. (land plot) for harvesting coffee, which is then exported to Mexico and El Salvador.\r\n \r\n<P>The dreams of many of these women are centered on enabling themselves to buy a small plot of land where they can build a house or expand their respective homes, being that a small house is not adequate for their sizeable families. Delmy D. Le\u00f3n said: \u201cI would like to buy a plot because my house is not large enough for my family.\u201d Delmy has eight children. Suseth G. would like to buy two cuerdas (1 cuerda = 25m x 25m) of coffee for her son. Finally, CarmeL. told her group that she would love to buy a car to be able to work in a more efficient and less sacrificed manner and to travel. These women have a lot of hope in life and in God, being that they have been given an opportunity to succeed. It is for this reason, that they should be supported so that they may continue having that hope.\r\n \r\n<P>This picture was taken during a pre-qualifying credit reunion.\r\n\r\n<P>One of the members of this group could not attend the reunion for medical reasons. She had to go to the Solol\u00e1 hospital.\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Spanish by Evelyn Garcia, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\n<P>Dentro D. las muchas cualidades que tienen las clientas D. L. ComUnidad del Tul (t\u00e9rmino que utiliza Friendship Bridge para describir a un Banco Comunal) hay una que cabe destacar, L. armon\u00eda que se vive entre las dos distintas etnias: Mayas Kachikeles y ladinas (descendientes D. Europeos) que constituyen el grupo. Es remarcable ver a se\u00f1oras que pertenecen a distintas culturas trabajar, organizarse y llevarse tan bien. Est\u00e1 caracter\u00edstica sale a relucir sobre todo cuando L. Junta Directiva, compuesta por se\u00f1oras ladinas y Mayas Kachikeles, trabajan juntas D. una manera armoniosa y eficiente. \r\n\r\n<P>L. gran mayor\u00eda D. se\u00f1oras fueron tejedoras antes D. recibir su primer pr\u00e9stamo en Friendship Bridge. Muchas D. ellas ayudaban a sus madres a bordar huipiles (traje tradicional Guatemalteco). Sin embargo, con el pr\u00e9stamo que van a recibir D. Kiva, nuestras clientas han escogido cambiar D. rumbo hacia uno m\u00e1s prospero. \r\n\r\n<P>En estos momentos, las mujeres del Tul est\u00e1n invirtiendo su dinero en una variedad D. actividades econ\u00f3micas. Por ejemplo, CarmeL. S. ha estado invirtiendo su pr\u00e9stamo en una tienda D. juguetes, MicaeL. J. en su tienda D. consumo diario, Rosa Ajpuac en su panader\u00eda, Blanca U. en su tienda D. velas y adornos. Irma C., va a invertir su dinero para comprar 300 gallos y gallinas los cuales los compra a cuarenta quetzales y luego los revenD. a 60 quetzales. Finalmente, otra iniciativa interesante es L. D.

Her income from fishing and fish mongering is pretty decent. However, her business will run better if she has better tools. She talked to her family and decided to borrow 400 USD to buy more fishing tools so that her fishing business will be more effective.

Sari Group","description":{"languages":["id"],"texts":{"id":"Kemuning Sari is a hog farming group situated in the highland of Manistutu village, West Bali. Most of the people are farmers whose incomes are declining due to cocoa plantation failing to yield properly   and due to the rice paddy fields not generating enough earning because of the raising fertilizer's cost. Some of the community members, who are mostly housewives, decide to help their husband generating more income for the family. They form a group named Kemuning Sari. The members agree to give the name of Kemuning Sari to represent the name of their hamlet of Kemuning and to reflect the Balinese belief of 'Sari' which means 'blessing'. They hope that the animals would grow very well as blessed and bring prosperity. Since they have a strong desire and very little capital, they requested for a loan from Dinari Foundation. Dinari then provides training and guidance on how to raise hogs, how to handle and prevent diseases, how to provide good animal feed, and how to manage the financial aspect of hog farming. After they felt comfortable, the group's officers are formed. Ni Putu Miyarni is the chair person, Ni Ketut Budiani is the treasurer, Ni Wayan Suriani is the secretary and there are ten other  members.  The loan will be used to purchase high quality piglets and animal feed. They hope that the earning will grow rapidly so they can improve the economic condition of their families. \r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Bahasa Indonesia by Arliadi Mahadi, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\n\r\nKemuning Sari sebuah kelompok ternak babi yang berlokasi didataran tinggi desa Manistutu, Bali Barat. Sebagian besar masyarakatnya bekerja sebagai petani yang penghasilannya sekarang sedang menurun karena tanaman coklat tidak berbuah dengan baik dan juga sawah yang dimiliki tidak menghasilkan dengan maksimal karena harga pupuk naik dengan drastis. Sehingga anggota kelompok yang sebagian besar ibu-ibu mempunyai keinginan untuk membantu penghasilan suaminya. Maka mereka membentuk sebuah kelompok.  Nama ini diberikan karena sesuai dengan persetujuan anggota,bahwa tempat kelompok berada di dusun Kemuning sedangkan Sari sesuai dengan keyakinan orang Bali bahwa Sari itu berarti berkat. Sehingga nantinya semua ternak yang dipelihara oleh anggota supaya di berkati dan berkembang dengan baik. Karena keinginan yang begitu besar dari anggota untuk menjalankan usaha dibidang beternak babi ,sedangkan modal yang dimiliki  sedikit hanya cukup untuk memelihara babi lokal,maka mereka mengajukan permohonan untuk pembinaan dan pinjaman modal ke Yayasan Dinari. Oleh Dinari kemudian diberikan pembinaan bagaimana beternak yang bagus, cara mengatasi penyakit secara tepat dan cepat, pemberian pakan yang baik,dan juga pengaturan keuangan agar modal untuk memelihara babi tidak dipakai untuk keperluan yang lainnya. Setelah semua dirasa cukup maka dibentuklah sebuah kepengurusan kelompok dimana yang menjabat sebagai ketua adalah Ni Putu Miyarni,Bendahara : Ni Ketut Budiani,Sektretaris : Ni Wayan Suriani dan anggota berjumlah 10 orang, kemudian Yayasan Dinari memberikan pinjaman modal. Modal ini oleh anggota ada yang dipakai untuk membeli bibit unggul  dan ada juga yang dipakai untuk membeli pakan ternak yang berkwalitas. Dengan harapan keuntungan yang diperoleh menjadi bertambah dari pada memelihara babi lokal, sehingga ekonomi keluarga merekapun bisa menjadi lebih baik dari pada sekarang ini. Mereka sangat berterimakasih kepada Yayasan Dinari atas pinjaman modal ini,sehingga anggota Kemuning Sari dapat mengembangkan usahanya dibidang beternak babi."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1425,"image":{"id":133818,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To

So, in order to satisfy the burgeoning demand of her customers, she's requesting financing to buy a vast field of cassava, so as to have a major reserve of raw materials.  The profits derived from this business will be made available to destitute families, so they may survive. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva

Both help her with home chores when there\u2019s no work and classes.\r\n\r\nAlicia is raising pigs to get income to support her and the children, especially their education. She has been both mother and father to them since she and her husband parted ways years ago for domestic reasons she opted to keep to herself. Life was hard for her then, but she was able to cope and move on thanks to her faith in the Almighty. She found consolation in getting into business. She also sells fresh pork meat. She brings her pigs to the butcher when they are ready for slaughtering. Alicia also cooks meals and sells them to customers. She earns more than 45,000 PHP a month from these business activities.\r\n\r\nShe became a member of the Center for Community Transformation (CCT) Credit Cooperative in 2005. She applied for a new loan with the cooperative in the amount of 20,000 PHP to have available funds for the renovation of her pig pen. She would like to extend her pen because her pigs are now crammed inside it. She only used to have six pigs. Now, she already has nine mother pigs and many growing baby pigs.\r\n\r\nAlicia hopes to acquire a farm lot where she can build a bigger pig farm complex. She also wishes to build an apartment. She dreams to see her sons living happily with their own families. She is very thankful to the Almighty for giving her two loving sons. She considers them as gift from heaven.\r\n\r\nAbout CCT\r\n\r\nThe Center for Community Transformation (CCT) is an organized Christian response against poverty and social injustice.  This is carried out through the fusion of social development initiatives and evangelical mission in a uniquely Filipino context.

She lives in her own home, and what he most desires is to have a relaxing old age. Each day, she gets up very early to open her grocery store.

It is located in the state of Mexico in Mexico.  The group is comprised of 13 members.  This is the first time they have asked CrediCom\u00fan for a loan.\r\n\r\nCarolina Cristina Casta\u00f1eda Garc\u00eda is the treasurer of the group.  She is 31 years old, and she attended school until her second year of high school.  She is a merchant.  She has two children, a son and a daughter.  She sells cooking utensils and cosmetics.  She started two years ago.  \r\n\r\nShe is requesting a loan to stock more cooking utensils and cosmetics.  Her customers say that she started her sales by selling door to door to get to know them and what they like to buy from her.  She is very reliable about delivering the products.  Because of the confidence they have in her they prefer to buy from her instead of other places.\r\n\r\nShe started the business because her mother-in-law suggested that she sell.  She started with cosmetics, and from there she saw the option of selling cooking utensils.  She saw that her customers were asking her for cooking utensils.\r\n\r\nAt the time of requesting this loan she feels motivated and happy because she knows that she will be able to do well.  She wants this loan to be able to start the construction of a place in her house.  This is for her customers to have a place where they can buy her products.  It is also so that her business will grow.  She hopes that the sales increase will allow her to keep providing an education to her children and will help with the expansion of her house.\r\n\r\nThe other members of the group are:\r\n\r\nYAZMIN H.L.

Oaxaca, 40 minutes to the north of Pinotepa nacional. The name of the group is in the language of Mixteca and means \u2018hill of lianas\u2019 (a kind of vine). The majority of the population is indigenous and works in the fields and, in the case of the women, makes embroidery and artisanal textiles. The woman that represents the group is Flora M. C., but we will not talk about her much, since this story is focused on Herminia Nicol\u00e1s M., a 35-year-old woman married to 42-year-old Gracian, an agricultural worker. They have four children: Guadalupe (18), Claudia (16), \u00c1lvaro (15) and Azucena (13). Only the last three study, since the eldest works to help them pay for school expenses.   Herminia works in the elaboration of textiles in the traditional style, which is very laborious, but poorly remunerated.  She learned this traD. from a very young age as one of the ways to help alleviate the needs of her family. She makes her craftwork in her home, as is the custom, and uses coarse materials maD. in the traditional way.  It is very common to find artisanal women in this zone since, apart from selling their creations, the women also wear them.\r\n\r\nHerminia is a member of the loan group organized near her house, and she sought the resources to buy the materials that she will use to make her embroidery. With this money, she was able to buy cotton thread in the colors of white, blue, green, red, orange and purple as well as cotton skeins that they use to make textiles, crystal worsted yarn and the traditional brown thread that is maD. artisanally in this region by hand with brown colored cotton. She also sent to be renovated some of her instruments\u2019 parts that she uses for the weaving of textiles and also to make napkins, tablecloths, huipiles (traditional embroidered dresses), and textiles for christening robes. In this December season, Herminia is filling some orders that were maD. ahead of time that will be for wedding souvenirs. \r\n\r\nThe big dream that Herminia has is that her children grow up in an environment without a lot of need, and the only thing that she asks is to have good health in order to be able to continue ahead in the fight for a better tomorrow. She would like to have a better house that has a solid floor and is a little stronger so as to be able to withstand the ravages of nature in the periods of rain. \r\n\r\nYukuyoo is a group of working women. They help one another and always have the necessary trust so that the group and its members are punctual with their payments. The only thing we can add is a gesture of thanks on behalf of this group to those that represent this industry of dreams. Thanks to those that support Kiva, to Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad and to the people that dedicate themselves ever day to making possible the projects of many. The women that make up the \u201cYukuyoo\u201d group are listed below, as well as the activities they carry out.  \r\n\r\nFlora M.
