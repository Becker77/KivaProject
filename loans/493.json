Her sister is younger than Jessica and depends on her since their mother passed away and their father has neglected her since she was a young child.\r\n\r\nWhat Jessica likes best about her work is that she has time for some other activities.

She has a husband and two adult daughters.  Galina is involved in selling spare parts for agricultural machinery.  Her husband actively helps her with this business because he knows machinery very well.  They have been working in this field for 11 years.  Galina plans to invest money, received from Kiva, into a purchase of a land plot for a store.  She has already reached an agreement with the village council to purchase the land and plans to complete this transaction prior to the New Year's, while the laws remain unchanged.  The land, that Galina wants to purchase, is located in the center of Znamenka, right across from the market, with practically all village stores surrounding it.  There, Galina and her husband plan to continue selling auto parts for farm machinery, but also want to build a small kiosk nearby to sell food products.  Galina hopes that this deal will happen, and that the land will belong to them because then they would not longer have to pay for a large lease, and no one would be able to take away their land or force them out."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2625,"image":{"id":963886,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Spare

He uses the yield he produces from his farm to take care of his family of 10.  Jamilu has been farming from a very young age and although he has years of experience, his inability to access the right inputs such as high-quality seeds and fertilizers has seen years of below average yields from his maize farm.  A Babban Gona loan of $485 would help Jamilu see improvements in his crops by providing him with seeds and fertilizers while allowing him the means to store his crops and the ability to sell them at a premium market price.  By receiving a Babban Gona loan, Jamilu has the opportunity to reap yields and earn profits three times as high as the average Nigerian farmer.\n\nWith the technical training he has received from Babban Gona, Jamilu can envision a future where he is better able to provide for his large family.  He has the chance to see his children obtain a good education and maintain a healthier lifestyle, as his farm continues to grow and eventually moves from subsistence farming to commercial scale farming."}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1308591,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Innovative Loans"],"use":"To buy fertilizers, seeds, and agricultural technologies to increase maize yields","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NG","country":"Nigeria","town":"Kaduna","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"10 8","type":"point"}},"partner_id":288,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":500,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jamilu","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NGN","disbursal_amount":76529.1,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":18,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76529.1}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":500}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":790197,"name":"Calleb","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Calleb is a married man with children living in Kyenjojo, Uganda. \r\n\r\nHe is a farmer and a cattle trader, buying and selling cattle in various markets in the rural areas and urban areas.

They believe this because they are responsible parents who work very hard at farming so their children can finish school, an opportunity they never had because they were so poor. Mutabar has worked in agriculture since her wedding, and with the unconditional help of her husband, also buys and sells sheep to meet the family\u2019s other needs. Despite this, she now finds herself with more expenses than expected, and would like a loan to increase the size of her flock. Mutabar and her family are hoping for a favorable response to their request. \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. A civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged an already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

In the meantime, she plans to continue to enjoy spending time with her only son.\r\n\r\nAna plans to use this loan to invest in her jewelry business, by buying rings, bracelets, chains and other accessories. She will also buy clothes. She will use the profits to invest in her business and she dreams of improving it and being able to build her house and buy some furniture. She has had five loans and she is excited to have this new loan and give one step forward to her business improvement.\r\n\r\nAna's story is representative of her group and of Esperanza's Haitian and Dominican clients generally, many of whom recently emigrated to the DR from Haiti.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with access to the varied financial services they need.

She is 52 years old and married with 3 children. \r\n\r\nRosa was born into an ordinary family. She was the eldest child; she had five brothers and sisters.  Most of her time was devoted to household chores: looking after younger brothers and sisters, housework, and farm work.  As a child, Rosa dreamed of becoming a police officer to protect the innocent and bring justice. After high school, Rose went to military school, then filed documents to apply for a higher education. After graduation, in Soviet times, fate sent Rosa to serve in neighboring Kyrgyzstan, where she met her future husband. Thus, in 1988, our heroine got married, and a year later the newlywed had a daughter. Since both husband and wife were in the military, life threw them from place to place in rented apartments. \r\n\r\nWhile her husband served his country, the years passed and the family grew to five people. \"We have not had time to look around, and it's time to retire,\"  said Rosa. The couple had been saving for a house for fifteen years, and in 2008 they bought a house in the city center of Karabalta.  With the 10,000 som  they had left, Rosa decided to buy some products and try to resell them.  The first batch went well. Rosa realized that she was able to work in trade and selling in the market. For three years, Rosa has increased her turnover to 60,000 som and was able to pay for tuition at the university for her eldest daughter. To further increase sales and expand the variety of goods she sells, Rose turned to the company Bai - Tushum and Partners for a loan of 100,000 som (KGS). She wants to use proceeds from this money to open more shops. \r\n\r\nBai-Tushum and Partners uses Kiva funding to target the especially vulnerable population. Bai-Tushum and Partners is one of the leading Microfinance Institutions in Kyrgyzstan. As a reliable financial partner, Bai-Tushum contributes to the economic development of the Kyrgyz Republic through the delivery of microfinance services in rural and urban areas that lead to increased employment and meet the interests of its clients and investors.

chickens being sold for lunch, sit 28 women under the shade of an avocado tree.  Shifting periodically to avoid the sun's glare as it tracks across the sky, the women of the Belen communal bank are perched on rocks, steps or sitting flat on the ground, waiting for their meeting to begin.  They have come from all over their town of Cerro de Oro, by foot, tuc tuc, or bus, to this central spot where they have been meeting once a month for the past seven years.  Surrounded by poverty, this avocado tree brings them hope with each meeting.  It is under this tree that they receive their loans from Friendship Bridge and learn how to best invest to change their futures.  \r\n\r\n<P>The majority of the 28 women are artisans, born and raised in a region known for its beautiful weavings. Of the 28 women, 11 are asking for a loan of 32,500 quetzales ($4,275), ranging from $300 to $400 per person.  All of these women will invest their loans in weaving and embroidery businesses, purchasing thread and fabric for intricate huipiles (traditional woven blouses, like the ones in the picture), skirts, scarves, and blankets.  The supplies they purchase come from the nearby town of Santiago de Atitl\u00e1n.  One woman also sells firewood, the main source of fuel in the area, to supplement her weaving business.  She will use about 25% of her loan to invest in firewood.\r\n\r\n<P>Long before the monthly meetings under the avocado tree, the women of Belen worked long days in the factories of other weavers, earning meager incomes that could barely provide food or shelter for their families.  Since joining Friendship Bridge, all 28 women have become their own bosses, opening their own businesses,  employing as many as five other women in turn. They are also teaching their daughters the trade, which is an important aspect of the Atitl\u00e1n culture.  However, their dreams go further for their children.  Their children all attend the local school, and their mothers dream that they will learn to read and write, acquiring knowledge of other things, so that someday they can break free from the struggles of their parents and enter a world full of opportunity."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4275,"image":{"id":134642,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Weaving","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"To

He earns R1600 per month (around US$ 200) and is able to save a bit from time to time. His wife Angelica also works in one of the houses as a cleaning lady and earns R600 (about US$ 70) monthly. Narcisio and Angelica live in a room in the back of one of the houses, mainly because Narcisio is also in charge of security. Their children sleep in a house Narcisio is building, but spend most part of the day with them.<P>\r\n\r\nNarcisio first approached Hluvuku in 2000 asking for a loan to start a grocery stand. As the value requested was denied, Narcisio decided to postpone the idea. In 2005 he bought a piece of land and decided to start building a house, so he asked again for a loan to buy construction material, which was approved. This is Narcisio\u2019s third loan and will still be used to buy construction material. The house is almost ready; this time he will buy some missing windows and doors. Before borrowing though Hluvuku, Narcisio used to ask his boss to lend him money, but the boss would make him pay at once, normally deducting from his salary, and that was too much for him. Hluvuku in his opinion is very good because he repays an amount he can afford every month and still has money to support his family.<P>\r\n\r\nIn the future, Narcisio intends to ask for a new loan to keep improving the house and once it is ready, he hopes to start building 2 others, as he already has other land close to his house. He dreams about giving each of his children a house to live in. <P>\r\n\r\nThe picture shows Narcisio with his 9-year-old daughter

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility.

Jupilier is requesting a new loan of 20,000 PHP, which will be used to repair an existing vehicle for better service. \r\n\r\nThis loan will be the fourth loan taken out by Jupilier from GDMPC. He plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of his family. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three units offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte, and Misamis Occidental.

S\u00e1nchez is 27 years old and has four children between the ages of 2 and 12.  Their names are Yusbania Lizbeth Hern\u00e1ndez, Sara Abigail Suazo, Danilo Jos\u00e9 D., and L\u00e1zaro Josu\u00e9 D..  Except for the youngest, they are all in school.  She and her partner work together.  One of her aspirations is to have her own stall where she can offer her products instead of selling her products as a street vendor.  Another hope of hers is to be able to offer her children a good education so that in the future they can be self-supporting professionals.\r\n\r\nKarla\u2019s business, which she has had for 9 years, is selling plastic bags in the market at the terminal.  She took over the business that her mother had established when Karla was a little girl.  When her mother became ill and could no longer work, Karla did not want to let the business fall so she decided to experiment with the situation.  She continued selling to her mother\u2019s customers and she also was able to add new clients.  She thinks that some day she will be able to get her own vending stall with a good inventory.  The way she plans to use her loan is to buy a greater variety of bags of all sizes to offer to her customers.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Melissa Hays, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":218325,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Plastics Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Purchase merchandise","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Leon","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.435556 -86.879444","type":"point"}},"partner_id":96,"posted_date":"2008-11-09T22:00:23Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":500,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Karla Vanesa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-11-24T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":9500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":1357.14},{"due_date":"2009-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":1357.14},{"due_date":"2009-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":1357.14},{"due_date":"2009-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1357.14},{"due_date":"2009-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1357.14},{"due_date":"2009-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1357.14},{"due_date":"2009-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1357.16}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":71.43},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":71.43},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":71.43},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":71.43},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.43},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.43},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.42}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":71.43,"local_amount":1357.14,"processed_date":"2008-12-24T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-15T22:24:44Z","rounded_local_amount":1388.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9935111},{"amount":71.43,"local_amount":1357.14,"processed_date":"2009-01-24T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T12:37:36Z","rounded_local_amount":1388.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14858608},{"amount":71.43,"local_amount":1357.14,"processed_date":"2009-02-24T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T08:41:57Z","rounded_local_amount":1388.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20399865},{"amount":71.43,"local_amount":1357.14,"processed_date":"2009-03-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T18:36:41Z","rounded_local_amount":1388.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27091848},{"amount":71.42,"local_amount":1357.14,"processed_date":"2009-04-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T16:39:56Z","rounded_local_amount":1388.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35985255},{"amount":71.43,"local_amount":1357.14,"processed_date":"2009-05-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T23:10:48Z","rounded_local_amount":1388.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44445864},{"amount":71.43,"local_amount":1357.16,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T20:41:54Z","rounded_local_amount":1388.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52956517}],"funded_date":"2008-11-11T02:33:58Z","paid_date":"2009-07-15T20:41:54Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Melissa Hays","image":null}},{"id":75790,"name":"Lai","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Lai V. is 51 years old and she now lives in Lvea Sor Kandal village in Kandal Province.

Her daughters are also single mothers and are very supportive of her. For the past ten years, Irma had been selling fish from a stand at the local market. She had a very good relationship with her clients, and one of them put her in touch with the American owners of the Inguirilla plant, where she started working two years ago. In order to supplement her earnings, she also sells sodas to her coworkers, which is going very well for her. Her bosses let her carry out this business without any trouble as long as she doesn't neglect her work duties. This is very profitable for her, because she sells a large number of sodas each day. \r\n\r\nThis is Irma's fifth loan from Microfinanzas Prisma. Her favorite part of village bank membership is that her fellow group members are understanding, united, and show great solidarity amongst themselves.

She lives in her own house, and what she wants the most is to improve her quality of life.  She has a business doing metal work.  In her workshop, she molds the metal and coverts it into diverse forms like wheelbarrows, desks, chairs, etc.  She also repairs broken things to generate extra income.  She currently works with an assistant, who does the work that requires more physical effort.  What she likes the most about her job is fixing broken things that people bring her because she fixes them very well even though she is a woman.  She has done this work for 15 years, and the thing that she likes the least is having to obtain metals to mold because transporting them is hard and tiring.  This is Simona's third loan with Microfinanzas Prisma, and just like with her other loans, she is willing to make all of her payments on time.  She is very loved in her communal bank because she always worries about others' well-being.

Gaudencia is married and has 3 adult-aged children. \r\n<p>\r\nTo make a living, Gaudencia owns and operates a business venture in the retail sector running a sari-sari (variety) retail store. Although not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from selling both food and daily use products in the local community. Gaudencia has been engaged in her business for over 30 years and earns approximately 3,500 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2008, Gaudencia joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Gaudencia has successfully repaid a previous loan of 17,000 PHP from HSPFI. Gaudencia is requesting a new loan of 20,000 PHP which will be used to expand her business. This loan will be the 6th loan taken out by Gaudencia from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement her family's income. \r\n<p>\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n<p>\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n<p>\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, we created this template for our field staff to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate

The 7 group members live in Pococi, Limon, a rural region located near the Caribbean coast of Costa Rica. The women in this group are involved in various entrepreneurial productive activities including: clothing and jewellery sales as well as sewing and bread-making (and selling). This loan will be used to make general investments conducive to the expansion of business activities by purchasing clothing, jewellery, and materials necessary for bread-making and sewing clothes. The group members engaged in clothing sales contact suppliers, make clothing purchases and sell clothes to members of the Pococi community. The other members produce clothing and bread in their homes to sell at a later date. \r\n\r\nSome of the members engaged in bread-making aspire to one day open their own bakery. In general the group hopes this loan will assist them in improving their standard of living; specifically, the members would like to be able to invest in a higher level of education. A main obstacle for the members of this group has been the lack of available financial services in their community. This loan will extend the reach of business loans to a group of hard-working entrepreneurs living in a poor Costa Rican community. \r\n\r\nThe Women\u00b4s Bank in Search of Success was formed in July of 2009. This loan will be the group's second with Fundaci\u00f3n Mujer. The loan consultant who has been working with the group members over the past 7 months describes these women as hard-working, entrepreneurial-minded individuals who aspire to improve living conditions for themselves and their families. The women work together well and have exhibited responsibility and punctuality with respect to past loans. \r\n\r\nIn general, there is ample demand for the products sold by the women of this group. The members have successfully used their first loan to build their client base. They are happy and excited to now be applying for a larger loan amount than they have in the past. \r\n\r\nFor the members, the name of this group symbolizes the possibility of succeeding in life and the goal of becoming self-sufficient."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2550,"image":{"id":493603,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing

Ever since she was a girl she has worked in agriculture.  Her parents taught her how to farm.  Even now farming is an important source of income for her family.\r\n\r\nShe currently works managing the income.  She also sells animals, and she sells milk that her cows produce.  She mainly grows corn and potatoes.  When she needs to plant or harvest, she hires workers for these jobs.  Once the production is collected, it is taken to sell in the city of Lima.\r\n\r\nShe also works as an administrator in an educational center that is very close to her house.  She only works half days, and this gives her time to take care of her crops.  Later, she wishes to improve the production of her harvests.\r\n\r\nThis is her 17th loan with MFP.

Magalona, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating 2 business ventures: fishing and a ready-to-wear business. Her husband Ramie B., who is 30 years old, works as a fisherman to earn income. They have 4 children between 11 to 15 years old, who are currently going to school. \r\n\r\nJennifer joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2008 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 4 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Jennifer has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 12,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 3,500, uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 5th loan, she is borrowing PHP 17,000, which she intends to use to purchase fishing nets so that she can continue to save up for future family needs and for her children's education. Jennifer is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

A motisha loan is a product offered by Tujijenge Tanzania that allows borrowers with good credit ratings to pay back their original loans faster and receive extra money before their original loan term has ended. \r\n<p>\r\nChristina will share this loan with her loan group. The group is called \u201cMungu Tubariki\u201d and has eight members who will hold each other accountable for paying back their loans.\r\n<p>\r\nChristina hopes to buy and sell more second-hand clothing, sarongs and fabric. With her profits she will pay for her children's school fees, and one day, she hopes to build her own home.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1375,"image":{"id":788711,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing

It is more profitable to sell in the further zones, because the people there don\u2019t have easy access to travel to the city to shop, and in other cases they have very restricted economic resources.  But in order to help her neighbors, Candelaria tries to have various items from the same factories, where she buys for a better price and sells to her clients at lower prices.  In the future, she wants to have a store where she could sell her items and other products in order to be on time completing services for her clients, at the moment this is the only company that she has.

He has been working in the market for 2 years. Once a month he travels to the neighboring city Istaravshan to purchase new goods.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n<p><br>\r\nIMON's History<br><br>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The official name of this borrowing group is 17 (017 Qu\u1ea3ng H\u01b0ng).\r\n\r\nTuy\u1ebft  is married and has two school-aged children.

Tuy\u1ebft has been engaged in this business for over five years and earns approximately $84 a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2004, Tuy\u1ebft  joined Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Tuy\u1ebft  has successfully repaid a previous loan of 3079800 VND from Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women.  This previous loan was used to invest in renovating the business.  She is now requesting a new loan of 6000000 VND which will also be used to invest in renovating the business.  This will be her ninth loan from Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women.

lotion and underwear in her community. She is 44 years old, married and has five school-aged children. They are from the village of Minallo, Naguilian, Isabela. Josephine has been in her business for over three years and earns approximately 5,000 Philippine pesos (PHP) a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Josephine joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living conditions and enable her to engage in business activities. Josephine has successfully repaid a previous loan of 18,000 PHP from ASKI which was used to purchase products to sell. Josephine is requesting a new loan of 22,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This will be her seventh loan from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue to improve and expand her business. \r\n\r\nJosephine is the leader of a 12 member group accessing a loan offered by ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members, if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is \"Josephine P.\".\r\n\r\n<b>About ASKI:<\/b>\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the central and northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n<i>Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

She seeks this loan to increase her supply of carrots, cabbages, peppers, eggplants, etc. Since she is a widow and the breadwinner of the family, she needs a higher profit margin to be able to provide her family with food.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":125,"image":{"id":806922,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy vegetables (cabbages, carrots, eggplants, peppers) for sale at the market.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SN","country":"Senegal","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"14 -14","type":"point"}},"partner_id":108,"posted_date":"2011-07-20T07:20:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":125,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Fatou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-06-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":5000},{"due_date":"2011-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":5000},{"due_date":"2011-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":5000},{"due_date":"2011-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":5000},{"due_date":"2011-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":5000},{"due_date":"2011-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":5000},{"due_date":"2012-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":5000},{"due_date":"2012-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":5000},{"due_date":"2012-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":5000},{"due_date":"2012-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":5000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":12.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":12.5,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T09:34:22Z","rounded_local_amount":5660.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221754319},{"amount":12.5,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T10:29:34Z","rounded_local_amount":5660.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227123284},{"amount":12.5,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T10:18:15Z","rounded_local_amount":5660.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232885195},{"amount":12.5,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2011-10-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T11:27:20Z","rounded_local_amount":5660.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238703320},{"amount":12.5,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T11:19:34Z","rounded_local_amount":5660.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244660487},{"amount":12.5,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T11:30:04Z","rounded_local_amount":5660.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250881211},{"amount":12.5,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:57:34Z","rounded_local_amount":5660.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257290813},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T11:12:34Z","rounded_local_amount":16982.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263433075}],"funded_date":"2011-07-20T08:13:53Z","paid_date":"2012-03-15T11:12:34Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Robert Mouris","image":538858}},{"id":318396,"name":"Gulnara","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Gulnara is 47, widowed, and has four children.

She sells from her home and as an itinerant vendor, to both men and women customers, for cash only.\r\n\r\nShe envisions average monthly profits of 22,500 FCFA, part of which will be used to pay off the loan and interest, and the rest put into savings. She wants to increase her turnover to better satisfy her customers."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":938608,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing","sector":"Clothing","themes":["Rural

He did well enough with his first loan that he can now take out a much larger loan. With the last loan he was able to increase his business capital, and now he looks to do the same with this loan. Julius has a variety of customers ranging from school children to his adult neighbors, and believes he does so well because he is a unique suit specialist in his area. <P>\r\n\r\nJulius notes that he sews uniforms for Mjangi groups in his community. Theses groups exist to provide financial services to their members. They meet regularly and everyone contributes dues to the group. At each meeting a different person will receive the group's dues, a variation of micro-finance. Julius caters to these groups who often purchase uniforms from him.<P>\r\n \r\nWith the profits from this loan, Julius will help pay his children's school fees. He also plans to put away money for medical emergencies. He will also use part of his profits to put back into his business, as he did this with his last loan.

They do not have children. Leena runs a video show and sells cereals like maize and beans. She shows Christian movies in a small shop, charging 5 shillings each. The programs usually last one hour.\r\n<p>\r\nLeena hopes to use the loan to improve her business by buying a fan for the video shop and a fridge for sodas and water. She says she is not facing any big challenges right now. In her free time, she likes to read storybooks and watch movies. Leena heard about K-MET from her friends.\r\n<p>\r\nIn this video, you can hear me greet Leena saying \"Idhi Nade\", which is Luo for \"How are you?\" Leena responds, \"Adhi maber,\" meaning \"very good.\" Most people living in Kisumu descend from the Luo tribe, the same tribe as Obama's father. At the end, you will hear me fluctuate between Kiswahili and Luo saying \"Asante Sana\" in Kiswahili, meaning \"thank you\" and \"Erokamano\", which in Luo means \"thank you.\" The voices you hear in the background are people coming for a weekly K-MET borrower meeting. To see what one looks like, check out the first video in <a href=\"http:\/\/fellowsblog.kiva.org\/2009\/05\/14\/m-banking\/\" target=\"_blank\">this blog post.<\/a>\r\n\r\nK-MET, the NGO distributing the loan, is unique in that it is not a traditional MFI. Rather, it is a development corporation focused on raising health standards in Kenya.

What she likes most about her Community Bank is the savings plan.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Daniel Burke, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":448397,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy a cow","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Puno, Puno","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15.833333 -70.033333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":72,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":525,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Olga","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-12-11T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":1500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":525}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Daniel Burke","image":11816}},{"id":166218,"name":"Adelayda","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Adelayda tiene 38 a\u00f1os de edad, es casada y junto a su pareja tienen 2 hijos a su cargo.

The citizens of this town are hardworking people and most of them have their own livestock and work in the fields.\r\n\r\nOne of these citizens is Jumabubu O. a sixty-one-year-old widow who brought up five children: three of them are daughters and two are sons and now all live separately with their husbands and wives.\r\n\r\nJumabubu\u2019s husband was also hardworking and they bought a cow with their savings. Later on they sold it and bought two cows with the proceeds. Unfortunately, as life is an unpredictable thing, her husband died from a heart attack, leaving all his children and the little farm on Jumabubu\u2019s brittle shoulders.\r\n\r\nNowadays, Jumabubu is a caring grandmother who has her little farm. She does animal husbandry and sells milk and also rears cattle. She has expanded her livestock and has already married off her children. Now she wants to marry off her grandchildren as well.\r\n\r\nThirty years ago, nobody thought that this family, with 15,000 soms ($340) in their pocket, would succeed one day, especially after their grief, but they did. Now her profit is 11,500 soms ($262).\r\n\r\nJumabubu wants to obtain a loan to buy ten sheep to raise and sell.\r\n\r\nGulnara S. is forty and is married with four children: two sons and two daughters. Her elder children attend the local school and the younger one is a preschooler. She wants to give a high level of education to her children and to buy a big house as well. Her husband transports passengers.\r\n\r\nNow, Gulnara sells milk and breeds cattle. Everything started with 10,000 soms ($228) which they got from selling their harvest and which they used to buy a cow. Now they already bought a car, a tractor and have increased their head of livestock. With the loan they will buy a heifer to raise.\r\n\r\nKuldjamilya K. is a fifty-four-year-old widow who has three daughters and a son. Her elder daughters are married and live separately; her younger daughter works in the shop and her son is busy about the house. Her children already received an education.\r\n\r\nKuldjamilya is a seamstress, making national garments. About forty years ago for cost of about 5,000 soms ($114) she and her husband bought a heifer. Now, from selling milk and other items, they earn 2,100 soms ($43) per month. They are planning to increase their head of livestock and to build a barn and a fence. The loan will be used to buy a heifer to raise.\r\n\r\nArsygulbek M. is a married man at the age of forty nine. He has five children to whom he wants to give a good education and he also wants to buy a house. Three of his children are sons and two are daughters. His spouse is a housewife. His elder daughter is married, the second one works in the garment factory, his son is busy about the house and the youngest ones go to the local school.\r\n\r\nArsygulbek\u2019s wife and son always help and encourage him. They sell milk and look after cattle while he works as a taxi driver. A few years ago they bought a cow for 12,000 ($273) and thus they started their business. Now their profit is 8,400 soms ($190) per month. Arsygulbek wants to obtain a loan to increase the total number of their cattle.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>======================================\r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---<\/b>\r\n<br>This loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance, a young and ambitious socially-focused MFI in Kyrgyzstan.\r\n<br>Mol Bulak Finance is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development on the basis of the 3-Ps concept - People (building human capital and taking care of its customers and the society as well), Profit (to be profitable in order to grow further) and the Planet (taking care of the environment).

Rachidatou is thus asking for a third loan from ALID\u00e9 in order to strengthen her business and better satisfy her clientele.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Kelly Percival, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":511406,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Purchase of cassava and palm oil","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BJ","country":"Benin","town":"Porto-Novo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"6.483333 2.616667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":104,"posted_date":"2010-03-23T18:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":225,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rachidatou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-04-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":100000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":9090.91},{"due_date":"2010-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":9090.91},{"due_date":"2010-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":9090.91},{"due_date":"2010-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":9090.91},{"due_date":"2010-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":9090.91},{"due_date":"2010-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":9090.91},{"due_date":"2010-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":9090.91},{"due_date":"2010-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":9090.91},{"due_date":"2011-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":9090.91},{"due_date":"2011-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":9090.91},{"due_date":"2011-03-12T08:00:00Z","amount":9090.9}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.45},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.46},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.45},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.46},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.45},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.46},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.45},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.46},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.45},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.46},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.45}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":20.45,"local_amount":9090.91,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T08:40:22Z","rounded_local_amount":9925.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144653279},{"amount":20.46,"local_amount":9090.91,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-20T07:28:47Z","rounded_local_amount":9925.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151835486},{"amount":20.45,"local_amount":9090.91,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T09:10:07Z","rounded_local_amount":9925.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159575883},{"amount":20.46,"local_amount":9090.91,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-30T08:15:02Z","rounded_local_amount":9925.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166954397},{"amount":20.45,"local_amount":9090.91,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-30T08:51:27Z","rounded_local_amount":9925.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172056055},{"amount":48.93,"local_amount":21745.45,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-28T09:31:19Z","rounded_local_amount":23740.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177347589},{"amount":12.44,"local_amount":5527.28,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-05T09:07:04Z","rounded_local_amount":6034.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188617496},{"amount":20.45,"local_amount":9090.91,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T08:09:20Z","rounded_local_amount":9925.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191360915},{"amount":20.46,"local_amount":9090.91,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-28T09:13:25Z","rounded_local_amount":9925.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195779604},{"amount":20.45,"local_amount":9090.9,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-16T08:07:53Z","rounded_local_amount":9925.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201401514}],"funded_date":"2010-03-23T19:39:28Z","paid_date":"2011-04-16T08:07:53Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kelly Percival","image":null}},{"id":191385,"name":"Silas","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Silas is 31 years old and married with one child.

She is the one with her hand raised, in front of the red door. On her 16th loan, she is 36 years old, married and the mother six children, four of whom attend school.  The other two children are not old enough to attend school yet.  Her husband is a businessman who deals in lumber.  \r\n\r\nMangaza K. helps her husband in the lumber business.  She began her small business with her own money that she received from her husband.  Her starting capital was $50.  Her business was to sell boards along the Katindo road at Afia Bora. She has been selling lumber for 12 years.  Before settling in the town of Goma, Mangaza K. sold beer in Kalehe, a village located in the south of Kivu, 180 km from the town of Goma. \r\n\r\nWith her loan from the IMF Hekima, Riziki Chahi hopes to increase her turnover by buying 50 boards at $250.\r\n\r\nIn the future, she plans to change to general commerce, given the fact that public environmental and conservation services have taken measures to control the cutting of wood and imposed high taxes to discourage destruction of the environment. \r\n\r\nMangaza K. prefers to increase her savings through the IMF Hekima.  Her ambition is to join the group which offers more operational advantages than the community bank of which she is a member. In addition, she hopes to do some work to her house to make it more comfortable. \r\nMangaza K. thanks the IMF Hekima for the loans she had received without any material backing because, thanks to these loans, she is able to meet the needs of her children.  \r\n\r\nThe group Neema has 18 members, most of whom are women.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Shannon Arnold, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4000,"image":{"id":529146,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Timber Sales","sector":"Construction","themes":["Conflict Zones"],"use":"to buy 50 boards","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CD","country":"Congo (Dem.

They decided to name it thus because that\u2019s the name of the granddaughter of the lady whose house they have their meetings in.  \r\n\r\nThis story is about Virginia In\u00e9s R. M. who is the group representative.  She is 52 years old, a single mother of three children two of whom are already married.  The youngest is 17 and in high school.  Virginia In\u00e9s is a candy vendor at an elementary school near her house and she also sells candy at her house.\r\n\r\nShe chose this activity because being a single mother she had to find a way to support her children so she began with this small business.  The loan she got allowed her to invest in another small business: fast food sales.  Now, she has to buy the ingredients she needs to prepare them like: tomatoes, assorted chilies, onion, garlic, salt, potatoes, carrots, etc.\r\n\r\nHer business is being very useful because she\u2019s using the profits earned to buy school supplies, school uniforms and shoes for her son as well as some personal use items.\r\n\r\nHer store is of great benefit to the children in the school because they don\u2019t have to go outside the school yard to buy what they need so they are protected from any danger besides she sells them her sweets at a very good price.\r\n\r\nVirginia tells us that her goal for the future is that her business grow so that she can earn enough to pay for her son\u2019s higher education because she wants him to continue going to school so that he will have a career and a very good profession.\r\n\r\nShe knows her fellow group members very well and tells us that they are all responsible, hard working, trustworthy people who want to improve themselves and get ahead in life.\r\n\r\nShe is thankful for the help from Kiva, for the trust they have placed in her and for the opportunity she has been given but most of all for believing in her because thanks to the help she got she was able to invest in her business and thus have a better future.\r\n\r\n \r\nThe other group members and their activities are:\r\nAna Mar\u00eda Ariza M.-pastries\r\nCristina virginia G.-cafeteria\r\nAlma Rosa T\u00e9llez R.-bookstore\r\nIn\u00e9s Lourdes A.

They have five children, but only two are living with them in their rental house.  The store that Olinda established was the first in her town.  It opens at 6 in the morning to receive the first early shoppers, who know there is always a variety of merchandise to buy and they will find what they are looking for.  \r\n\r\nWhat she likes most about her work is talking to the customers and learning about what goes on in her town.  She has been in this business for three years and feels that the most difficult part of her job is staying in the store all day without being able to leave.  But she knows that her greatest pastime is agriculture.  She has three patches of farmland that she inherited through her husband.  She grows corn and peas two times a years and obtains a good crop because of her hard work.  \r\n\r\nIn the future she would like to grow her business and give her customers better service.  She belongs to the communal bank \"Victoria\" and this is her second loan through MFP.

He is from the city of Pantaon Ozamis City. To make a living, Cornelio raises crops. His main source of income comes from planting and harvesting root crops and bananas to sell. Cornelio has been engaged in his business for more than 20 years and earns approximately 2,000 PHP a month.\r\n\r\nCornelio joined GDMPC in 2008 to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and his ability to engage in business activities. He has successfully repaid a previous loan of 4,000 PHP from GDMPC. Cornelio is requesting a loan of 6,000 PHP to purchase fertilizer such as manure. This will be Cornelio's third loan from GDMPC. He plans to use the additional revenue generated with this loan to improve the general living conditions of his family.\r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has seven branches covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolks, and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.
