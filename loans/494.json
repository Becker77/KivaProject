Cruz is a member of the communal bank \u201cMujer y Fortaleza\u201d, which is a group of women living in the community of Turi, located about half an hour outside the city of Cuenca in southern Ecuador.  These ladies get along well with one another, spending their meeting time laughing and making jokes. If laughter is the best medicine, then \u201cMujer y Fortaleza\u201d is a very healthy group. They get together to celebrate occasions such as Mother's Day, and they are good members.  They even take turns sweeping the home of the group member who is hosting their regular meeting, which takes place every 2 weeks. \r\n<p>\r\nSra. Cruz is 38 years old, married and the mother of three young children (ages 11, 7, and 4).  The eldest is studying at Fray Vicente Solano School in Cuenca, and the middle child attends Francisco Astudillo School.  Her husband works as a mason. They do not own a home, so they are living with her parents.  Her children spend time with their grandparents since Sra. Cruz works all day.  She spends most of her time in the city washing clothes, but on some days, she comes home early to be with her children and tend to the animals.  Sra. Cruz has a stable home full of happiness.  Everything that she works for goes toward the family expenses.  \r\n<p>\r\nShe raises animals at home and sells them on the weekends at La Feria Libre, a large open market in the city of Cuenca.  She goes to market every 2 to 3 weeks, depending on how many animals she has available to sell.  At the moment, she has few animals because some chickens recently died from an illness and some guinea pigs died from the cold.  Cruz says this is the hardest part of her work.  Even when you invest much time and care into the animals, they sometimes die all the same.  Yet she enjoys her job, spending time with her children, and tending to the animals at home.\r\n<p>\r\nSra. Cruz is requesting $660 to buy chickens to breed and sell.  Her future goal is to own a home, so she is thinking about building a house for her family in this area.  She would also like to plant crops, such as a corn and lettuce.  \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva

She lives in the city of Cuenca, is 51 years old, and is happily married with 8 children, aged 28, 26, 25, 24, 22, 20, 17, and 14. Her first 3 children are married and live on their own with their families. The younger 5 children go to the Antonia \u00c1vila School. Her husband works as the caretaker of a school, living there because they do not have their own house.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda works with her husband at the school. The parents contract her because the school has not yet officially hired her. She has worked there 14 years but has only gotten credit for 13 years, and she is dissatisfied with the low pay. She has been working with the communal bank for 8 years, maintaining a good relationship with all the other members. Thanks to loans from the bank, she has been able to help her children to attend school.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda will use this new loan from FUNDACI\u00d3N ESPOIR for education expenses for the children. She has worked for her children all her life. Mar\u00eda\u2019s dreams are that her children become professional people, and to build her own house.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by jeffrey hersk, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":396305,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Primary\/secondary school costs","sector":"Education","themes":null,"use":"Education expenses for her children","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Cuenca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2009-10-07T12:10:25Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Teresita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":550,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2009-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2009-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2009-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2009-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2009-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2009-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2010-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2010-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2010-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":45.87}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":91.66,"local_amount":91.66,"processed_date":"2009-10-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T21:28:44Z","rounded_local_amount":91.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96947502},{"amount":45.83,"local_amount":45.83,"processed_date":"2009-10-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T21:31:26Z","rounded_local_amount":45.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96947503},{"amount":45.83,"local_amount":45.83,"processed_date":"2009-11-09T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T12:29:49Z","rounded_local_amount":45.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103789358},{"amount":45.83,"local_amount":45.83,"processed_date":"2009-11-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T12:30:26Z","rounded_local_amount":45.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103789359},{"amount":45.83,"local_amount":45.83,"processed_date":"2009-12-07T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T13:27:56Z","rounded_local_amount":45.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110679793},{"amount":45.83,"local_amount":45.83,"processed_date":"2009-12-21T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T13:28:38Z","rounded_local_amount":45.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110679794},{"amount":179.19,"local_amount":179.19,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:33:55Z","rounded_local_amount":179.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118074379},{"amount":4.13,"local_amount":4.13,"processed_date":"2010-02-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:07:25Z","rounded_local_amount":4.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123910399},{"amount":45.87,"local_amount":45.87,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:07:39Z","rounded_local_amount":45.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123910400}],"funded_date":"2009-10-07T15:11:12Z","paid_date":"2010-03-15T10:07:40Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"jeff hersk","image":384019}},{"id":145176,"name":"Neri","description":{"languages":["es"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Nery, pertenece al Banco Comunal \u201cLos Angeles\u201d, Distrito D.

Her prices are very affordable, which is good for her business, since her stand is located in Santiago de Mar\u00eda's market, where there are many other stalls offering the same items as well as other types of clothing, so Mar\u00eda has to offer better prices to attract more customers. Mar\u00eda is requesting a loan to buy lingerie items by the dozen, so that she can obtain lower prices, and also to stock her stand with blouses, shoes and skirts, so that she can offer more clothing to her customers. Mar\u00eda is a very energetic woman who works very hard to help her family get ahead.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Patricia Linderman, Kiva

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

To make a living, Lourdes owns & operates a business venture making & selling food. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from selling peanuts in the community. Lourdes has been engaged in her business for over 10 years and earns approximately 3000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2011, Lourdes joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Lourdes is requesting a loan of 4000 PHP which will be used to purchase raw ingredients needed to make peanut products for sale. This will be the 1st loan taken out by Lourdes from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 38 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":925,"image":{"id":719022,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

married and has one daughter. He has made a living for the past ten years by breeding, fattening and selling large cattle.

Daniel sells a number of items, including palm oil, rice, soft drinks, cigarettes, soaps, toothpaste, sardines, Peak brand powdered milk and more. This will be his very first loan from SMT. He is requesting a loan of Le 3,000,000 to help him strengthen his business.\r\n\r\nWith this loan, Daniel will strengthen his business by buying a refrigerator and a generator. With these machines, Daniel will be able to sell cold drinks. He will buy the machines from neighboring Makeni (30 miles round trip). The refrigerator will cost him Le 1,200,000 and the generator will cost him Le 800,000.\r\n\r\nBusiness had been moving at a slow pace for Daniel, but he is quite sure that with this loan business will start running faster for him.  Sales will increase with the introduction of the new items in his shop. Needless to say, when sales increase and Daniel generates more income, he will feel good and become a happy man. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":238980,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":["Conflict Zones"],"use":"buying a refrigerator and generator to chill his beverages","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SL","country":"Sierra Leone","town":"Magburaka, Tonkolili","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"8.5 -11.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":57,"posted_date":"2008-12-16T05:20:48Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Daniel ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-12-03T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"SLL","disbursal_amount":3000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":333333.33},{"due_date":"2009-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":333333.33},{"due_date":"2009-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":333333.33},{"due_date":"2009-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":333333.33},{"due_date":"2009-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":333333.33},{"due_date":"2009-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":333333.33},{"due_date":"2009-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":333333.33},{"due_date":"2009-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":333333.33},{"due_date":"2009-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":333333.36}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":111.11},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":111.11},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":111.11},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":111.11},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":111.12},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":111.11},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":111.11},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":111.11},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":111.11}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":86.67,"local_amount":260000,"processed_date":"2009-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-19T09:07:15Z","rounded_local_amount":260260,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14885068},{"amount":246.67,"local_amount":739999.99,"processed_date":"2009-03-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:44:10Z","rounded_local_amount":740739.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27128910},{"amount":111.11,"local_amount":333333.33,"processed_date":"2009-04-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:10:01Z","rounded_local_amount":333666.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36025699},{"amount":75.56,"local_amount":226666.68,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T23:54:27Z","rounded_local_amount":226893.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53008503},{"amount":257.77,"local_amount":773333.31,"processed_date":"2009-07-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:22:23Z","rounded_local_amount":774106.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63230845},{"amount":111.11,"local_amount":333333.33,"processed_date":"2009-08-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:37:22Z","rounded_local_amount":333666.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73662617},{"amount":111.11,"local_amount":333333.36,"processed_date":"2009-09-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T02:15:44Z","rounded_local_amount":333666.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87102852}],"funded_date":"2008-12-18T20:16:38Z","paid_date":"2009-10-16T02:15:44Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"JD Bergeron","image":1751016}},{"id":83658,"name":"Primo A.","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Primo trabaja de chofer asalariado de servicio publico, la esposa es comerciante de golosinas y masitas en la puerta de un colegio; tienen dos hijos de 10 y 6 a\u00f1os de edad, comparten una casa con su hermano.

For the past 20 years, she has succeeded in forging a good life and today, at the age of 54, she is still doing so. She lives in a rented house with her family, and what she wants most is to have a quiet old age. Florentina has a business selling sweets at a small school in the city of Juliaca. She sells candy, chocolate, cookies, etc. to all the children that congregate around her store during recess. She attends to them with much patience and care. What she enjoys most is seeing their happy faces when they buy their favorite confection. Florentina has been in this business for five years and is very happy doing it, though she suffers quite a bit every time it rains and she has to hurry to guard her things.

This is a very beautiful city with many touristic places, its churches and historic downtown, and its rivers, for which it is considered a Cultural World Heritage site. Its people are kind and educated.\r\n\r\nMrs. Maria Margarita O. I. is one of twelve members of the Communal Bank <em>Las Caleras<\/em>. These are very happy women, determined to get ahead with their families. She lives in Via al Tejar in the city of Cuenca, is 52 years old, and happily married. She has three children, 29, 28, and 22 years of age. The two eldest are married and live in their own homes, and the youngest daughter is a single mom and studies Tourism in the University of Cuenca. Her husband works as a taxi driver. Her house is the product of their work together as a couple.\r\n\r\nMaria works selling cosmetics and Yambal products door to door. She has had her business for four years and has a fixed clientele. She argues that she does well, through with a lot of sacrifice since she has to go around the city on foot to visit her customers from house to house.

Elsa keeps them healthy by feeding them fresh grass and alfalfa that she grows herself.  Every 15 days, she takes her animals to the local livestock fairs to sell.

Her husband works as a fisherman and they are blessed with 9 children with ages from 26 to 37 years old.\r\n<p>\r\nMinda knew the hardship her husband went through just to earn enough to sustain the needs of their family. Because of their situation, Minda pursued her plan to get into a business to help her husband even with just a small income.\r\n<p>\r\nWith a small amount of capital, she started a food vending business.  In 1995 she joined NWTF-Project Dungganon to have access to a bigger capital so she can expand her business by adding new kinds of food to sell. She would sell the food in the villages and towns near by. She would wake up early each morning to prepare the food to sell and prepare the food for her husband when he goes fishing. \r\n<p>\r\nShe was able to improve their way of living through NWTF-Project Dungganon because of her continuous loans. She earned Php 15,000 per month that was mostly used for her family and for her children.\r\n<p>\r\nMinda's previous loan of Php 9,500 was used as additional capital for her food vending business which was paid on-time without delay. Now, with the same amount of Php 9,500, she would like to purchase additional ingredients and equipment for her food vending business.\r\n<p>\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for  Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of  thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means \"honorable\"). Through the  alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress out of  earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even  their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make  them \"Dungganon\" -- a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of the community who has earned respect through a  lifetime of hard and honest work.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":445769,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

He now contracts people to help him work his own farm land where he plants bananas, coffee, star fruit, corn, yucca, and other native fruits.\r\n\r\nWhat he likes most about his work is cleaning the land because afterwards it produces a good harvest.  His future plans are to prepare some land that he does not use to increase his production and to participate in a government reforestation project.  That is why he will plant decorative plants and wood producing plants.\r\n\r\nThis is his fourth loan with MFP.  He and the other members of his communal bank, who are very responsible, are grateful for the loan.  They offer a new life with greater opportunities.  He plans to use the money he is now requesting to buy seven sacks of natural and chemical fertilizers.  He will also buy dozens of coffee plants, which he will plant on the farms that he recently bought.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":900,"image":{"id":493158,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Buy fertilizer and coffee plants","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Chanchamayo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.05 -75.316667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-02-22T15:50:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":900,"lender_count":26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ortizer","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-02-12T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-14T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":2500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":900}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":900,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:25:14Z","rounded_local_amount":2565.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172153837}],"funded_date":"2010-02-22T18:47:42Z","paid_date":"2010-10-15T10:25:14Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ginny Kalish"}},{"id":182790,"name":"Exaltacion","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Exaltacion Y. a is a 55-year old married woman who lives in Galicia Ilog, Negros Occidental.

They live in their own house, located in the rural area of Palcamayo. \r\n\r\nDespite some hardships, Rosa works hard to get ahead. She has been working in agriculture for 22 years. This business allows her to pay for her daughter Guisella\u2019s university studies. Every day, starting very early, she goes out to fields of spinach, potatoes, and vegetables. After harvesting them, she takes them to the wholesale market in the capital.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

district. Lyra is raising five daughters, two of whom are college students, in her close-knit family.  Her husband, Sultanmurat, is the mainstay in her life. In 2000, the couple decided to start a business breeding cattle, which was begun by buying a cow for 5,000 som (KGS). Through hard work and dedication, her farm now has ten head of sheep and one horse. Also, the family farms 1.5 hectares of irrigated land, where they have planted grasses and beans. In order to further development her business, Lira is asking for a loan in the amount of 50,000 Som (KGS) to increase the number of her livestock.\r\n\r\nBai-Tushum and Partners uses Kiva funding to target the especially vulnerable population.

its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Especially after working with Dinari Foundation, and assistance in animal business was done by a veterinarian. Since she already have a mother pig and 6 piglets, loan would be used to buy wheat shell clippings for several months pig's feed, and repairs of the stalls. Cleaning the stall and feeding are done 2X\/day, with objectives that mother pig and her 6 piglets are always healthy. Like always the case, Ni Ketut Suandi sells her 6 piglets for barbecue piglets at the age of 3 months. Feed expenses could reach Rp300,000 (about US$33). Total sales over 3 months could reach Rp1,000,000 (about $110), with a nett profit of Rp700,000 (about $77). This profit is useful to pay for family daily expense, and a teenage child.\r\n<p><b>Translated from Bahasa Indonesia by Gwan Liong Ang, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\nNyoman Suardana, suami dari Ni Ketut Suandi, sangat mendukung usaha ternak babi yang ditekuninya.

Karena sudah mempunyai Induk babi dan anaknya 6 ekor, dana bantuan dipergunakan untuk membeli dedak gandum untuk persediaan pakan babinya beberapa bulan dan untuk perbaikan kandangnya . Pembersihan kandang dan pemberian pakan dilakukan sehari dua kali dengan tujuan induk dan ke enam bibitnya selalu  sehat. Seperti biasa Ni Ketut Suandi menjual ke enam bibit babinya untuk babi guling yaitu pada umur tiga bulan. Pengeluaran untuk biaya pakan mencapai Rp. 300.000,-. Total penjualan yang didapat selama tiga bulan  mencapai Rp.1.000.000,- dengan kuntungan bersih Rp.700.000,-.Keuntungan ini sangat bermanfaat untuk mencukupi keperluan hidup sehari-hari dalam

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Nulu doesn\u2019t take care of any additional family members. There is electricity but no piped water at her home. The family gets three meals a day. She resides and works in a semi urban area which is in the outskirts of Kampala.\r\n\r\nNulu runs a hotel in Wankulukuku, one of the city suburbs. She sells meals to an average of 30 people a day, and works seven days a week. Nulu\u2019s major monthly expenses include rent for the business, electricity and medication. She doesn\u2019t incur extra transport cost to and from shopping as she buys from her place of work. She has been in this business for the last six years and sells to all categories of people. Her main challenges are increasing prices of meat and competition. Prior to this business Nulu sold sugar cane.\r\n\r\nNulu has been with MCDT (Micro Credit for Development and Transformation) for over five years and is requesting her twelfth loan, working all this time with the same group members. She wants to use this loan to pay rent for her business premises and also to buy more food for her restaurant.

Wilda requires a loan to help her cover various small debts during this period in which she must wait for her customers to pay her.\r\nWilda is very thankful for the opportunity to receive a loan that is offered to her by her communal bank, and she promises to complete all of her payments on time and in accordance with the payment schedule.  \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Kevin Lenhart, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":348851,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Capital para comprar y vender productos de belleza.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"CUSCO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.518333 -71.978056","type":"point"}},"partner_id":119,"posted_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:12Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":175,"lender_count":6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Wilda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-07-02T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":117.75},{"due_date":"2009-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":122.46},{"due_date":"2009-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":127.36},{"due_date":"2009-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":132.43}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.21},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.86},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.58},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.35}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":84.15,"local_amount":240.44,"processed_date":"2009-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T12:20:18Z","rounded_local_amount":255.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73564880},{"amount":44.62,"local_amount":127.48,"processed_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T13:09:12Z","rounded_local_amount":135.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":86998443},{"amount":46.23,"local_amount":132.08,"processed_date":"2009-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T14:46:34Z","rounded_local_amount":140.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96910695}],"funded_date":"2009-08-02T00:08:39Z","paid_date":"2009-11-15T14:46:34Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kevin Lenhart","image":null}},{"id":124634,"name":"Meng","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Meng P., age 30, works in the weaving business, typically making $3 US per day.

To make a living, she owns and operates a livestock business venture in the agriculture sector. The main source of income for the business comes from raising pigs for sale.

She has successfully repaid a previous loan from PMPC. Cecilia is requesting a new loan of 14,900 PHP, which will be used to purchase livestock feed and other supplies.

He mainly depends on the income from his farming to cater for the needs of his family.\r\n\r\nHe has requested this loan of 31,200 KES from Juhudi Kilimo to purchase and insure a dairy cow. He says that the extra income from this loan will help him take care of the basic needs of his family and also invest in other businesses. Fluctuations in the market prices of farm produce and diseases which are too costly to treat have been his biggest challenges. In the future, he plans to venture into zero grazing and improve his milk production.\r\n\r\nHe hopes that Juhudi will continue funding farmers in order to improve their standards of living.

By working hard in her fishing business, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of $200. \r\n\r\nArlene is borrowing 11,000 PHP so that she can purchase fishing gear and equipment.  This will be her 5th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of 10,000 PHP, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Arlene aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work. \r\n\r\nHelp NWTF continue its mission to help the poorest in the Philippines by clicking the link to the NWTF Kiva lending team on Kiva.org to join our team.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He is a head of household who works tirelessly to improve the standard of living of his family, always looking for opportunities to help himself and his family get ahead.  For these reasons, he currently works selling wood at wholesale.  It is hard work, and involves first buying the eucalyptus trees so that later he himself can cut them down into smaller pieces of wood.  His primary tools are an electric saw and an axe.  Once Felix has finished cutting, he selects what he is going to move and the amount that will fit into his truck for transport.  Felix has been in this business for five years, and this actity has allowed him to support the education of his four children.  He also plants and tends to several crops, including potatoes, on his land.  Felix makes great efforts to see his family get ahead each and every day, which is why he always seeks opportunities that may help him in this endeavor.  He seeks a loan to buy more trees so he can take advantage of the upcoming winter season when trees are scarce.  He hopes to, in this way, stabilize his earnings and have the ability to produce a greater quantity of product to offer for sale. <p>\r\n\r\n<p><b> Translated from Spanish by Mary Lynn, Kiva Volunteer. <\/b><p>\r\n\r\nF\u00e9lix tiene 39 a\u00f1os de edad y vive con  su esposa  y 4 hijos.

Her dream is to open up a restaurant in her house.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Shaun Haines, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":289829,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Purchase of ingredients for chicken soup to sell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":70,"posted_date":"2009-03-21T02:10:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Teodora","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-03-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1200,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2009-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2009-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2009-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2009-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2009-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":200}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":66.66,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2009-04-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T16:05:09Z","rounded_local_amount":212.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35982713},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2009-05-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T22:52:01Z","rounded_local_amount":212.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44443231},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2009-06-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T20:24:32Z","rounded_local_amount":212.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52953527},{"amount":66.68,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2009-07-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T13:29:34Z","rounded_local_amount":212.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63170758},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2009-08-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T14:52:38Z","rounded_local_amount":212.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73596253},{"amount":66.65,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2009-09-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T16:45:55Z","rounded_local_amount":212.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87031815}],"funded_date":"2009-03-21T02:20:35Z","paid_date":"2009-10-15T16:45:55Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Shaun Haines","image":55908}},{"id":100074,"name":"Oiposho","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"<p>Working in agriculture has helped Oiposho P. and her family to overcome the tremendous loss of her husband. Twelve years ago she was forced to learn how to take on the responsibility of obtaining an education for two children alone, something that was not an easy task. Thanks to her organizational skills and care she has been able to maintain stability in her home. Oiposho\u2019s great knowledge regarding her profession has allowed her to produce good quality and variety, but it has still not been enough. That is why she would like to make a greater investment in her land so that she can increase her income. She would like to earn enough to contribute to the costs of her children\u2019s education.<\/p> \r\n\r\n<p>Oiposho is requesting a loan of 2200 Somoni in order to purchase high quality seeds and fertilizer for her land. She appeals to the generous hearts of those who can grant her this assistance.<\/p> \r\n\r\n<p>More about Tajikistan and IMON International<\/p>\r\n<p>Tajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and with it\u2019s famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.<\/p>\r\n \r\n<p>But, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.<\/p> \r\n\r\n<p>IMON's History<\/p>\r\n<p>Since December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

With the help of her past 6 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Marilou has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 7000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 2500 per month,  uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 7th loan, she is borrowing PHP 9000, which she intends to use as additional working capital for her food vending business so that she could continue to save up for future education of her children.

While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are both responsible for paying back the loan of their fellow group member if she is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is Y\u00ean H\u1eadu 2 nh\u00f3m 12 (Nh\u00f3m 12).\r\n\r\nL. is married and has four adult children. To making a living, she raises cattle for sale.

She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5.152.000 VND from SEDA which was used to purchase baby livestock to raise and sell. She is now requesting a new loan of 6.496.000 VND which will be used to purchase livestock feed and other supplies. The loan will be the second taken out by the borrower from SEDA.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, Western culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. A civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 percent of the country is mountainous and only seven percent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients have viable business propositions. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

This water is easily contaminated with bacteria that can cause diarrhea and other water-borne diseases, meaning that Fabian and his family may fall sick and become unable to work or attend school.\n\nFabian works as a peasant farmer, but has also volunteered his time to be the promoter for a new chlorine dispenser program that enables his community to drink safe water and stay healthy. Fabian and three other promoters in his community, including Benter, Pamela and Rose, need a loan to cover the costs of installing and maintaining chlorine dispensers at the water sources in the area. Fabian will encourage the community to treat their water with the dispenser and refill the dispenser with chlorine as needed. Fabian wants to be a promoter because he believes that the dispenser system will prevent water-borne diseases.\n\nThe Kiva loan will be repaid by Evidence Action (www.evidenceaction.org) on behalf of the community, through the sale of carbon credits. Using the chlorine dispenser generates carbon credits by avoiding the need to boil water to make it safe to drink. Revenues from the sale of carbon credits to organizations and individuals wanting to reduce world carbon footprint will be used to repay Kiva lenders and also to make sure that Fabian\u2019s community can have access to safe water now and in the future.\n"}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1804183,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Health","sector":"Health","themes":["Innovative Loans","Water and Sanitation"],"use":"To reduce the burden of water-borne diseases by providing access to safe drinking water via chlorine dispensers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"NDHIWA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":324,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1800,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Fabian ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Benter ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Pamela ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rose ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-01-17T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1800,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":72,"loan_amount":1800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2018-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":450},{"due_date":"2019-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":450},{"due_date":"2020-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":600}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2019-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":450},{"due_date":"2020-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":450},{"due_date":"2021-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":600}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":1762,"name":"Klouyibo Ayawavi","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. A.

With the revenue from her small business she significantly contributes to meeting the needs of her home for the income of her husband is insufficient and too irregular to meet the needs of the family. As a skilful salesperson, she often calls on prospects to present new cloth ranges. The strategy works very well as evidenced by the growth of the activity over the past two years; however she lacks financial resources to meet the demand from her customers. As at now, the demand remains high thanks to the approaching end of year festive period. She therefore requested a new credit to meet the needs of her clients. \r\n\r\nThe amount requested is $850. It will allow her to build up a sufficient stock of loincloth for the end of year festive period. Mrs. A. Klouyibo Ayawavi has enough experience and talent to successfully run this activity. \r\n\r\n<p> \r\n\r\nMadame A. Klouyibo Ayawavi est n\u00e9e le 28 D\u00e9cembre 1972 \u00e0 Sotouboua. Mari\u00e9e et m\u00e8re de trois (03) enfants, elle prend en charge 3 autres enfants de proches parents. Analphab\u00e8te mais tr\u00e8s ing\u00e9nieuse, elle s\u2019est lanc\u00e9e tr\u00e8s t\u00f4t dans le commerce de pagne et d\u2019assiette. Avec les revenus de son petit commerce de pagne, elle contribue \u00e9norm\u00e9ment au besoin du m\u00e9nage car le revenu est non seulement tr\u00e8s insuffisant mais irr\u00e9gulier pour couvrir les charges du foyer. Tr\u00e8s commerciale, elle va souvent vers sa client\u00e8le pour lui proposer les nouvelles gammes de pagnes. Cette derni\u00e8re strat\u00e9gie fonctionne bien car l\u2019activit\u00e9 a pris de l\u2019ampleur ces 2 derni\u00e8res ann\u00e9es, mais les moyens financiers lui font d\u00e9faut pour r\u00e9pondre aux demandes de sa client\u00e8le. Actuellement, la demande est encore tr\u00e8s forte car les f\u00eates de fin d\u2019ann\u00e9e s\u2019approchent. Ce qui  l\u2019am\u00e8ne \u00e0 solliciter un nouveau cr\u00e9dit pour satisfaire sa client\u00e8le.\r\n\r\nLe montant de $850 sollicit\u00e9 servira \u00e0 constituer un stock suffisant de pagnes pour les f\u00eates de fin d\u2019ann\u00e9e. Madame A. Klouyibo Ayawavi dispose de beaucoup d\u2019exp\u00e9rience et de talent pour mener \u00e0 bien cette activit\u00e9.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":850,"image":{"id":4371,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"To buy loincloth","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TG","country":"Togo","town":"Tabligbo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"6.583333 1.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":22,"posted_date":"2006-11-14T17:34:59Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":850,"lender_count":32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Klouyibo Ayawavi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2006-11-29T08:18:29Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":850,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2006-12-29T08:00:00Z","amount":121.43},{"due_date":"2007-01-29T08:00:00Z","amount":121.43},{"due_date":"2007-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":121.43},{"due_date":"2007-03-29T07:00:00Z","amount":121.43},{"due_date":"2007-04-29T07:00:00Z","amount":121.43},{"due_date":"2007-05-29T07:00:00Z","amount":121.43},{"due_date":"2007-06-29T07:00:00Z","amount":121.42}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":121.43},{"due_date":"2007-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":121.43},{"due_date":"2007-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":121.43},{"due_date":"2007-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":121.43},{"due_date":"2007-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":121.43},{"due_date":"2007-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":121.43},{"due_date":"2007-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":121.42}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":122,"local_amount":122,"processed_date":"2006-12-28T09:32:38Z","settlement_date":"2007-06-18T19:48:46Z","rounded_local_amount":122,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":3722},{"amount":122,"local_amount":122,"processed_date":"2007-01-31T06:04:16Z","settlement_date":"2007-06-18T19:48:46Z","rounded_local_amount":122,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5752},{"amount":122,"local_amount":122,"processed_date":"2007-01-31T06:04:54Z","settlement_date":"2007-06-18T19:48:46Z","rounded_local_amount":122,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5760},{"amount":122,"local_amount":122,"processed_date":"2007-03-15T10:30:57Z","settlement_date":"2007-06-18T19:48:46Z","rounded_local_amount":122,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":10213},{"amount":244,"local_amount":244,"processed_date":"2007-05-15T09:15:25Z","settlement_date":"2007-06-18T19:48:46Z","rounded_local_amount":244,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":16405},{"amount":118,"local_amount":118,"processed_date":"2007-06-15T09:16:04Z","settlement_date":"2007-06-18T19:48:46Z","rounded_local_amount":118,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":23207}],"funded_date":"2006-11-15T08:18:29Z","paid_date":"2007-06-15T09:16:04Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":5858,"name":"Mariama","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mariama is 37 years old and married with 4 children.

She is married and has 12 adult  children.  To make a living, Selina owns and operates a business venture in the food sector making and selling food.  While not the only means of generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling ice cream in the local community.  Selina has been engaged in this business for over 1 year and earns approximately 300 WST a month from these activities.\n\nSelina joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Selina is requesting a new loan of 1000 WST which will be used to purchase raw ingredients needed to make products for sale.  The loan will be the first loan taken out by Selina from SPBD.  Selina plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family.\n\nAbout SPBD:\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.\n\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they all are responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is C\u1ea7u Gi\u1eefa 1 - Nh\u00f3m 03 (3).\r\n\r\nK\u1ef7 is married and has two school-aged children. To make a living, K\u1ef7 operates a store, selling animal feed and farm-related products in the local community. K\u1ef7 has been engaged in this business for over 10 years and earns approximately 5.000.000 Vietnamese Dong a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, K\u1ef7 joined SEDA to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and ability to engage in business activities. K\u1ef7 has successfully repaid a previous loan of 4.704.000 VND from SEDA. This previous loan was used to invest in expanding the business. He is now requesting a new loan of 7.392.000 VND, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This will be the third loan taken out by the borrower from SEDA. K\u1ef7 plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of his family.\r\n\r\nAbout the other borrowers in the group:\r\n\r\n1.

She owns a business venture, selling a variety of different products in the local community.  Maria  has many years of experience in this business.  Maria  needs a loan of WST $1500 to purchase additional products to sell.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 750 talas or US $313 per week) to financially support immediate members of her family.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Maria  joined SPBD.    This is her 2nd loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Maria 's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Maria Y. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.6 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.7 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2.3 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

She will also purchase feed for her pigs. This will be the eighth loan taken out by Amalia from CEVI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay the tuition fees her children and supplement her family's income. \r\n\r\nAbout CEVI:\r\n\r\nCommunity Economic Ventures, Inc (CEVI) has increased its portfolio significantly over the recent years. Based in Bohol, they have numerous branches throughout the Philippines.  In 2009, CEVI was awarded a CGAP silver award for transparency in social performance monitoring. CEVI not only provides credit for its clients but additionally savings, insurance, and training which are provided through regular cluster group meetings.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":545402,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To purchase fertilizers, seeds and other farm inputs.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Banga, South Cotabato","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"6.423889 124.778333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":125,"posted_date":"2010-05-25T17:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Amalia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-05-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":15000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":15000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":325}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":325,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T13:27:50Z","rounded_local_amount":15150,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177385736}],"funded_date":"2010-05-25T19:06:05Z","paid_date":"2010-11-15T13:27:50Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tammea Arthur","image":1739710}},{"id":207464,"name":"Judith F.","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Judith F.

Jereza is borrowing PHP 15,000 so that she can purchase raw materials. This will be her sixth loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 13,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Jereza aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future wellbeing by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

She is 30 years old and never attended school, though at an early age, she was placed with a tutor in Cotonou and helped her with selling various goods:  fresh eggs and pagnes (colorful West African cloth).  After a few years, she left her tutor for her mother in the countryside and remained there until her marriage to Mr. Celestin AZOGA.  Today she is the mother of three children, one of whom is in school.  With financial help from her husband and mother-in-law, she got started on her own selling:  charcoal, condiments, vegetable oil, red palm oil, and gasoline.
