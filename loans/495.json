It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is 29 years old and is the mother of two daughters who are of 2 years and 1 year old respectively. She lives in a three-room brick house with her husband and family that they moved into three years ago.\r\n\r\nRiffat is a seamstress and does sewing work for her neighborhood customers. She is very good at her art and has a good reputation among her customers for her good work.\r\n\r\nRiffat\u2019s husband has a business selling ready-made garments. He operates a shop in the market and sells clothes for gents and children. His business is going very well but he needs further improvement to it because new designs are introduced rapidly in the fashion industry and to keep his shop up-to-date he needs to offer new garment collections, otherwise the other clothes sellers will take the advantage of this which would effect his sales.\r\n\r\nTherefore, Riffat has applied for a loan from Asasah to help her husband improve his business.

D., 30, a resident of Silang, Cavite City, Philippines. She is married to Nepumoceno Sto. D., a driver. She is also the mother of two children: one in high school and one in elementary school. By the grace of God, Marisa has managed to support her children's schooling. At this time, she is working hard to be able to send both of her children all the way through college. This is a dream for most Filipino parents like Marisa, as she herself has been a college undergraduate and believes that a college diploma is the best inheritance parents can give to their children.\r\n\r\nMarisa operates a variety store; she also oversees operations of their tricycle and maintains their piggery. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which sells groceries, toiletries, and beverages to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a small amount of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns her income by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling them at retail prices by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 300 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operating her business, she is requesting a PHP 18,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy more quantities of products like groceries, toiletries, and beverages in order to expand her product inventory. She expects an increase in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n \r\nMarisa dreams to be able to give all her children a high quality education through all her hard work in her business. She also hopes to have her house renovated by the end of the year. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay micro finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":594293,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To purchase products for variety store","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Silang, Cavite","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2010-09-04T13:00:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marisa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-08-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":18000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2010-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2010-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2010-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2010-09-29T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2010-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2010-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2010-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2010-10-27T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2010-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2010-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2010-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2010-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2010-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2010-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2010-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2010-12-29T08:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2011-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2011-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2011-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2011-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2011-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2011-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":750}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":3750,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T09:53:06Z","rounded_local_amount":3750.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172089056},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T13:21:02Z","rounded_local_amount":3000.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177380420},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-16T11:02:51Z","rounded_local_amount":3000.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182816757},{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":3750,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T12:42:50Z","rounded_local_amount":3750.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188652708},{"amount":100,"local_amount":4500,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T02:29:00Z","rounded_local_amount":4500.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191395889}],"funded_date":"2010-09-15T17:24:52Z","paid_date":"2011-02-16T02:29:00Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"JoEllen Wilkins","image":null}},{"id":232450,"name":"Elena","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Elena A. is from the village of Bacnor West.

Peregrina learned how to farm as a young child but her work now involves mostly small livestock. She raises sheep and guinea pigs, which she finds to be a profitable business. It provides her with income in the time before she can harvest her maize crop. Growing maize requires time and a lot of work from Peregrina and her family. Also, some seasons are affected by bad weather and other factors that can result in the loss of all her investments of time and money. Nevertheless, these challenges don't discourage Peregrina because farming is her way of life. \r\n\r\nFor now, Peregrina's greatest hope is to improve her maize harvest and expand her livestock business.

She started it on her own since she had to get her children ahead and she is a single mother. So with the help of her children, she would go out selling. Since one of them was little, and needed care, sometimes she would go out to sell with her son. The loan that she is requesting is for working capital to purchase creams, perfumes and lotions. Her wish is to suceed with her business.\r\n\r\nThe last member is Mar\u00eda Elena O. R. who is 46 years old. She has two children in her care. Her job is selling cosmetics and sweets.

It served as a key post along the Silk Road and marked the end of Alexander the Great's extensive rule. It was the birthplace of the great Persian poet Rudaki and famous Islamic philosopher Ibn Sina. And it is home to epic mountain passes, communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>IMON\u2019s History<\/b><br>\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition.

She is starting a business venture, planting & harvesting taro to sell.  Sikola needs a loan of WST$1000 to purchase harvesting equipment such as wheelbarrows, shovels, rakes, baskets, and knives.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 450 talas or US $188 per week) to improve and expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Sikola joined SPBD.  This is her 1st loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Sikola's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.

In 2000, she established her furniture-making business.  She works 7 days a week and 8 hours a day to support her family.  She has already received and successfully repaid 2 loans from Patan BPW and used her most recent to purchase wood and timber for her work.  In the future, Sanu Maiya plans to improve the economic condition of her family.  She thanks you for your support.\r\n\r\nIn Nepal, furniture is still made the old-fashioned way.  Using little more than basic hand tools, skilled artisans form raw lumber into beautifully finished pieces of furniture.  With precision and an eye for detail, furniture makers produce shelves, bed frames, and cabinet sets.  With the help of a Kiva loan, a furniture maker is able to increase the volume of lumber purchases or hire additional labor.  This additional leverage allows an entrepreneur to increase productivity and profitability. \r\n\r\nThis loan was administered by Kiva's local partner MFI, Patan Business and Professional Women. Patan BPW became Kiva's first field partner in Nepal in 2007.  Patan BPW operates throughout the Kathmandu Valley, offering microcredit and business training programs to low-income women.  In addition to providing economic opportunity to its clients, Patan BPW seeks to empower Nepali women within the home and community.

Her previous loan of PHP 29,500 helped her increase her monthly income to PHP 36,000, improving the family's standard of living. This time, for her twelfth loan, she is borrowing PHP 49,500, which she intends to use to purchase more material to sew. Her goal is to continue to save and buy land for her family.

44, who hails from Clarin, Misamis Occidental is married to Lauro N., who is a typical farmer.  During the first year of their marriage, Melinda had a miscarriage which left her unable to have children anymore. She then just contented herself looking after the house and help her husband in his farming chores.To while away her time she decided to join PMPC and got deeply involved in its community activities. She was even able to organize a group of women in her village to develop their entrepreneurial capacities. \n\nAfter undergoing a series of training conducted by PMPC on how to become an entrepreneur and manage household finances, she then renovated the frontage of her house and converted it into a small retail shop. She was able to do this using a start-up loan of PHP 2,000 from PMPC. Her little business gradually grew and after two years she was able to increase her working capital to PHP 20,000. She is now able to earn an income of her own and not depend so much on the meager income from the farm of her husband. While the couple is childless, Melinda has focused her attention on leading the group of women entrepreneurs she organized in her village and help them succeed in their ventures.\n\nRecords of PMPC would show that for 15 loan cycles, Melinda has no record of default, and she was able to maintain her Member In Good Standing status. Her husband also helps her business when he is not on the farm.  \n\nHer knowledge about how to handle customers properly helped her gain additional regular clients and increase the demand for her goods. Now she is applying for a loan worth PHP 20,000 for the purchase of additional stocks to further expand her retail shop.\n\nThe couple\u2019s future plan is to increase their business assets so that they can build a concrete sari-sari store to protect their stocks. They also have plans to renovate their house, as it is only made of light materials.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":229911,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Purchase

Energetic and devoted, Mrs. T. has no more financial means to satisfy her clientele. She seeks a loan to buy more shrimp, crab, and fish.

For the future, Luisa desires to finish fixing the infrastructure of her house and to buy showcases where she can exhibit her products.  She is sure that this business is the activity that she wants to continue pursuing.  \r\n\r\nThis is her fifteenth credit with MFP and she promises to continue being prompt in her payments.  She feels very comfortable in her communal bank, since they have supported her a lot in the circumstances that life has given her, for which she is very thankful to her companions.  The money that she now requests will be invested in adding to her beauty products, so that she can continue working in the manner she likes.  \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Barbara (B) Brown, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":485557,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To buy more beauty products for resale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-02-09T16:30:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":525,"lender_count":4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Luisa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-01-13T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":221.29},{"due_date":"2010-03-13T08:00:00Z","amount":237.45},{"due_date":"2010-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":242.64},{"due_date":"2010-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":255.14},{"due_date":"2010-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":264.96},{"due_date":"2010-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":278.52}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.45},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.11},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.92},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.3},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92.74},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.48}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":77.45,"local_amount":221.29,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:49:27Z","rounded_local_amount":222.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123960347},{"amount":83.11,"local_amount":237.45,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:33:21Z","rounded_local_amount":238.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128993202},{"amount":84.92,"local_amount":242.64,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:38:26Z","rounded_local_amount":243.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136717984},{"amount":89.3,"local_amount":255.14,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:39:57Z","rounded_local_amount":256.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144751661},{"amount":92.74,"local_amount":264.96,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:02:52Z","rounded_local_amount":266.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151934126},{"amount":97.48,"local_amount":278.52,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:37:06Z","rounded_local_amount":279.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159672900}],"funded_date":"2010-02-09T16:50:27Z","paid_date":"2010-08-15T11:37:06Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"B Brown","image":120650}},{"id":178964,"name":"Siam","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Siam V., age 39, is married and resides with her husband in Takeo Province, Cambodia.

Her husband drives a school bus.\r\n\r\nWhen she was 17, she learned how to cut and make clothing at the \u201cAcademia Luis Alfredo Carvajal\u201d in Portoviejo.  She began making clothing and now has her own small tailor shop in her home, where she works daily from 8:00 AM to 10:30 AM and then from 2:00 PM to 8:00 PM.  In her spare time she helps her children with their homework.  She makes all types of clothing, but what she enjoys making the most is sport and casual clothing.  Her sister helps her because she gets too many orders to do herself.\r\n\r\nShe will use the money from this loan to buy fabric and other materials.  She has been with her communal bank for six years and she likes the ease of repayment terms from the institution.  Her dream is to have a large shop in the city center.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":612589,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Tailoring","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"Supplies","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Portoviejo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2010-10-08T21:20:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":675,"lender_count":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nuvia Estibilita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-09-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":660,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2010-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2010-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2010-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2010-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2011-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2011-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2011-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2011-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2011-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2011-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":55}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":56.25,"local_amount":55,"processed_date":"2010-10-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T13:58:31Z","rounded_local_amount":56.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177407613},{"amount":56.25,"local_amount":55,"processed_date":"2010-11-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-21T10:29:43Z","rounded_local_amount":56.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":183388799},{"amount":56.25,"local_amount":55,"processed_date":"2010-11-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-21T10:30:27Z","rounded_local_amount":56.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":183388800},{"amount":56.25,"local_amount":55,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-21T10:31:42Z","rounded_local_amount":56.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":183388801},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":110,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T13:10:27Z","rounded_local_amount":112.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188683016},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":110,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T03:32:46Z","rounded_local_amount":112.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191422140},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":110,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:41:09Z","rounded_local_amount":112.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195840922},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":110,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:03:11Z","rounded_local_amount":112.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201283391}],"funded_date":"2010-10-09T18:47:18Z","paid_date":"2011-04-15T11:03:11Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Hugo E.

They have a beautiful daughter, Angelis, who is one year old. They live as a family in their own home, located in the Uni\u00f3n Palomar community (central Peruvian rainforest).   \r\n\r\nEight years ago, Chriss took on the commitment to do the arduous work of planting, fertilizing, and harvesting. She says that she has liked the country and the production of the land since she was a little girl. \r\n\r\nNow she has more than 2 hectacres of agricultural land, where she plants plantains on a large scale and harvests them twice a month. What Chriss likes best is being able to sell her delicious plantains through intermediaries, who willingly advise her on new markets where she can expand her sales and offer her fruits.  \r\n\r\nIn the future she wants to become a wholesale vendor and be able to travel around the whole country offering fruits native to the rainforest. \r\n\r\nThis is her first loan with MFP, and she hopes to get ahead in life together with her communal bank that is made up of people who are committed to progress. With the requested loan, she plans to purchase 3 bags of organic fertilizer, which she will apply to beds of coffee that she recently planted. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":677493,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To purchase 3 bags of organic fertilizer","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Chanchamayo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.05 -75.316667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-12-27T06:20:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Chriss","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-12-13T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":375}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":375,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T09:14:05Z","rounded_local_amount":1050.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221718368}],"funded_date":"2010-12-27T12:00:29Z","paid_date":"2011-08-15T09:14:05Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":265267,"name":"Mariana Del Rocio","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La Se\u00f1ora.

They live in traditional families.  They are 29 years old on average and have at least 7 children.  They raise peanuts and soy.  With the intention of making their agricultural concerns profitable, the group members decided to join the Soro Yiriwaso credit program four years ago.  After having fully repaid their previous loans, they are on their fourth country loan.  Sitan, the first seated with her hand on the small bucket, expects to use her loan to buy a sufficient quantity of peanut and soy seeds, some light equipment, and agricultural fertilizers at the big market in Kimparana.  After the rainy season, the harvests are stored for a certain amount of time so that they gain value before being sold at the big markets in Kimparana and San and at surrounding markets at retail (or often wholesale) for cash to a customer base generally coming from the big cities.  The members of the group Benkadi I expect to each make a profit of 39,000 to 42,500 FCFA after the harvest of their agricultural products, which will be used to pay the interest on their loans and their families' current expenses."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1300,"image":{"id":789484,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"to purchase fertilizers, seeds, and light equipment.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Nikankan","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1300,"lender_count":46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sitan ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Saly ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Korotoumou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Aissa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Safiatou Lassina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatoumata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Awa Alou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fanta ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatoumata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sitan S ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-05-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":585000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":1300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":585000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1300}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":1300,"local_amount":585000,"processed_date":"2012-02-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-16T08:45:47Z","rounded_local_amount":586891.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263424519}],"funded_date":"2011-07-04T23:47:44Z","paid_date":"2012-04-16T08:45:47Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Martha Schmitz","image":489893}},{"id":310345,"name":"Yajaira Cristina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Yajaira is 31 years old and lives in the city of Ibarra, in northern Ecuador.

She is married and has three children in preschool and elementary.  Since Lety is well known in her town she is requesting a loan to invest in her fruit and vegetable business to sell seasonal fruit such as avocado, nostle fruit, potatoes, spinach, guava, oranges, etc.  She has been in business for approximately three years.  She starts her day at 4:00 a.m. when she goes to the produce market in a nearby town.  There she buys fresh fruit at a good price.  One of the difficulties she has is when sales are slow and the produce goes bad.  Lety says the loan will be beneficial because she will be able to stock fruit and with the earnings contribute more to the household expenses which will improve her children's lifestyle.  One of Leticia's goals is to have her own stall at the market, since now she is a street vendor.  She also sells fruits and vegetables out of her home where she would like to set up a stand instead of using her kitchen as a salespoint.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":885249,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits &

woman named Meriam A. lives. She is 46 years old and married to Juanito, a devoted and brave fisherman. The couple was blessed with two children and both of them have settled down.\r\n\r\nMr. Juanito once worked with their neighbor who had a fishing boat. He had a small share of the fishing income, but it was not enough for the whole family. Meriam happened to become a Paglaum Co-op member when one of their neighbors (a co-op member too) sold the couple Paglaum\u2019s programs and services five years ago. The couple was so thankful for Paglaum because they were granted enough money to purchase machinery for their own fishing boat. From then on, Meriam's husband no longer worked with their neighbor, but focused on his own fishing boat and has reaped their income from it. While her husband is focusing on fishing, Mrs. A. is also vending snacks, ice candy, ice, and bar-b-que in their neighborhood to provide additional income for the family. Bar- b-que is a kind of thinly sliced pork or any meat attached to a bamboo stick and grilled. It has a minimal selling price of only two to five pesos and is very affordable to the market.  \r\n\r\nCurrently, the couple has acquired three unit motorized pump boats and is applying for a loan worth fifteen thousand pesos (P15,000.00) for the acquisition of another fishing boat which is bigger and better than what they have now.  According to them, the bigger the boat is, the more it can fight big waves, can run through even during stormy season, and can transport and hold a number of huge fish caught at sea. An average of fifty kilos per day is their daily sales from one unit motorized pump boat, with an average of forty pesos (P40) selling price per kilo, depending on the type and variety of fish. \r\n\r\nThe couple was so grateful for Paglaum MPC because through the co-op they were able to build a partially concrete house. The couple hopes for more blessings to come as they faithfully maintain their Member In Good Standing status with the co-op and pay their loans on time with no trace of default. The family is dreaming of having a \u201clantsa\u201d, a much bigger fishing boat with at least 20 workers so that they can fish from coast to coast in the

This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. \r\n\r\n<P>One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that it allows clients to use

Despite the fact that her work is full of sacrifice, she assures us that thanks to agriculture she can cover expenses for her home, such as furnishing it, to have a better quality of life for her family.

Thi Luu's family only focused on farming and small retail activities, thus, her family was very poor as she and her husband had just started to live separately from their parents. In 1995, she joined the Fund and borrowed 500.000VND (about 32USD) to invest in buying and selling general goods. She realised that it was easy to repay the loan weekly and that she had more capital for her business. Therefore, she used the subsequent loans to move into butchering. Her husband selected and butchered the pigs while Mrs. Luu sold the pork at the wet market. She also catered for offices and restaurants, so her annual income reached hundreds of millions VND. In 2005, she used the profits from the butcher shop and borrowed more money to build a spacious 2-storey house. Currently, she is still concentrating on the butcher shop and caters for the restaurant in Noi Bai airport. Her family's monthly income is about 8,000,000VND (about 515USD). This time, she would like to borrow 19,000,000VND (1,150.00USD) to invest in her butcher shop.\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Vietnamese by Pham Yen Thanh, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\nTr\u01b0\u1edbc khi tham gia Q\u0169y T\u00ecnh Th\u01b0\u01a1ng gia \u0111\u00ecnh ch\u1ecb ch\u1ec9 l\u00e0m n\u00f4ng nghi\u1ec7p v\u00e0 bu\u00f4n b\u00e1n nh\u1ecf l\u1ebb, khi \u0111\u00f3 kinh t\u1ebf gia \u0111\u00ecnh r\u1ea5t kh\u00f3 kh\u0103n v\u00ec hai v\u1ee3 ch\u1ed3ng m\u1edbi \u0111\u01b0\u1ee3c b\u1ed1 m\u1eb9 cho ra \u1edf ri\u00eang.

Her business is toy sales, adjusting the items she carries according to the time of year and special national holidays. The stand she occupies is rented space. It is located in the market, the most visited market in the district. All her sales are finalized in cash only. She pays special attention to cordiality and customer service, which is why her sales are always so good. She has been at this business for the past 6 years and she loves doing what she does.  She is able to employ her daughter as help to carry out sales. Her greatest dream is to finish building a stand in a different market so that they can move their business.

Mamerta S., age 61, still has something to live for even without her husband at her side any more. Maita, as she is called by fellow community partners in CCT*, reached high school level during her educational years; at present, she devotes her time to running her own small business. She has her seven children to continue living for. Maita\u2019s family resides in Pasay City, Metro Manila.\r\n\r\nA sari-sari (variety) store serves as Maita\u2019s main source of income. With it, she strives to meet the immediate needs of her community as she makes every effort to earn income for her family. The store is residential and is thus accessible to the family. Maita has been running a sari-sari store for 25 years now; she did so even when her husband Valentin, also a vendor, was still living. Monthly, Maita earns Php 12,000 on average.\r\n\r\nTo help her grow her business, Maita loans Php 10,000. She will make good use of the loan by purchasing products that are in demand in their location, such as the vinegar and coal used by some families to prepare their meals. Maita says the loan also enables her to give to family members when an emergency arises. \r\n\r\nThe challenge Maita has to face is the selling of products that are not much in demand, such as canned goods. People in her community are not much into buying these goods, as they prefer cooking their own meals. But one good thing is that Maita can focus on making her business efficient, as she currently has no significant personal problems. She desires to make her business more profitable in order to be able to help others. She hopes that her sari-sari store will grow into a grocery, so that she will be able to renovate her commercial space as well as their house. Most of all, she prays that her children will become successful and have their own growing businesses.\r\n\r\nAs a CCT community partner, she faithfully attends the group's weekly fellowship meeting where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she received.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":721311,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To purchase such items as coal and vinegar for retail sale in her shop","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Pasay City","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2011-02-26T17:20:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":250,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mamerta ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-02-10T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":666.62}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":50,"local_amount":2000.01,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:29:07Z","rounded_local_amount":2193.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195814282},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":2666.68,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T10:37:47Z","rounded_local_amount":2924.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201256854},{"amount":66.66,"local_amount":2666.68,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T10:33:50Z","rounded_local_amount":2924.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206123547},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":2666.63,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T10:49:33Z","rounded_local_amount":2924.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211194874}],"funded_date":"2011-02-26T17:34:23Z","paid_date":"2011-06-15T10:49:33Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Maeve","image":1271729}},{"id":281689,"name":"Ana Maria","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"\nLa socia pertenece al banco comunal \u201cAMAUTA\u201d; Este banco est\u00e1 ubicado en el distrito de Urubamba, provincia de Urubamba, departamento de Cusco.\n\nLa socia es la Sra: Ana; La socia tiene 51 a\u00f1os de edad, es casada, y tiene 2 hijos, (20,17); la socia es comerciante minorista, la socia vende productos de belleza por cat\u00e1logos, ella tiene un peque\u00f1o almac\u00e9n en casa en el cual ella almacena los productos de belleza que la socia compra en oferta para despu\u00e9s de un tiempo poderlos ofrecer a un poco mas y como deja en dos partes el producto, las clientes que tiene le compran; la socia tambi\u00e9n viaja y trae ropa de la cuidad de Lima, ella vende todo tipo de ropa; La socia requiere el cr\u00e9dito para comprar ropa y productos de belleza para la venta.

She started in the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo more than 15 years ago and has received 22 loans. Her first activity was realted to a small business selling merchandise via catalogues, or specialized product guides. Then, inspired by her parents activities, also a part of the Foundation's programs, she added the activity of selling beverages such as beer from a small cooler. She still has the cooler and has added making frozen food. These activities continue generating her income and she dreams of making them grow more every day to continue improving her quality of life. At present, her small freezer is not in the best condition and she needs to replace it soon. That is why she is turning to Kiva loans to buy a new cooler to go from small scale beer selling to providing a larger quantity for stores and other establishments. Her dream is to buy her own house, because at present she lives in her parent's house. They have always supported her in all of the things she has done in life.

She believes that these center meetings instill strength and provide different ideas of things she can do with her own hands and from her own home to earn money to help support her family."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":900,"image":{"id":19199,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Patchwork","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"Purchase 10 kava bowls.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"WS","country":"Samoa","town":"Apia Park","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.583333 -172.333333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":15,"posted_date":"2007-03-29T01:14:47Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":900,"lender_count":26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Faavevela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-04-18T21:52:35Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":900,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2007-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2007-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2007-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2007-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2007-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2007-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2007-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2008-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2008-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2008-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2008-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":75}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2007-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2007-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2008-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":75,"local_amount":75,"processed_date":"2007-06-05T22:02:37Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-19T09:27:57Z","rounded_local_amount":75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20476},{"amount":150,"local_amount":150,"processed_date":"2007-07-19T09:15:21Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-19T09:27:57Z","rounded_local_amount":150,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":33495},{"amount":75,"local_amount":75,"processed_date":"2007-08-19T09:15:24Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-19T09:27:57Z","rounded_local_amount":75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44238},{"amount":75,"local_amount":75,"processed_date":"2007-09-19T09:15:33Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-19T09:27:57Z","rounded_local_amount":75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":56250},{"amount":75,"local_amount":75,"processed_date":"2007-10-19T09:15:43Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-19T09:27:57Z","rounded_local_amount":75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":69243},{"amount":75,"local_amount":75,"processed_date":"2007-11-19T10:16:06Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-19T09:27:57Z","rounded_local_amount":75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":83415},{"amount":75,"local_amount":75,"processed_date":"2007-12-19T10:16:08Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-19T09:27:57Z","rounded_local_amount":75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":99156},{"amount":75,"local_amount":75,"processed_date":"2008-01-19T10:15:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-19T09:27:57Z","rounded_local_amount":75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":117889},{"amount":75,"local_amount":75,"processed_date":"2008-02-19T10:15:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-19T09:27:57Z","rounded_local_amount":75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":137990},{"amount":75,"local_amount":75,"processed_date":"2008-03-19T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-19T09:27:57Z","rounded_local_amount":75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":160986},{"amount":75,"local_amount":75,"processed_date":"2008-04-19T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-19T09:27:57Z","rounded_local_amount":75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":186062}],"funded_date":"2007-04-04T21:52:35Z","paid_date":"2008-04-19T09:03:35Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":10438,"name":"Rosa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rosa has a convenience store and at night she sells hamburgers and <i> salchipapas <\/i> (dish made out of sausage and potatoes); her husband is a building custodian.

He is married and is the father of three children whose ages average 10 years, all of whom attend school.  In addition to supporting his family, he has two dependent nephews.  He studied until fifth grade, having had to stop school due to his economic and social situation.  He lives with his family in his own house.\r\n\r\nArmindo left Inhembane in 1988 for Maputo, and five years later left the city of Maputo for Boane, where he still lives today with his wife, his children and his nephews.  Having arrived in the area in 1993, he began a business selling locally available construction material (capim - a type of grass), having more than three years of experience selling this type of material.  A sheaf of capim sells for 4,003 MT.  It's very difficult to acquire this material at times, because the capim dries out.\r\n\r\nThe business yields 4,000 MT, with which he manages to support his family and save some money through a traditional savings system (xitique).  This is his second loan with Hluvuku in the amount of 12,000 MT to purchase construction materials for cabins and other types of tourist complexes.  The first loan was for 15,000 MT, also for the same purpose.  \r\n\r\nHe got to know Hluvuku through a friend who is also a client of the institution.  He has never had a loan with another institution, and with the present loan he plans to acquire more raw materials and to be able to employ more people to help in the collection or procurement of material.\r\n\r\nArmindo proposes to pay back the loan as quickly as possible, without problems, in order to be able to obtain other loans for the purpose of constructing an oven for manufacturing bread.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Heidi Petersen, Kiva

He started his business to provide affordable and quality work to residents of New Orleans and has since moved to the commercial and industrial sectors. Five years ago, Damion had to shut down his business after Hurricane Katrina hit the Louisiana coast. Through perserverence and hard work, Damion was able to pull his business together. There was fewer work with fewer people in New Orleans, and also, less people willing to invest in their homes. For people who needed renovation, many unlicensed contractors came to New Orleans and took advantage of that demand. All these factors contributed to making it very difficult for Damion to build his business back up again.\r\n\r\nThis same situation has happened again with the recent oil spill. Damion had seven large residential projects planned before the oil spill that would have brought almost $ 1 million to his company. However, because of the oil spill devastating the area, investors were not as willing to invest in these homes and decided to not go through with the projects. Damion and his 15 employees had been counting on those projects and now he does not have enough money to tide the business over until they get their next big project, which is currently under way. With this loan, Damion plans to  pay his employees and rent big machinery. Without this loan, Damion would not be able to complete this big project and would be forced to let go of some of his employees.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":5250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":5250,"image":{"id":621461,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Construction","sector":"Construction","themes":null,"use":"New

This is her second loan with MFP, and she is very happy to know that she has financial support.  She is pleased to be part of a communal bank, because all of the members are reliable and responsible.  She thanks all those who will manage the loan she is requesting, because it will be very useful in growing her business.

She lives in Rizal, Palawan. \r\n\r\nSylvia joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2006 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past second loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Sylvia has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 10,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 7,000,  uplifting her family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her third cycle loan, Sylvia is borrowing PHP 15,000 to buy additional goods to sell so that she can continue to save up for the future education of her children. Sylvia is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.
