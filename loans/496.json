She owns a business venture, planting & harvesting fruits & vegetables for sale.  Segivao has 3 years of experience in this business.  Segivao needs a loan of WST $1500 to purchase general farm supplies & equipment.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 500 talas or US $208 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nYou can view pictures of a typical vegetable garden in Samoa, taken by a Kiva Fellow, at:   http:\/\/picasaweb.google.com\/agnes.p.chu\/VegetableGarden#\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Segivao joined SPBD.    This is her 3rd loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Segivao's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Segivao I. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.6 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.6 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.8 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2.3 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

He feels that he\u2019s old enough to work and earn his own income and stop being a burden for his family.  So it is that every morning he works the fields his parents left him so that his potato and pea crops will have the proper care that will insure their speedy sale once they are harvested.\r\n\r\nWhat he likes best about his work is the planting; this activity is his only source of income and he\u2019s been in this line of work for three years.  The most difficult part of his work, he thinks, is caring for his plants so that they are protected from the climate changes that so affect productivity.  Later on, he\u2019d like to buy more fields so that he can expand his growing area.\r\n\r\nThis is his 9th loan with MFP and he is sure the loan will be of much benefit in the development of his activity.

She has 500 broiler chickens and 500 laying chickens.  Broiler chickens are raised for between 2 to 6 months before being sold for food.  Laying chickens can be kept for years, laying eggs that are then sold.  Margaret makes 5000 USH per broiler chicken and 5,000 per tray of eggs that she sells.  She is able to collect 10 trays of eggs each day for her laying chickens.  Margaret sells the majority of her broiler chickens wholesale to restaurants in her area.  She explains that the loans are critical to her success in securing these regular customers.  Margaret is able to keep her chickens for 6 months, unlike others who sell sooner, because she can finance her daily expenses during this time with her loans and her sales from her laying chickens.  The loans also allow her to purchase food in bulk, and that reduces the cost.  Margaret has 10 kids.  Four of these children are still in need of help with school fees; in addition, she is helping with seven grandchildren. She is requesting a loan of 900,000 USH to buy more feed for her 1,000 chickens.

He and his family live in Dushanbe, Tajikistan. Zafar started his own small venture after his relatives suggested he should try his luck as a market vendor. Today Zafar runs a small business selling junior clothing, primarily selling to teens and young people. His vending facility has a very favorable location and offers a large assortment of merchandise, and this attracts many customers. \r\n<p>\r\nZafar believes that financial support from IMON International has helped him boost his sales and grow his business. He would like a loan of 5,000 Somoni to purchase inventory wholesale. Zafar believes this loan will help him further develop his business and get additional income to improve his family\u2019s living standards. \r\n<p>\r\nMore about Tajikistan\r\n<p>\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes being a key post along the Silk Road and being the location of the end of the rule of Alexander the Great. It is also known for its famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi, and many others. The country, filled with epic mountain passes, is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, and boasts a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture, and Central Asian traditions. \r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 percent of the country is mountainous and only 7 percent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n<p>\r\nMore about IMON International\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Kabankalan City, Negros Occidental. She earns her living through her general store and pig-fattening businesses.\r\n\r\nJosephine\u2019s husband, Antonio, who is 50 years old, is a policeman.  They have four children between the ages of 4 and 16. The children are currently going to school and also help their parents in the business as part of their daily chores.\r\n\r\nJosephine joined the Kiva field partner, NWTF-Project Dungganon, in 1995 in the hope that she would be able to help her husband improve their family's quality of life. With the help of her loans from NWTF-PD she has been able to increase their family income by engaging in their general store and pig-fattening businesses. Now she earns an average monthly income of $315 from her business activities.\r\n\r\nJosephine is a member of good standing. Her previous loan of 16,000 PHP was used to fund operations for her general store and pig-fattening businesses which had a positive impact on both businesses as well as on the family\u2019s living conditions. Now, in her 21st loan cycle, she is borrowing 20,000 PHP, which she intends to use as additional working capital. Josephine is working hard to achieve her dreams and aspirations for her family, which are to provide them with a brighter future and a more comfortable life.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress out of earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":484400,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

Because they have no children, they are saving up their earnings so that they can support themselves in their old age.\r\n\r\nAgustina joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2002 in the hope that she would be able to help her husband improve their quality of life. With the help of her loans from NWTF-PD she has been able to increase their family income by engaging in fruit vending. Now she earns an average monthly income of Php 18,000 from her business activities.\r\n\r\nAgustina is a member in good standing. In her previous loan cycle, she only borrowed Php 3,000 to augment her working capital for her fruit vending business,  but now that summer is here and fruit is abundant, she is borrowing (for her 14th loan) the amount of Php 15,000, which she intends to use to buy more stock for her fruit vending business. Agustina is working hard to achieve her dreams and aspirations for her family--to provide them with a brighter future and a more comfortable life.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress out of earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":507937,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits &

Alfred finished primary level in school. \r\n\r\nHis business is motorcycle transport. Instead of taking a car as a taxi, people in a hurry in Kigali take a motorcycle taxi which is a very rapid means of transport. He has four years of experience in this business. He began in 2006, renting a motorcycle on a daily basis. When he joined a motorcycle drivers' cooperative, he was able to ask for an ACB loan which he has already paid off, and now he owns his own motorcycle. \r\n\r\nWith ACB he has entered into four loans and has paid off three, which enabled him to become economically independent, as he already has his own motorcycle. Today he is taking out a loan for 400,000 Rwandan Francs to repair his motorcycle by buying spare parts for it: a tank, two tires, two springs, and a piston ring, and paying the cost of a new driving license so that he can comfortably continue his work. His ambition is to reimburse his loan in a timely manner so that the Bank will accord him a big loan to buy a car to use as a taxi. \r\n\r\nIn the future, he intends to have his own house since he is presently renting, and also have his own car as well as getting married so as to have children. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Teresa Kramer, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":554005,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Motorcycle Transport","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"buying spare parts to repair his motorcycle","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"RW","country":"Rwanda","town":"Kicukiro-Kigali","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 30","type":"point"}},"partner_id":170,"posted_date":"2010-06-16T07:20:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":700,"lender_count":26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alfred","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"RWF","disbursal_amount":400000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":175}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":350,"local_amount":200000,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T09:15:56Z","rounded_local_amount":202650,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159577523},{"amount":350,"local_amount":200000,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T09:27:26Z","rounded_local_amount":202650,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166788079}],"funded_date":"2010-06-16T18:07:30Z","paid_date":"2010-09-15T09:27:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":211672,"name":"Teo","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Teo is married with three children and all her children go to school.

She used to have a store in a large crafts market in Ayacucho, but it was no longer profitable, so now she sells her work from home. She has been doing embroidery since she was 15 years old, and today she has many regular clients and receives orders from Lima. She pays seven workers to embroider blouses that she sews. She sells long-sleeved blouses for 25 soles and short-sleeved blouses for 20 soles; she earns 13.50 soles in profits per blouse.

Her goal for the future is to open a store in central Ayacucho to sell clothing and rent out the costumes she makes. She thinks this could be a very profitable business, because just one rental covers the cost of making the costumes, so any future rental is 100% profit.  \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":239824,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Embroidery","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"Buy fabric and pay embroiderers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":70,"posted_date":"2008-12-19T02:50:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":500,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Reyna Isabel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-12-13T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2009-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2009-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2009-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":375}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":125,"local_amount":375,"processed_date":"2009-01-09T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T12:06:41Z","rounded_local_amount":386.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":10215260},{"amount":125,"local_amount":375,"processed_date":"2009-02-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T08:22:21Z","rounded_local_amount":386.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20396970},{"amount":250,"local_amount":750,"processed_date":"2009-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T18:16:39Z","rounded_local_amount":772.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27088646}],"funded_date":"2008-12-19T06:58:14Z","paid_date":"2009-04-15T18:16:39Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"April Newman","image":122414}},{"id":83834,"name":"Ulviyya","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ulviyya M. is a 22-year-old woman who lives with her husband and daughter in the small village of Saatli, Azerbaijan.

G. lives in the town of Santiago Nonualco in the La Paz department.  Marta, 48, is a single mother.  She lives with her mother and her two minor children.  Her children go to school.  Marta has a difficult time looking for work because she does not have an education.  El Salvador is a very small country, and its employment opportunities are also small.

Soliya is a woman who on a daily basis seeks for the bettering of her four children. She works with great effort for them and wants to continue to do so to build a prominent and promising future. Ever since she was a young girl, she has been dedicated to farming activities. She was raised this way and it has been a stable source of income until this day. For more than 15 years Soliya has raised sheep and she also grows some products on her land. \r\n\r\nIn order to continue to work and to obtain a very good quantity and quality, Soliya wants to borrow money for growing vegetables and buying sheep. Let\u2019s show solidarity to this self-less widow mother who looks for what is best for her children.  \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Today, he is seeking a way to expand his farming efforts in order to support his family, which consists of his wife and 5 children. Tilibboy faces lack of capital financing for the production of potatoes, wheat and oats. For this reason, he trustfully approached IMON to ask for a loan for that activity. In this way, he can continue supporting his humble home and develop his business economically.    \r\n \r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She lives in the Kigamboni area of Dar es Salaam. She has been in this business for years now. Mwajabu thanks all her lenders for her first loan with Kiva. She has repaid the loan in full. With the loan money she received, Mwajabu replenished her stock of cosmetics and she has had success selling her products. She hopes to continue to grow her cosmetics business by increasing her stock of cosmetics and introducing women's clothing in her shop. This could help her do more business. When a customer comes for cosmetics, she\u2019ll also have a chance to view some clothes. The new line of business also needs some additional funding. She requests a loan worth USD 750 to increase her stock of cosmetics and purchase the right quantity of clothes.\r\n <p>Mwajabu\u2019s success with cosmetics has stoked her entrepreneurial spirit, and she now also operates a second business in the transportation industry. She has purchased, with the help of her husband, a commuter bus that operates in the Kigamboni neighborhood. The city of Dar es Salaam does not provide bus services; rather, bus services are a private enterprise. Buses (called Dala Dalas) are owned by private individuals who rent them to drivers. The driver pays the owner a certain amount each day and anything he\/she makes over that amount is theirs to keep. Mwajabu has purchased a Dala Dala for a route in Kigamboni and makes money renting out the vehicle to service the growing number of residents.\r\n<p>Her income from these ventures helps pay for family expenses and school fees for her children.

Kuku means chickens in Swahili, and raising them for sale is popular for a number of reasons. \r\n\r\nFirstly, they require little start-up capital.  You can start with one or two and either add to them as you go, or wait for them to multiply naturally!  \r\n\r\nSecondly, they require little space, so sometimes you can just let them run around in your garden or compound.  \r\n\r\nThirdly, while they are growing they produce eggs, which can either be sold to provide a supplementary source of income, or eaten to provide a supplementary source of protein.  \r\n\r\nI\u2019m sure there are hundreds of other reasons why raising kuku is so popular (maybe they are friendlier than other animals?

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n<P>\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is a married woman with two children. She has a diversified activity. She is developing a commercial business selling various products as well a poultry farming business. She has ten years of experience in her activities. She is asking for a loan of 300,000 francs with which she intends to buy toys, sheets, nappies, shoes, bags, hair weaves (\"greffages\") and clothes that she will sell in her shop, which lies opposite the market in Ouakam. Her goods are often adapted to the needs of her clients depending on the occasion. What interests her most in her business is the contact with her customers and the fact that she gets to attend to them. This loan will allow her to expand the range of products she can offer to her customers with a view to satisfying their needs. The resulting increase in her profits will allow her to invest more in the poultry farming business. \r\n\r\nIn line with its ongoing vision to participate actively in the battle against poverty,

She lives i nher own house with her husband, Jose, who is 42. He works as a driver and they have two small children. For three years, this enterprising woman has worked as a merchant of turrones (traditional Peruvian sweets). This activity is only popular from September through November, which are the months that the \"Lord of the Miracles\" is remembered (a tradition linked to the Liman Christ). During the other months she makes sandwiches and french fries with sausage outside of her house in her sandwich cart that she takes out of her house every day. Although she only does the work from 6 p.m. until 11 p.m., she says that it gives her good income. Since she is an enterprising woman she plans on expanding her sandwich selling business in the future so her patrons will be more comfortable. That is why she wants to buy tables and chairs. This is the seventh loan that she has had with MFP and she promises to make her payments on time.

To overcome these problems they decided to join into one group so it's easier to communicate among members of the group and more easily get funding. \r\n\r\nNi Wayan, 30, is head of the Rejasa group and runs a pig breeding business. To grow the business, Ni Wayan invited group members to participate in loan programs for small businesses from MUK. This loan will be used to buy three piglets and pig feed.

When she got sick, her son took over the business--its popularity is due to the efforts of his mother. \r\n\r\nBecause of the difficulties that Presentaci\u00f3n has faced such as the economic crisis, he is seeking a loan for working capital and to buy corn, masa (corn flour), firewood etc. His greatest dream is to expand and improve his business so that his children can continue this way of life.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jane Agg, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1025,"image":{"id":349290,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"working capital","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Leon","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.435556 -86.879444","type":"point"}},"partner_id":96,"posted_date":"2009-07-08T15:50:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1025,"lender_count":39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Presentacion Jesus","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-06-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2009-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2009-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2009-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2009-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2010-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2010-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2010-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":2500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.13},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.13},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":128.13},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":128.13},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":128.13},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":128.13},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.13},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.09}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":128.13,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2009-08-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T15:26:42Z","rounded_local_amount":2536.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73599974},{"amount":128.13,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2009-09-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T17:49:52Z","rounded_local_amount":2536.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87035863},{"amount":128.13,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2009-10-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T21:34:12Z","rounded_local_amount":2536.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96948257},{"amount":0.14,"local_amount":2.77,"processed_date":"2009-11-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T12:32:08Z","rounded_local_amount":2.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103790187},{"amount":132.73,"local_amount":2589.91,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T12:33:06Z","rounded_local_amount":2627.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103790188},{"amount":129.79,"local_amount":2532.5,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T13:33:55Z","rounded_local_amount":2569.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110680854},{"amount":127.87,"local_amount":2495.01,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:35:06Z","rounded_local_amount":2531.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118075390},{"amount":121.99,"local_amount":2379.81,"processed_date":"2010-02-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:08:15Z","rounded_local_amount":2414.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123911440},{"amount":128.09,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2010-03-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-06T07:50:12Z","rounded_local_amount":2536.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128947287}],"funded_date":"2009-07-16T17:13:35Z","paid_date":"2010-05-06T07:50:12Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jane A"}},{"id":124826,"name":"Shadrach","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Shadrach is 44 years old and married with eight children.

provide for the future of her two young children, ages one and five years old. She hopes that by providing them with a better education, they will be able to help her and her husband in their old age. \r\n\r\nElsie and her family live in Hacienda San Jose Baling, Libacao, Himamaylan City, Negros Occidental. Her husband buys and sells livestock in neighboring towns. Elsie became engaged in food vending to supplement her husband's income. Grilled food is popular among Filipinos, and Negros in particular is famous for its barbecue chicken. Hence, Elsie decided to offer her clients a wide variety of grilled and barbecued food served hot off the grill. Elsie bought charcoal in bulk for her food business, and now also sells that to her neighbors to make extra money. \r\n\r\nFor two years, Elsie has enjoyed tending to her food business and helping her husband support their family. Her business earns an extra PHP6,000 per month. Elsie conscientiously divides her income, setting aside a certain amount for her children's future and to budget for her family's needs. She invests the rest of her money back into her business, and is a good money manager. She paid off her last loan, taken out for PHP15,000, with no problems. \r\n\r\nNow on her seventh loan, Elsie wants to borrow PHP16,000 so that she can purchase livestock, which she intends to raise and sell in the future. The income from this venture will again be saved for her children's education and to make repairs to her house. In this photo, Elsie is posing near her food business with a display of barbecued chicken parts, hot dogs and bread on a stick.

While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nErlinda is married and has 7 adult-aged children. To make a living, Erlinda owns & operates a business venture in the retail sector running a general store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling both food & daily use products in the local community. Erlinda has been engaged in her business for over 8 years and earns approximately 6000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Erlinda joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Erlinda has successfully repaid a previous loan of 14,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Erlinda is requesting a new loan of 15000 PHP which will be used to purchase new items to expand product offering. This loan will be the sixth loan taken out by Erlinda from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of the borrower's family. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\nIMON's History\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She lives in the urban region of the city of Cuenca.  Mar\u00eda Isabel is 40; and she has four children, 22, 21, 16, and 8.  Her first child is married and lives independently with his family.  Her second child studies at CEDEC, and he works for his personal expenses.  The other two children are in elementary and high school.  Mar\u00eda Isabel\u2019s husband emigrated to the exterior, and he sends them money to pay some of the household expenses.  They do not have their own house; they rent.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda Isabel raises chickens.  She has been doing this for two years, and it is going very well.  She tells us that with her business she pays debts.  With the small earnings that she gets, she increases her business to make it more productive.\r\n\r\nThis is her third cycle working with her communal bank.  She is very grateful for all of the benefits she has.\r\n\r\nWith the loan received she will buy more chicks, food, and vitamins for her chickens, and increase her business.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda Isabel\u2019s dream is to have her own house to give her children tranquility.\r\n\r\nRosa Mar\u00eda M. P. is one of the happiest members of the Novatas Communal Bank.  She lives in the urban region of the city of Cuenca.  She is 39, married, and has six children.  They are 25, 22, 20, 18, 15, and 13.  Her first two children are married and have their own families.  The four youngest children go to school and work for their expenses.  Her husband emigrated to the exterior.  Due to the world crisis, he sends them money only when he can.  She does not have her own house; she rents.\r\n\r\nRosa raises chickens.  She has had the business for three years, and it is going very well because she has orders from fixed customers.  When she has time, she works in her son\u2019s upholstery shop.\r\n\r\nThis is her third cycle with the Fundaci\u00f3n Espor.  She is very proud of the improvement she has made thanks to the loans she received.  With the loan from the Foundation she will buy food for the chickens because she wants to expand the business.\r\n\r\nHer dream is to have a business selling wood and to expand her chicken business to give her children a better future.\r\n\r\nLourdes de la Nube Zhispun P. is a member of the Novatas Communal Bank.  She lives in the Medio Ejido area, an urban region of the city of Cuenca.  She is happily married, 29, and she has four children.  She is three months pregnant with her fifth child.  She tells us that this pregnancy is giving her some complications, and she has to spend more time resting.  She lives in a rented house.  Her husband works in an upholstery shop.  They are a stable family.\r\n\r\nLourdes works in her own beauty station.  She knows a lot about cuts and styles that are in fashion because she has worked in this area of beauty for 14 years.  She has 12 years of experience.  She has her own customers.  She has worked in her own business for seven months because she bought the place.\r\n\r\nThis is her third loan with the Foundation.  She is very happy because the money the Foundation loans her pays for the installments on her place.  She also gets more beauty products to put in her showcase.\r\n\r\nHer goal is to expand her beauty location and open other branches.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny

They are his inpiration to gain a better life.  For the past 20 years, Adolfo has operated a mechanic's shop for motorcycles and moto-cars.  His shop is located on a portion of his land because there isn't a better place available for him to work quietly.  In addition to his workshop, Adolfo had the opportunity to purchase a moto-taxi for himself, and during his free time he either transports passengers with it or rents it to other taxi drivers who are without access to a moto-taxi.  When he rents his moto-taxi, his earnings also increase at the mechanic's shop because he has more time to simply interact with his clients and thus create permanent clients who return to him time after time.  Currently, he is hoping to find a different plot of land where he can build his workshop, in order to have it in a more convenient location.  This is Adolfo's fourth loan with Micro-Finanzas Prisma, and he is very reliable when it comes to his loan repayments.  He plans to invest the loan in his mechanic's workshop by purchasing new tools so that he can take better care of his clients' needs.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Suzy Marinkovich, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":460981,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Auto Repair","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"Purchase of tools and renovation of mechanic's workshop","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-12-30T16:20:17Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":525,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Adolfo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-12-10T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":228.4},{"due_date":"2010-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":232.05},{"due_date":"2010-03-09T08:00:00Z","amount":247.59},{"due_date":"2010-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":253.61},{"due_date":"2010-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":264.1},{"due_date":"2010-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":274.25}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.94},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.22},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.65},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":88.77},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92.43},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.99}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":79.94,"local_amount":228.4,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:10:46Z","rounded_local_amount":230.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118124420},{"amount":81.22,"local_amount":232.05,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:49:28Z","rounded_local_amount":233.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123960161},{"amount":86.65,"local_amount":247.59,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:33:22Z","rounded_local_amount":249.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128993005},{"amount":88.77,"local_amount":253.61,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:38:20Z","rounded_local_amount":255.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136717791},{"amount":92.43,"local_amount":264.1,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:40:11Z","rounded_local_amount":266.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144751466},{"amount":95.99,"local_amount":274.25,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:03:23Z","rounded_local_amount":276.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151933923}],"funded_date":"2009-12-30T17:48:08Z","paid_date":"2010-07-15T10:03:23Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Suzy Marinkovich","image":313359}},{"id":170200,"name":"Norie","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Norie E. is from the village of Omunay, Damulog, Bukidnon.

The group is called \u201cMujeres Maravilla\u201d (\u201cWonder Women\u201d) and is made up of 19 very active women from the same area who show great solidarity with one another.  They have different business activities, and some group members were able to start new businesses in order to generate income and thus support their families.  For example, Mrs. Ignacia V. did not have a business, but after joining this committee she became enthusiastic and started working as a street vendor selling clothing. She travels around, visiting commercial establishments in remote areas of the city. She earns good money and feels very fulfilled. She is happy to be able to help her family improve their quality of life.

It is a small rural community with around 2,000 inhabitants, mostly producing milk and coffee beans. The area has hilly terrain and a lot of it is tropical rain forest. There are some real beauty spots, where the tropical forest meets two lovely lakes, coffee plantations and dairy farms. \r\n\r\nIn a little over two years, Alexander has developed himself into a micro-entrepreneur, with a small business producing milk and milk products such as cheese and cream. His children have helped him keep the home and business running, even helping to make and market the produce. He says he is very happy with this project: it has increased his confidence and provided income to improve their living conditions despite difficulties that have befallen the little community - indeed it has enabled him to keep his family together, as it means he has not had to leave to find work in the city. Now Alexander needs a loan of 623,000 colones ($1200) in order to buy a milk cow from his neighbour. With this cow he will be able to increase his production, generate more income, and continue to develop as an entrepreneur.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Rosa Oswald, Kiva

D., a married woman living in Prk. Indol, Brgy. Nangka, Bayawan City, Negros Oriental, earns her living by operating two enterprises:  a general Store and a chopsachem dealership. Her husband, Nestor D., 49, works as a rice operator to earn a living.  They have four children ranging in age from 14 to 23. Flora joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2008 because she aspired to something better for her family. <p>\r\n\r\nWith the help of her past 19 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Flora has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 19,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 4,000, thus uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time she is borrowing PHP 19,500 to buy more stocks and new products for her general store so that she can continue to save up for the future of her children and for home repairs. Flora D. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams. <p>\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.<p>\r\n\r\nHelp NWTF continue its mission to help the poorest in the Philippines by clicking the link to the NWTF Kiva lending team  on Kiva.org to join our
