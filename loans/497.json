Without the loan they would continue being employees of someone else, earning a minimum wage which would not give them enough to either begin a career or leave poverty.  \r\n\r\n<P>Nevertheless, the adult women told me that at the moment of receiving a loan they are touched, but at the same time they feel a little fear because they do not know if they are going to be able repay the debt.  It is a very understandable feeling since is a new experience through which they and all the women of their generation are passing.  In spite of that, they have already completed five loans with Friendship Bridge.  \r\n\r\n<P>A detail that leaps to light was that the majority of members of this group worked selling second-hand items.  Four clients commented that they went to the city of Guatemala, a trip of approximately four hours, to buy second-hand items in order to sell them in Suchitepequez which is a regional capital that is located to another four hours from the town of Nahuala.  The interesting thing about these trips is that the women travel to completely different destinations and therefore compete with people from other cultures that are not theirs.  This is something really impressive since traditionally the women are confined inside a native community and do not tend to travel a lot.  Another detail that reflects a modernist cut of this group is that ten women among the youths and adults have just bought cell phones.  \r\n\r\n<P>Two clients will invest their credit in wood to work in carpentry.  Two others have a bakery.  Others sell and weave clothes.  As can be seen in this group one can find a variety of important businesses.  \r\n\r\n<P>The Red Roses is a group of women that is exploring different roads, so that in some way they can avoid being faced with the saturation of the market by opting for businesses that have not been explored by the remainder of women in their communities.  Supporting a group of creative and innovative women is important to promote the development of micro-business and of Guatemala.

A pesar de eso, ya llevaban con Friendship Bridge cinco cr\u00e9ditos. \r\n\r\n<P>Un detalle que salto a luz fue que la mayor\u00eda de integrantes de este grupo trabajaban vendiendo trastes. Cuatro clientas comentaron que se iban a la ciudad de Guatemala un viaje de aproximadamente cuatro horas a comprar trastes para luego irlos a vender hasta Suchitepequez la cual es una cabecera departamental que est\u00e1 ubicada a otras cuatro horas del pueblo de Nahuala. Lo interesante de estos viajes es que las mujeres viajan a destinos completamente distintos y por ende lidiando con gente de otras culturas que no son las suyas. Algo realmente impresionante ya que tradicionalmente las mujeres dentro de una comunidad ind\u00edgena est\u00e1n confinadas y no tienden a viajar mucho. Otro detalle que refleja un corte vanguardista de este grupo es que diez mujeres entre j\u00f3venes y adultas acaban de comprar celulares. \r\n\r\n<P>Dos clientas invierten su cr\u00e9dito en madera para trabajar en carpinter\u00eda. Otras dos tienen un panader\u00eda, otras venden y tejen ropa. Como se puede ver en este grupo uno puede encontrar una variedad de negocios importante. \r\n\r\n<P>Las Rojas Rosas es un grupo de mujeres que est\u00e1 explorando distintos caminos, que de alguna manera est\u00e1n evitando enfrentarse a la saturaci\u00f3n de mercado al optar por negocios no muy explorado por el resto de mujeres en sus comunidades. Apoyar a un grupo de mujeres innovadoras y creativas es importante para promover el desarrollo de la microempresa y de Guatemala. Gracias por tomarlas en cuenta."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4100,"image":{"id":156532,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing

In the first round of loan, she borrowed 2.000.000 VND to purchase cosmetic products and equipment for her salon. Before joining TYM, her shop was small; customers were often acquaintances. But since she invested more in her salon with the help of TYM, it has become increasingly popular, helping her earn about 70.000 to 100.000 per day. For the past 5 years, Mrs. H. has been using loans from TYM Fund to purchase new equipment, enhancing the quality of her salon. She also attended a make-up course, so she can give advice to her customers. As a result, her salon is now one of the best in her area. Now, Mrs. H. has to hire one employee to help her with all the work, with a salary of 1.000.000 VND per month. At the end of the year in particular, she has to hire 2 persons to assist her. Mrs. H.\u2019s monthly income is 5.000.000 VND. In the next round of loan, she would like to borrow 17.000.000 VND ($1025) to purchase more high-quality cosmetic products and modern equipment for her salon to attract more customers. <a><br \/><p><strong>Translated from Vietnamese by KH.

David entered the world of micro-business in 1993. He would go from village to village bartering salted fish and soap for bags of cassava and corn, which he then sold in Kinshasa. This business supported him while he finished his high school studies in 1998. After the company where he was working closed in 2002, David once again took up bartering in different villages until he opened his own telephone booth in Kinshasa in 2002 using the profits he had accumulated. He plans to use the next loan from Hope to buy prepaid phone cards and sell them in order to increase the income from his business, which provides him with a weekly profit of $35. His ambition is to open a pharmacy, given the increasing need for medicines. David is 36 years old, married and the father of four children aged between two and eight. Two of the children are at primary school.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Sarah Llewellyn, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3150,"image":{"id":350235,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":["Conflict Zones"],"use":"To buy prepaid phone cards to sell in order to increase the income generated by the business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CD","country":"Congo (Dem.

The official name of this borrowing group is Felicidad S. Group.\r\n\r\nFelicidad is married and has 1 school-aged child. To make a living, Felicidad owns & operates a transportation business. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from providing motorcycle transport in the local community. Felicidad has been engaged in her business for over 3 years and earns approximately 4500 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Felicidad joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Felicidad is requesting a new loan of 5000 PHP which will be used to repair a transport vehicle used in the business. This will be the first loan taken out by Felicidad from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 29 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Having more goods to sell will increase the returns and improve the family's situation.\n\nLubna's husband appears in the picture here as she comes from a religious background and doesn't want her picture posted online.\n\nImportant information about this loan:\n\nFATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan. For more information on lending in the Muslim world, please visit our FAQs.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":825,"image":{"id":633069,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Electronics

She is known for her friendly personality.\r\n\r\nFor the last ten years Mar\u00eda has earned her living selling fast food. She does this every day from early in the morning. It took a lot of sacrifice to get the business going, but she drew on her mother\u2019s experience as she also used to sell fast food. However, it was a friend in the same line of work who told Mar\u00eda that such a business would be profitable. Daily hard work has meant that she has been able to pay for the family\u2019s expenses. Her greatest wish is to buy more stock for her business and also to open a store in her home.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda will use the loan to buy more merchandise for her business (beer for example).\r\n\r\nShe is the president of the Alcom \u201cEl Progreso D.

They live in their own home located in the town of Puente Paucartambo (Peruvian central jungle). As a working woman, she helps her husband with the household expenses.  Agriculture, her husband\u2019s business, provides the necessary for survival \u201cfood and shelter\u201d.  But, with an entrepreneurial air, Marcela told us that 7 years ago she opened a small food store, where she sells basic goods.  From the early hours of the morning, the inhabitants of her town visit the store, since they know the level of stock she maintains. In her free time, she sews. Everyone knows her and they are constantly seeking her out to offer her work. In addition, she says that in the harvest season she buys and sells coffee \u2013 buying tins of dried coffee from agricultural producers for .80 New Peruvian Soles and reselling them at a profit to a recognized company for .88 New Peruvian Soles. \u201cI have to take advantage of the harvest,\u201d she affirms.  The customers she has gained caused her to increase her sales, which is why in the future she wants to buy herself an industrial machine with which she is sure she will be able to sew easier and faster.  She belongs to the communal bank \u201cLuz del Future\u201d \u201c(Light of the Future) and this is her sixth loan with MFP, where she is waiting for a small loan so that she can reach her goals.  Moreover, she promises once again to make all her payments, as was the case with her previous loans.  In addition, she is grateful to be part of a communal bank, because all the members are responsible and supportive people. Marcela, having obtained your support, will invest the requested loan in the purchase of coffee, since they are in harvest season.                                                                                                      \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":789825,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy coffee.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-06-13T17:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marcela ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-05-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":147.09},{"due_date":"2011-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":154.44},{"due_date":"2011-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":162.16},{"due_date":"2011-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":170.27},{"due_date":"2011-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":178.79},{"due_date":"2011-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":187.25}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.16},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.91},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.81},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.86},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":67.04},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.22}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":55.16,"local_amount":147.09,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:33:32Z","rounded_local_amount":152.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216550462},{"amount":57.91,"local_amount":154.44,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T09:14:00Z","rounded_local_amount":159.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221719142},{"amount":60.81,"local_amount":162.16,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-17T08:13:28Z","rounded_local_amount":167.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227350606},{"amount":63.86,"local_amount":170.27,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:47:46Z","rounded_local_amount":176.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232851046},{"amount":67.04,"local_amount":178.79,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:58:13Z","rounded_local_amount":185.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238666206},{"amount":70.22,"local_amount":187.25,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:42:36Z","rounded_local_amount":193.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244621341}],"funded_date":"2011-06-15T15:14:24Z","paid_date":"2011-12-15T10:42:36Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jacqueline Demeranville","image":1016015}},{"id":310489,"name":"Mirgul's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mirgul is the leader of this group.

One of them is 7 years old and is in primary school and her other daughter is 2 years old. \r\n\r\nShe sells ornamental plants. She is asking for a loan in order to buy plants, clay pots, decorative stones, and paints. She began this business a year ago. She began by selling plants without flowerpots, but as her clients are very special she began to put the plants in painted and decorated pots so that they would appear prettier. She bought the plants by selling pozoles, tostadas, and quesadillas on Saturdays and Sundays. \r\n\r\nHer business is important because she can provide for her two daughters who are little, the oldest in school. From her earnings in her business she provides them with milk and school fees for her daughter. She feels proud of having her own business.\r\n\r\nHer clients are tourists that come to visit her magical city for the mummy museum, the hills and the pottery. She has her stand in the city center and does not have to worry about the changes of weather, such as when it rains.

He has had this job for more than 20 years and has a salary of 8.000.00mt per month, which he uses for household expenses and savings in his bank account (BCI).  \r\n\r\nHe had a loan in another bank (BIM) and paid it off without any problems.  He later learned about Hluvuku through a colleague who is also a client.  This is his third loan with Hluvuku, in the amount of 20.000.00mt, which he will use to purchase materials (metal panels, glass panes, cement, iron, sand, beams, etc.) to continue construction on his home.  \r\n\r\nHe promises to make payments on time.  In the future he plans to complete construction on his home and he intends to request more loans from Hluvuku for that purpose.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":904783,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing

Three of them live in Lima, while the youngest lives at home. Being the child of farmers, Eleuterio has worked the land from a very young age, however for the past 2 years, he has also worked twice a month selling meat. From this he earns at least 150 soles of profit. Although the meat business is quite profitable, Eleuterio says he does not feel comfortable with this work, he much prefers agricultural work. Growing and caring for his plants fills him with satisfaction, and harvesting his product and bringing it to market can earn good money.\r\n\r\nThis hard-working farmer does not lose his hope to eventually plant great quantities, but at different times, a method which allows him to build capital and purchase more land to cultivate. Eleuterio tries not to miss a single scheduled meeting of his village bank, and in the last cycle he was responsible for transmitting advice from the consultant to the other members. This is his fifth loan, and in this whole time he has been very responsible with his payments. The money he is requesting will be used to buy fertilizers to feed his plants, and pesticides to protect his potatoes from worms. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Emily Martyn, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":950,"image":{"id":269811,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Purchasing fertilizers and pesticides","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-02-15T00:30:11Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":950,"lender_count":32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Eleuterio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":950,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":3000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":950}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":950,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2009-11-18T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:55:16Z","rounded_local_amount":3076.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103841936}],"funded_date":"2009-02-15T18:47:12Z","paid_date":"2009-12-15T13:55:16Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Emily Martyn","image":null}},{"id":92494,"name":"Nelly Del Socorro Mercado","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":" \nNelly M. es una dama muy trabajadora cuya labor es la venta de colchones desde hace 5 a\u00f1os siendo este un negocio que le ha ayudado a desarrollarse y proporcionar mejores condiciones a su familia.\n\nA sus 50 a\u00f1os de edad, como toda mujer nicarag\u00fcense ella se caracteriza por ser una excelente trabajadora con el prop\u00f3sito de llevar el bienestar a su casa de habitaci\u00f3n.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <p>\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <p>\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Two years ago she started selling groceries and other basic goods from her home.  Ana works hard to offer good service to her customers, keeping her store open from 6 am to 8 pm, 6 days a week.  What she likes about her work is that she makes many friends, and most importantly earns the trust of her customers.

She tells us that they are a very happy family. \r\n<P>\r\nCarmen works selling beauty products to women such as those of the Yambal brand; she began this business 5 months ago and things are going very well because she has a large clientele, her products are well known, and the products have been well accepted in the market. One difficulty that she has faced is that she has to walk a great deal because she visits her clients from house to house, with the great advantage that her products are good and sell well. \r\n<P>\r\nShe is in her third loan cycle working with her Communal Bank, and she likes the way that they have been taught to save and that they do not have to carry out many transactions to gain access to loans. \r\n<P>\r\nThe loan obtained through the Foundation will be invested in the purchase of an assorted stock of Yambal products to satisfy her clients\u2019 requests. \r\n<P>\r\nHer goal is to continue expanding her sales of Yambal beauty products, and to gain the \u2018Number 1 Star\u2019 honor given by the company. \r\n<P>\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Mariela

On average they are 31 years old with 4 children and live in the Djaka (Kirango) neighborhood of Markala (4th administrative Region of the republic of Mali).  This group is united by bonds of kinship, marriage, friendship, and neighborhood.  They are members of the traditional \"Traor\u00e9 Ton\" association that gave its name to their current association.  Their activity is the sale of fish in various forms.  Sabougnouman is a group that collaborates with Soro Yiriwaso and that is on its 5th loan, after having repaid the preceding ones well.  This new loan will be used to buy 10 baskets of fresh fish and 50 blocks of ice (furnished by the carriers coming from Bamako).  They supply themselves with fresh fish on the spot by the river Niger.  A good part of this fish is dried on gravel, on straw or on one of the \"dryers\". The fish is sold in various ways: the fresh fish are sometimes sold on the spot by the river, in Kirango and in Diamarabougou Markala in the market or on foot in the neighborhoods.  The fresh fish is packed in ice and sold in S\u00e9gou (in the market house).  Part of the dried fish is preserved until winter, when they earn more money and is sold in the markets of Dougabougou, Siribala, Boussin and S\u00e9gou. They generally sell the fish themselves to a cash clientele composed of women and men.  They hope to realize a monthly average profit of 37,000 FCFA that will serve to satisfy their small family needs.  Their ambition is to buy and raise animals in order to construct their own houses in the future.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Barbara (B) Brown, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1375,"image":{"id":420645,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish Selling","sector":"Food","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"To buy fish and ice","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"S\u00e9gou","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2009-11-07T15:50:13Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1375,"lender_count":37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maman                   ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bata                   ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bama                     ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marama                  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Magnini                        ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rokia                 ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maman                   ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yaye      ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-10-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":600000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2010-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2010-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2010-03-14T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2010-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":229.17},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":229.16},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":229.17},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":229.17},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":229.16},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":229.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":229.17,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-11-14T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:57:04Z","rounded_local_amount":101340.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103873793},{"amount":229.16,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-12-14T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T17:04:35Z","rounded_local_amount":101340.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110763523},{"amount":229.17,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2010-01-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-16T09:31:47Z","rounded_local_amount":101340.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118152338},{"amount":229.17,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2010-02-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T11:18:45Z","rounded_local_amount":101340.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123991192},{"amount":229.16,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2010-03-14T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T10:00:01Z","rounded_local_amount":101340.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":129021459},{"amount":229.17,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2010-04-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T12:15:12Z","rounded_local_amount":101340.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136746259}],"funded_date":"2009-11-09T03:54:07Z","paid_date":"2010-05-15T12:15:12Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"B Brown","image":120650}},{"id":154112,"name":"Chean","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Chean R., 30, lives in the province of Kompong Tom, Cambodia and has been a vegetable trader for more than a year.

L. was born in the Marracuene District, Maputo Province.  She is 51 years old, a widow, and the mother of 4 children.  One is 15 years old and still in school.  She lives in her own house with her children in the Boane District in the town of Mafuiane, and supports two grandchildren that live with her.\r\n\r\nShe left Marracuene for Boane at 19 years old, when she married her husband.  She has worked as a farmer for more than 30 years.  She owns 2 parcels of land that are 2 hectares each; she grows greens\/vegetables and grains with the help of an assistant and her children.  She works from 7am to 4pm every day, and brings in about 12,000 MZN in 45 days.  She uses this for housing expenses and she even saves some through Xitique (a traditional system of revolving savings).\r\n\r\nShe has never had loans through other banks.  She became familiar with Hluvuku through some friends who are clients of this institution.  She is her 4th loan.  It has a value of 13,000 MZN, and she plans to use it to buy agricultural supplies (seeds, insecticides, fertilizers, etc.) in order to expand into more areas of production and offer products with better quality.  Her previous loans were for 2,800, 11,000, 11,000, and 15,000 MZN, all for the same purpose.\r\n\r\nIn the future, she would like to request more loans to build a coop, so she can raise chickens to butcher.\r\n <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Erika Korowin, Kiva

They own their own home and live there with two of their four children. \r\n\r\nFor 30 years, Julia has been a farmer, growing potatoes, peas, beans, and corn on her own land as well as on rented fields. She wakes up very early every morning to work in the fields with her husband. In her free time, she knits sweaters for men and women, which she is able to sell for approximately $25 each. Seasonally, she also sells clothing to her acquaintances on credit. \r\n\r\nJulia does not complain about working so hard. She knows that it ensures that she has enough income to cover her household expenses, to pay her children's school fees, and to save money for unexpected expenses. She would like to rent more land to increase her harvest and generate more income from farming. \r\n\r\nThis is her first loan from MFP. She has enjoyed working with her communal bank because they are teaching her to be responsible and, above all, on-time with her payments. She will use the loan to purchase two bags of peas.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Kris Vickery, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":521042,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Purchase 2 bags of peas","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-04-08T11:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Julia","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":350}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":350,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:25:31Z","rounded_local_amount":1001.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172153980}],"funded_date":"2010-04-08T21:01:33Z","paid_date":"2010-10-15T10:25:31Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"k vickery","image":389145}},{"id":195770,"name":"Oyuntsetseg","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Oyuntsetseg is 34 years old and lives with her husband and three children in Ulaanbaatar, the capital city of Mongolia.

This 35-year-old, dynamic businessman has reached a point where his profits are now 900,000 Ugandan shillings a month. With steady progress in his small business, he reckons his future prospects are rising with every passing day.\r\n\r\nWith this loan, Donadi has the conviction that he will be able to buy more cash crops such as maize and beans so that he does not run short of stock. This will improve his sales revenue and will enable him to have a self-sustaining life as he looks to the future to educating his children. In that way, they will become important people who can support themselves in the

In Bali, people buy pigs for consumption and for religious ceremonies. A pig can sell for $35 - $40. All her sales reached $300 with a net profit of $70 after all expenses for the feed. This income has not been able to support her family of 5. \r\n\r\n<p> With this second loan, Ni Kadek Wartini needs an additional capital of $150, which will be used to buy 2 more sows.

Kebiasaan yang ada di Bali adalah keperluan daging babi untuk konsumsi dan keperluan untuk upacara keagamaan. Harga per ekornya mencapai Rp. 350.000.- sampai dengan  Rp. 400.000,- Total penjualan seluruhnya dapat mencapai Rp. 3.000.000,-Keuntungan bersih mencapai Rp. 700.000,- setelah dikurangi semua pengeluaran untuk pakan. Dari pendapatan ini belum bisa menopang kehidupan keluarganya yang berjumlah 5 orang. Dengan pinjaman tahap kedua ini, Ni Kadek Wartini membutuhkan tambahan modal usaha Rp. 1.400.000.- Pinjaman ini akan dibelikan  2 ekor  induk lagi  sehingga keuntungan akan lebih banyak lagi, sehingga dapat membantu pendapatan suami untuk mencukupi kebutuhan keluarganya"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":150,"image":{"id":168194,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy pig sows","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Melaya, Bali","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":82,"posted_date":"2008-06-09T05:30:12Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":150,"lender_count":3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ni Kadek Wartini","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-06-23T06:14:18Z","disbursal_currency":"IDR","disbursal_amount":1400000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":233333.33},{"due_date":"2008-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":233333.33},{"due_date":"2008-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":233333.33},{"due_date":"2008-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":233333.33},{"due_date":"2008-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":233333.33},{"due_date":"2008-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":233333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":25,"local_amount":233333.33,"processed_date":"2008-07-23T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T02:43:15Z","rounded_local_amount":235192.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":274834},{"amount":25,"local_amount":233333.33,"processed_date":"2008-08-23T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T02:44:11Z","rounded_local_amount":235192.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":304350},{"amount":25,"local_amount":233333.33,"processed_date":"2008-10-08T01:53:37Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-29T07:08:52Z","rounded_local_amount":235192.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":351704},{"amount":50,"local_amount":466666.66,"processed_date":"2008-11-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-16T21:07:09Z","rounded_local_amount":470384.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5308475},{"amount":25,"local_amount":233333.35,"processed_date":"2008-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-22T08:56:42Z","rounded_local_amount":235192.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9925423}],"funded_date":"2008-06-09T06:14:18Z","paid_date":"2009-01-22T08:56:42Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":55627,"name":"Hellen Nakato's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Hellen N. is the leader of a group of five women.

It hasn't been easy making a living off of agriculture because sometimes there hasn't been anything to harvest. Then again, there have also been good times, when the harvest was large. Once, the family had such a good coffee crop, they were able to buy more land and even a scooter. Not only does the scooter make it easier for them to transport their crops to the market in the city, but they have also received a license to use it for public transportation. Now, when it is not needed at home, Eugenia's husband will drive the scooter as a taxi and bring in some extra income. Eugenia is a very active member of her communal bank and despite how far away from the other members she lives, she is always involved in their activities.

Experienced and talented in the business, Mahbuba has expanded her business into a successful trade, supporting her family of three chidlren. Throughout the last year, IMON International has provided assistance to Mahbuba\u2019s business through microfinance loans. Committed to growth and successful entrepreneurship, Mahbuba has used her previous loans wisely and has repaid each with a perfect credit history. Currently, she is seeking a loan of 4000 Somoni to replace depleted inventory, hoping to continue expanding her business and supporting her family.    \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and with it\u2019s famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He also rents a house in the Barreras community where he has his family: His 29 year old wife and their five children, aged 11, 9, 8, 6, and 4 years old. Eduardo has had his auto shop for many years now. It is located in the main street of the area where he also sells tires and used bearings. He buys and sells wrecked cars.  His wife is a primary school teacher in the Batavia community. There is a fair amount of competition in the market, especially because there are other auto shops, but given his seniority and the location of his shop he sees a steady stream of clients.  His wife has a steady job and earns monthly wages. Eduardo will invest the amount of the loan to purchase a plot of land in the Barreras community.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He is married and he has only one son. He has more than 50 years' experience in agriculture and farming. He started in when he was 10 years old, helping out his father to sow basic grains. His father also had a few cattle. This was the experience he managed to acquire and never in his life has he ever worked in another field of work or employment. \r\n\r\nMr. M. has recently invested more in cattle farming than in agriculture. He requests a loan to invest in his plantations to improve the infrastructure, meaning the wire fencing and to purchase grasses to supply his herd of cattle with feed. He would otherwise have to go and look for feed. His goal is to purchase a mill to make the feed for his cattle last longer and to improve productivity, especially in terms of milk production. This is an effort to improve their quality of life.

She is a cheerful and strong woman who is married to 52 year-old Nicanor.  The couple have six children though they only live with two of them: 18 year-old Madai and 7 year-old Vian.  The family lives in a rental house which is located in the central jungle (Yurinaki).  Elva has been farming since she was a young girl.  \"The land is my life\" she admits.  When she was a girl she would help to prepare the land for sowing but as a young girl she saved up enough money and, when she was 19, she bought her own plot of farm land.  Since that time, she has been growing coffee, bananas and corn.\r\n\r\nElva has a small house in the indigenous community of Centro Pumpuriani.  She travels there every weekend to care for her farm land.  When her crops are ripe, she sells them in the central market in Yurinaki.  She tells us that in the past she didn't have enough capital to hire laborers to help her harvest her ripe coffee beans and so she did the work together with her husband. \"The two of us worked hard to harvest our coffee on time\", she says.  Now that she is working with her community bank, she is able to invest capital in hiring laborers and, in this way, she can make profits in less time.\r\n\r\nIn the coming months, Elva will put together the capital she needs to buy a car.  In this way she will be able to travel to her farm land all the time.  Elva belongs to the \"Abejitas D. Pumpuriani\" (Little Bees of Pumpuriani) community bank and this is her fifth loan from MFP.  She hopes to obtain the financial support she needs to achieve her goals.  On her part, she pledges once again to make her repayments on time as she has with her previous loans.\r\n\r\nElva enjoys being a member of her community bank because all the members are responsible people and very supportive of each other.  With your support, Elva will invest the money she has requested in buying several sacks of organic fertilizer to spread over her coffee crops which she recently sowed.  She is certain that they will proviD. good beans."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":789921,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Green"],"use":"to buy several sacks of organic manure","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-06-15T16:50:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":725,"lender_count":28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elva ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-05-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":725}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":725,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:57:07Z","rounded_local_amount":2001.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238666209}],"funded_date":"2011-06-15T20:41:23Z","paid_date":"2011-11-15T10:57:07Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Oxnard","image":null}},{"id":310521,"name":"Evelyn","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Evelyn is a 55-year-old married woman.

The city of Cahul is no exception. People here spend much of their free time renovating and improving their homes or working on a new one. Cinder-block and wood structures can be seen everywhere and power tools are a common sound. Vasile understands the pride Moldovans feel for their homes and knows that proper construction requires good material inputs, so when he was thinking of going into business it was an easy choice to open a construction materials store. He located in the central market, where his goods catch the attention of many shoppers, and began by selling a number of products for construction and for the home in general. He has noticed that his construction related products sell best and that many clients ask for specific and high quality items, so Vasile has decided to specialize in things such as dry cement, tiles, plastering tools, etc. and to discontinue his stock of household detergents and other goods.

C. is a 45-year-old micro-entrepreneur living with his partner in Asunci\u00f3n, Paraguay.

The Foundation has helped them by providing the capital they need so that they may buy more merchandise. They are continuing to work hard to better their standard of living. \r\n\tInitially, Ernesto, took out a very small loan from the Foundation.

On average, they are 39 years old and have three children. They live in the neighborhood of Bozo in the city of Diamarabougou Markala (fourth administrative region of the Republic of Mali). The group members know each other through professional or family links; they are members of the same traditional association of women from Bozo, which has existed for over ten years. They have repaid without difficulty their previous four group loans and are now applying for their fifth group loan with Soro Yiriwaso.\r\n<p>\r\nThey will use this loan to buy 12 boxes of smoked fish and 800 kg of fresh fish. The fish will be sorted and then either sold fresh or fried, smoked or dried. They get their supply of smoked fish in Macina (Mignon and Diado) and of fresh fish on location in Markala on the banks of the River Niger, near the bridge, in the fishery zones of Markala and in Niono (Dora). The fish, whether fresh, fried, smoked or dried, will be sold in Bamako, at the Castle Market in S\u00e9gou and on location in Markala, for cash and seldom on credit, to a clientele made up of women and men. They have at their disposal in their backyards traditional specialized ovens and dryers to smoke and dry their fish.\r\n<p>\r\nThey expect to make an average monthly profit of 83,500 CFA francs (US$191).

She is the group leader of a 4-member group loan offered by PMPC. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nPetronilla B is married and has three adult children. To make a living, she owns and operates a general store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from selling a variety of different products in the local community. Petronilla B has been engaged in her business for over 15 years and earns approximately 1,200 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Petronilla B joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from PMPC which was used to purchase additional products to sell. Petronilla B is requesting a new loan of 2,500 PHP which will be used to purchase additional inventory and provide working capital. This will be the third loan she has taken out from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement the family's income. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in north-western Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

It proved to be a good business for her and she started getting regular orders from nearby areas and earning a good income.\r\n\r\n<p>Nazraan has applied for a loan from Kiva's partner Asasah to help her brother improve his vegetable selling business. He will utilize the loan to purchase seasonal vegetables in bulk in order to sell more vegetables and make more money. Nazraan is a very helpful and supportive person by nature.

They have a single unit (14-16 person capacity) jeepney. Melinda and her husband also manage their motor repair shop. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 2,500 every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, Melinda is requesting a PHP 25,000 loan. She will use the loan to buy new accessories and parts for the jeepney and to buy some equipment for the repair shop. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her businesses.  \r\n\r\nMelinda dreams of being able to buy another jeepney or to put up new repair shops in other places soon. She also dreams that her child will finish his\/her education. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members weekly to share stories of her work and to draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\nFootnote: Curiously, Jeepneys have purely American origins as they were first used by American soldiers to help the Philippines throw off the invading Japanese. Filipino ingenuity, however, managed to see this vehicle as an opportunity to earn income and modified the Jeep into a 20-seater jeepney. It is open enough to provide adequate ventilation, sturdy for every day travel, and cheap enough to buy and maintain. Now, jeepneys are one of the items that makes the Philippines truly Philippines.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

Raising livestock in the locality of Jasana Capallino (in the Huancane district), which she has done since she was little, is her economic activity.  She learned this business from her parents, who always wanted to give her an activity with which to take care of herself in the future.  What Teofila likes most about her job is shepherding the animals, since she enjoys the open air.

She is 48 years old. Elvira is the group leader of a 17-member group loan offered by ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nElvira is married and has 3 school-aged children. Elvira owns & operates a general store where she sells daily-use products such as shampoo, soap & toothpaste. Elvira has been engaged in her business for over 7 years and earns approximately 5,000 PHP a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Elvira joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. Elvira has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10,000 PHP from ASKI. She is requesting a new loan of 15,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the fourth loan taken out by Elvira from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated to pay her children's tuition fees.  \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fishermen and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

These loans have proven to be the driving economic force in developing countries, changing the lives of millions of ordinary people and helping them not only to accomplish their plans, but also to save tremendous amount of time. The heroes of this story are a sample from the societies of the third world:<p>\r\n\r\nS. Rysalieva is the widowed 57-year-old leader of this group.  She has raised two daughters, 40 and 25, both living and working in Russia.  S. makes her living by raising cattle and selling milk, having started the business after selling the big house her family lived in and downsizing.  During the past years, they have been able to buy a second house and now S. has a stable monthly income of $70. While this is not a large amount, considering her age she is doing quite well. Now, S. is in need of a loan to effect repairs to her kitchen. <p>\r\n\r\nS.\u2019s partners: <p>\r\n\r\nN. Israilova, a 26-year-old married mother of three children, earns her family livelihood by providing seamstress services as she manufactures national articles. Now, N. hopes to get this loan to buy a cow. <p>\r\n\r\nA. Turdugulova, 27, a divorced mother of a five-year-old son, breeds cattle and sells milk, earning around $40 per month. With this loan, she will be able to purchase sheep for breeding. <p>\r\n\r\nM. Koichukeeva, 29, married with three children, breeds cattle and sells milk with her husband, earning a stable income of $205 a month. Now M. is requesting this loan to make a house repair.<p>\r\n\r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance, a young and ambitious socially-focused MFI in Kyrgyzstan.<p>\r\n\r\nMol Bulak Finance is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development on the basis of the 3-Ps concept - People (building human capital and taking care of its customers and the society as well), Profit (to be profitable to grow further) and the Planet (taking care of the environment).

S. is a 45-year-old pepper producer who lives in the region of Coquital de Los Chiles de San Carlos, located in Northern Costa Rica. The rural zone where Valentin and his family live is one of the few places in Costa Rica without running water; the family must pump water from a nearby well as needed. Valentin is working hard towards the sustenance of his family, striving to reap the maximum benefits from his land and his labour.\r\n\r\nValentin is a dedicated farmer who plans to focus his efforts on the planting and harvest of cayenne peppers. He works in cooperation with his wife to strike a balance between accomplishing the daily tasks associated with agricultural production and the completion of domestic responsibilities. The land they work is their own. In addition to his agricultural activity, Valentin works at a local orange-processing factory as a harvesting laborer in order to supplement the family income. The money he earns helps pay bills for electricity and food. \r\n\r\nAlthough this is an individual loan, the community in which Valentin and his family live is very close-knit and interdependent. Neighbors help and support one another by sharing experiences and expertise acquired over the years. All members of the Coquital community are dedicated to the improvement of living conditions for the region as a whole.\r\n\r\nThis loan will be used to finance the production of cayenne peppers. Specifically, the loan will be used to finance the purchase of a variety of seedlings and necessary agricultural nutrients, fertilizers and chemicals in order to ensure a healthy harvest. All labor and logistical tasks associated with production will be carried out by Valentin with the help of his family members. Valentin will need roughly one year before his peppers reach maturity and are ready for harvest.\r\n\r\nPiper and Capiscum Processors Compa\u00f1\u00eda Agr\u00edcola Industrial, or PROPICA, is an international buyer and seller of chili pepper and ground pepper products. In cooperation with Fundaci\u00f3n Mujer, PROPICA has guaranteed to purchase the agricultural products (the peppers) that are to be produced with the help of this loan. PROPICA acts as a guaranteed client for small agricultural producers in the area of Coquital, thus ensuring that their products will reach market.\r\n\r\nIn general, the work day is divided into mornings and afternoons. In the mornings, the domestic tasks are carried out such as cooking and cleaning. Afternoons are generally dedicated to harvesting, planting, and working the land as needed. Valentin spends some days working as a laborer in the nearby orange-processing factory but this work is sporadic.\r\n\r\nValentin says the main factor that has stood in the way of increasing his production levels has been the Costa Rican government and various other institutions. Formal banks, lending agencies and government bodies have failed to recognize the producers of the Coquital region as legitimate producers, worthy of financial and governmental support and services.\r\n\r\nThe collaboration of Fundaci\u00f3n Mujer and PROPICA represents a unique opportunity to Valentin, his family and his community. By offering a source of start-up capital and a guaranteed client to purchase what is produced, this is a chance to improve family and community standards of living. Above all, Valentin wants to take advantage of the current opportunity that has been presented; he wants to profit from this collaboration and see improvements in his neighborhood.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":555093,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To purchase seeds and nutrients necessary for producing peppers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CR","country":"Costa Rica","town":"Coquital, San Carlos","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"10 -84","type":"point"}},"partner_id":151,"posted_date":"2010-06-16T13:30:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1050,"lender_count":41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Valentin","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-06-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"CRC","disbursal_amount":545000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":1050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":87122.68},{"due_date":"2010-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":88574.72},{"due_date":"2011-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":90050.97},{"due_date":"2011-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":91551.82},{"due_date":"2011-03-11T08:00:00Z","amount":93077.68},{"due_date":"2011-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":94622.13}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":167.85},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":170.65},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":173.49},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":176.39},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":179.32},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":182.3}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":17.82,"local_amount":9251.02,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T14:02:00Z","rounded_local_amount":9437.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177411580},{"amount":55.62,"local_amount":28870.8,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T14:09:40Z","rounded_local_amount":29452.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182551337},{"amount":37.18,"local_amount":19300.3,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-19T09:52:36Z","rounded_local_amount":19688.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":189148756},{"amount":939.38,"local_amount":487577.88,"processed_date":"2012-11-01T06:59:59Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-16T10:26:43Z","rounded_local_amount":497396.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315614314}],"funded_date":"2010-06-21T14:42:39Z","paid_date":"2012-11-16T10:26:43Z","journal_totals":{"entries":4,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jeff Avery","image":233371}},{"id":212204,"name":"Fabi\u00e1n Vicente","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Fabi\u00e1n Vicente Q.

She is a private entrepreneur who works in the central city market selling women\u2019s shoes. She offers a large variety of shoes at reasonable prices. Rano has been in business for 10 years. She has benefited a lot from 4 years of partnering with IMON International, Tajikistan. Lending services have helped her buy a new vending facility in a different part of the city, reach sustainability in her business, and have given her confidence for the future. Rano requests a loan of 5000 Somoni to re-stock her inventory and purchase shoes wholesale for the summer season. She believes that the sphere of market trade where she works is a promising niche and will continue to grow and develop in the future. \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International:\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She lives in Cauayan, Negros Occidental. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2008 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her Jeep and general store businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of 20,000. Gelyn is now borrowing PHP 29,000 for Jeep maintenance. This will be her fifth loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of 9,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom.

It is made up of 5 members, they are: Irene who will use her loan to purchase merchandise such as soap by the pound, boxes of oil, sugar in bulk, boxes of eggs, etc; Yuridia Azucena will be purchasing bags for candy, balloons, streamers, and hats; Maria will purchase paschal candles for the Easter holiday; Isabel will purchase dried peppers, guagillo and pasilla by the pound, Peruvian beans, and May flower; Irma will purchase tablecloths.  Irma is 47 years old, married, and has 3 children who are married.  Ruben is 29 years old, Brenda Mayra is 25 years old, and Ramiro is 20 years old.  Irma has a business renting out tables and chairs for parties and solicited this loan to purchase tablecloths.  She began her business 10 years ago, her husband used to make trips for a person who rented out chairs and tables and she noted that it was good business because they are materials that do not deterriorate plus she has the truck in which to transport the tables and chairs.  Her business is important because it creates earnings, is in good standing, and she gives her clients a good deal and good service.  More than anything else, Irma tries to motivate her clients by offering colored tablecloths of their choosing, waiter service with the tables, trampolines, and her youngest son helps her transport the tables.  She dreams and hopes to complete her home which still needs plastering and the bathroom needs shower heads.  She will expand her business so she can obtain money for expenses and so each one of her kids can have their own business.

She only knew that she had a business opportunity that allowed her to earn money while staying at home with her five children.  At the time, Tracey and her husband, Joe, were supporting their family with his salary as a manager at 7-Eleven and money Tracey made from her eBay business.  Not wanting to go into debt, they started with a modest budget of $145 a month to get Elegant Minerals started.  Now, five years later, Elegant Minerals offers over 300 all-natural cosmetic products to women around the world.\r\n\r\nTracey became interested in all-natural cosmetics after having her third child.  The cosmetic products she used at the time caused her skin to break out, prompting her to begin a trial-and-error period of testing countless cosmetic brands.  She says she tried everything from the most expensive brands to the cheapest without seeing improvement.  As she researched common ingredients used in cosmetics, she discovered that many brands claiming to be \u201call-natural\u201d still use synthetic ingredients that can irritate skin.  Only after switching to cosmetics with 100% all-natural ingredients did her skin improve.  Tracey reasoned that she couldn\u2019t be the only woman whose skin reacted to cosmetics with synthetic ingredients.  With this assumption, she began building the business model for Elegant Minerals.\r\n\r\nElegant Minerals sells its products to people all over the world.  Through online advertising, Elegant Minerals has become known for their affordable and quality cosmetic products.  Recently, Elegant Minerals was recognized on the Martha Stewart Living Radio as one of the best all-natural cosmetic brands.  This summer, Elegant Minerals will be featured in the independent movie \u201cLiquorice.\u201d  Elegant Minerals has donated its products to be used for the actors\u2019 makeup, and will benefit from the publicity of having their products placed in the movie. \r\n\r\nElegant Minerals has a diversified sales approach.  While Tracey estimates that roughly 80% of Elegant Minerals\u2019 sales are through their website, they also sell their products through salons, spas and independent contractors.  Tracey says that the independent contractors tend to be stay-at-home moms wanting to earn a living without sacrificing time with their kids.  Recently, Elegant Minerals reached an agreement with a large cosmetic corporation to sell Elegant Minerals products under the corporation\u2019s name and label.  Regardless of where Elegant Minerals is purchased, the price is always the same.  This diversified sales strategy provides multiple avenues for market penetration.  \r\n\r\nTracey and Joe recently built an addition to their house that will serve as their new office.

en las edades de 11 a 15 a\u00f1os y se dedica al oficio de las confecciones, actividad en el cual tiene 15 a\u00f1os de experiencia, pues desde que se cas\u00f3 decidi\u00f3 dedicarse a desarrollar un trabajo en forma independiente, que le permitiera al mismo tiempo atender su hogar y generar  ingresos para apoyar la gesti\u00f3n de su familia. As\u00ed fue como inici\u00f3 con una maquina sencilla y gradualmente ha ido incrementando su infraestructura, hasta lograr hoy tener 3 maquinarias, con las cuales produce vestidos, sudaderas, pantalones, cubre lechos y todo lo que su creatividad le inspire. Sus principales clientes est\u00e1n ubicados en la comunidad donde vive y tambi\u00e9n negocia con colegios a los cuales les confecciona uniformes deportivos. Su meta m\u00e1s adelante, es adecuar un espacio de su vivienda, para ubicar un punto comercial donde exhibir sus productos. Su mayor desaf\u00edo es contar con un surtido de todos sus dise\u00f1os y tener suficientes accesorios para adornar sus prendas de vestir, porque ante su creciente clientela, su capital de trabajo se torna insuficiente y esta es la raz\u00f3n por la cual acude a su credikiva, primer financiamiento que hace a la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, con el cual comprar\u00e1 materiales para la fabricaci\u00f3n de vestidos femeninos, sudaderas, pantalones y para la compra de una m\u00e1quina recubridora, con la cual dar\u00e1 a sus prendas un acabado perfecto. Mientras esto ocurre Luz Marina se esmera en lograr una rentabilidad no menor del  20%, que sue\u00f1a con incrementar con las inyecciones de capital de trabajo con las que ahora inicia.","en":"Luz Marina, 45, lives in the town of Soledad with her spouse and three children whose ages range from 11 to 15 years.  She is a seamstress; she has 15 years\u2019 experience since she\u2019s been working independently since she got married and she decided to work at something that produced income while leaving her free to care for her home.  This was how she started out with a simple sewing machine and has gradually been improving the infrastructure until today when she has three machines that she can use to make dresses, sweatshirts, pants, bed covers and everything else her creativity inspires. Her main clientele is located in the community where she lives and she also negotiates with schools to make their sports uniforms.\r\n\r\nHer goal for later on is to equip her home to set up a commercial sales point there to display her products.  Her greatest challenge is to have a selection of all her designs and enough accessories to decorate her articles of clothing because, in face of her growing clientele, her working capital becomes insufficient.  This is the reason why she\u2019s calling on a Kiva loan, her first financing from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo that she\u2019ll use to buy materials to make women\u2019s dresses, sweatshirts and pants and to buy an overlock sewing machine that will make perfect finishings to her items possible.

Currently, they do not have enough money to increase the inventory of their businesses.  Paz Catalina is 66 years old.  Her business is a Nintendo service.  She used to sell firewood, and over time she took her profits and purchased used clothing which she sold in her neighborhood.  Later on, she was able to purchase a three wheeled cart and eventually with the earnings she saved enough to buy the Nintendo.  When winter approaches her house floods, but this inconvenience only helps Catalina achieve her dreams of continuing to grow this business, despite the challenges.  Mayra Modesta Garc\u00eda R. is 36 years old.  She is a single mother and has one child.  She sells new and used clothes.  She came up with this business on her own initiative and realized that she quickly earned income.

She had been doing many different kinds of businesses until then just to have an income to sustain the needs of her children. Her eldest child is a college undergraduate and is presently unemployed.

She sells them directly in different municipalities of the province. At times she also sells food in the neighborhood and even in offices within the municipality where she lives. To enhance further this business, Susan applied for a loan from ASHI. The amount she borrowed is the same as her previous loan, based on her capacity to pay and the needs of her business. Presently, Susan continues saving her profit for emergency needs of her business and children.
