2 to 10. Clenie lives in the northern province of Rwanda in a place called Ruhengeli, approximately 2 hours drive from the capital city of Kigali.  Clenie is a proven businesswoman, she has had a shop selling a variety of goods since 1999.

In addition to the farm work she does, she also sells her products, thus obtaining needed profits.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from providing manicure and pedicure services in the local community. Joy has been engaged in her business for over 5 years and earns approximately 6,500 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Joy joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Joy has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to to purchase materials needed to provide service. Joy is requesting a loan of 8,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase materials needed to expand the services she provides. This loan will be the second loan taken out by Joy from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement her family's income. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 29 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas.

She likes to do so because it gives her a chance to see the whole process from start to finish.  In order to make these mattresses, you need a few of the key materials such as straw from wheat, rice and plenty of wool which she purchases in fabric stores.  She uses needles of different sizes and diameters, thread, candle wick to sew the fabric in place.  The hardest part is to obtain all of these materials when they're not in season.  This is precisely why Yeny buys as much material as possible and in bulk so that she can store it and be available whenever she needs it.<p>  Yenny's motivation are her kids so that they can finish school.

One of his children went to work in Argentina.  Another child is living independently.  \r\n\r\nHe sells sweets in a small kiosk outside of their house.  It is in Chancay, which is an hour and a half from Lima.  They have had this business for several years to pay for household expenses.  Since their household expenses have decreased with two children leaving, they want to buy more sweets to increase their earnings.  This business has required a lot of sacrifice and dedication from Antonio and his wife (together in the photo).  They work all day, but happily they are very united and persistent.  They know that together than can achieve their goals.  \r\n\r\nThis is his first loan with Midrofinanzas Prisma.  He promises to be very punctual with all of his payments.  With the loan he will buy a large quantity of sweets to improve business.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":309524,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Increase merchandise","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-04-27T15:40:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":650,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Antonio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-04-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":135.52},{"due_date":"2009-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":140.42},{"due_date":"2009-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":147.54},{"due_date":"2009-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":150.83},{"due_date":"2009-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":156.29},{"due_date":"2009-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":163.45},{"due_date":"2009-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":169.17},{"due_date":"2009-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":173.99},{"due_date":"2010-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":181.18},{"due_date":"2010-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":187.52},{"due_date":"2010-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":194.09},{"due_date":"2010-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":200}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.04},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.64},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.95},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.02},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.79},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.12},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.98},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.55},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.88},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.94},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.08},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.01}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":44.04,"local_amount":135.52,"processed_date":"2009-05-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T00:55:42Z","rounded_local_amount":136.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44596137},{"amount":45.64,"local_amount":140.42,"processed_date":"2009-06-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:41:00Z","rounded_local_amount":141.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52990403},{"amount":48.62,"local_amount":149.6,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:46:45Z","rounded_local_amount":150.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63211525},{"amount":50.26,"local_amount":154.64,"processed_date":"2009-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:30:08Z","rounded_local_amount":156.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73641032},{"amount":49.77,"local_amount":153.14,"processed_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:42:55Z","rounded_local_amount":154.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87080491},{"amount":53.19,"local_amount":163.66,"processed_date":"2009-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:18:47Z","rounded_local_amount":165.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96996650},{"amount":55.47,"local_amount":170.69,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:56:37Z","rounded_local_amount":172.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103842133},{"amount":303.01,"local_amount":932.33,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T15:24:15Z","rounded_local_amount":940.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110733796}],"funded_date":"2009-04-27T20:16:04Z","paid_date":"2010-01-15T15:24:15Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ginny Kalish"}},{"id":108570,"name":"Maendeleo 'a' Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Elfrida owns a small shop in the Nzovwe neighborhood of Mbeya.

Juvy has been engaged in her business for over seven  years and earns approximately PHP5,000 a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Juvy joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Juvy is requesting a new loan of PHP14,900 which will be used to purchase fertilizers such as manure. This loan will be the fourth loan taken out by Juvy from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao.

He works there from 7 am until 8 pm, selling beef by the pound at $2.20, pork at $2.00.  But to give a better life to his children he wants to build his house better, buying iron and cement for the construction.  In the future we wants to buy meat cutting machines for the business.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Miriam Palacio, Kiva

She is 46 years old, married and mother to seven children, whose ages range from 14 to 28 years old. Mrs. T. began her commercial activity more than six years ago. She chose it because she liked it, but also because she was anxious to procure an income which would allow her to improve her family's living conditions. Her business is very diversified, since while she sells fabric, sheets and \"thioups\" (dyed pieces of fabric), she also sells sweets and breakfasts.

A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\nIMON's History\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.

clothes. She purchases her clothing stock either in Kibuye market (Kisumu\u2019s largest open-air market) or Nairobi. She chooses the clothes she sells by looking for what her customers like. Sometimes she will see 10 customers, other days 5 and sometimes no customers come. <P>\r\n\r\nFidelite is married and has one son, age 6, named Frank. Frank says that when he grows up, he would like to be a doctor. Fidelite likes running her own business because it means she does not have to ever go begging to her husband. She likes purchasing things on her own instead of waiting for him. She hopes to use this loan to purchase more clothing stock. Her hopes for the future are to expand her business so that one day she will own her own boutique. <P>\r\n\r\nIn this video, you can hear me greet Fidelite saying \"Idhi Nade\" -- which is Luo for \"How are you?\" Fidelite responds, \"Adhi maber,\" meaning \"very good.\" Most people living in Kisumu descend from the Luo tribe, the same tribe as Obama's father. At the end, you will hear me fluctuate between Kiswahili and Luo saying \"Asante Sana\" in Kiswahili, meaning \"Thank you\" and Erokamano, which in Luo, means \"thank you.\" The voices you hear in the background are coming for a weekly K-MET borrower meeting. To see what one looks like, check out the first video in this blog post: http:\/\/fellowsblog.kiva.org\/2009\/05\/14\/m-banking\/\r\n<P>\r\n\r\nK-MET, the NGO distributing the loan, is unique in that it is not a traditional MFI. Rather, it is a development corporation focused on raising health standards in Kenya.

She owns her own home. She is a very hard-working woman, and has done various jobs since she was very young. After having her children, though, she had to shift her focus to them. Once her children were both in school, she decided to get back to work. She started selling beer, since she could do so from home and thus care for her family at the same time. Gloria places orders with beer delivery trucks, then sells the beer from her home. She tries to keep well-stocked, since this beverage is in high demand and she earns good money selling it. Sometimes, though, she doesn't have enough money to buy large quantities of beer and runs out by the time the weekend comes. \r\n\r\nGloria hopes to continue to expand her business, since it makes her feel independent and helps her provide her family with a higher quality of life. She is a long-time client of Microfinanzas PRISMA, and has always shown herself to be dedicated and responsible to her village bank. Her fellow group members are also her friends. \r\n\r\nWith this loan, Gloria will buy more beer so that her supply will last through the weekend. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by

She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be about $138 per week) to improve her business.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Kalala joined SPBD, and this is her 3rd loan with them. SPBD's loans are Kalala's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD:\r\n\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD, and since then it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.

Currently, his earnings are the only source of income for his family, so he is focusing on expanding his business in order to improve his family\u2019s financial situation. With almost 30 years of owning his own business, Magsarjalam has not only gained experience and knowledge in making quality furniture products, but he has also gained business knowledge. He is requesting a 1,000,000 MNT loan to buy more timber to make the wood used in gers and to buy furniture-making supplies for his business.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":612250,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Furniture

He has a cabinetmaking workshop there, which came out of his experience working in a carpentry shop for 10 years. For the past 5 years he has run his own business venture, building on his experience, and has made each one of his work tools little by little and bartered his furniture for the newest tools. At his business, he makes living room sets, entertainment centers, doors, and kitchen counters in his own community and in others.

Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He is married with three children. All of his children are single and school-age. Mr. Sam has worked as a local cultivator as well as a mortar maker for many years. From mortar making, he typically earns $4.50 USD per day. His wife also assists him in the same occupation. The heavy rainfall is a good sign for him to grow rice crops.

They live, together with their five children, in their own home in the community of Camunachari.  Simona is a farmer, whose parents taught her this trade when she was a very young girl.  She has been farming and raising animals for 20 years since then.  In times of the festivities, she has hens and pigs that sell quickly, due to the good breeding and diet that she provides them.  She surpasses the competition and, for this reason, she has good profits.  What she likes most about her job is buying her animals when they are very young and then watching them grow large and robust with time.  What she considers the most difficult is when the animals contract diseases as this may place the others at risk.  In the future, she hopes to buy new animals in order to increase production.  This will be her second loan with MFP; she feels that the money from the loan will help a lot with the progress of her business.

She is a woman with great desires to succeed, so she holds various jobs but the most important is selling beverages and food at the entrance of the market, something she has done for 2 years. Thanks to an opportunity that they provided her she installed her stand and has large earnings, as she is located in a very highly frequented area. Now, in the summer, people are going to the market more frequently, but to be there the greatest number of hours Lucila has to prepare her refreshments and food early in order to be in her stand and start selling at midday, to then return home very tired but content because of the work she has completed.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Rodel has been engaged in this business for over 4 years and earns approximately 3,000 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Rodel joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Rodel is requesting a loan of 5000 PHP which will be used to repair a transport vehicle used in the business. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Rodel from ASKI.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

They decided to give it that name because that is the name of the neighborhood they live in and also because they are very united women.  This story is about Mrs.Marisela L\u00f3pez Hern\u00e1ndez, who is a part of this group. She is married and has two children, a 3 year old son and a 9 year old girl. Her daughter goes to elementary school and Marisela has been selling handmade tortillas for a year. \r\n \r\nMarisela decided to start this business out of neccesity. She wasn't financially stable enough to educate her 2 children. She decided to invest the loan in purchasing more ingredients for the torilla preparation, such as: corn and firewood, which are the most indispensable things.  \r\n \r\nHer business is benefitting her a lot since with her earnings she is able to pay for her children's education. She is also saving up to invest in a locale to be able to open a tortilla shop and provide work for the people in her community.    \r\n \r\nShe wants to keep investing in the business to open her tortilla shop and she also wants to keep supporting her children so that they can keep going to school and finish their studies and have a better future. \r\n \r\nShe remarks that all of her fellow members are responsible people who make their payments. They all know each other and have no problems among themselves. She says that she is very grateful to the Kiva lenders and to FRAC, since thanks to them she is getting ahead and has been able to have her own business, and support her children's educations. \r\n\r\nThe people in the Mariposas de la Posta group and the activities they invested their loan in are:  \r\n\r\nDivina G.

She is 46 years old and the group leader of a fifteen-member group loan offered by ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is Leticia F.'s group.\r\n\r\nLeticia is married and has three adult-aged children. To make a living, she owns and operates a general store, selling a variety of different products in the local community. She has been engaged in her business for over nineteen years and earns approximately $138 a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Leticia joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 14,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. \r\n\r\nLeticia is requesting a new loan of 20,000 PHP which again will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This will be her 4th loan from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated to continue to improve her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful micro-finance institutions in the Philippines. It has 38 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3050,"image":{"id":705921,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

is a 49-year-old widow who supports her family by operating a general store.

With the help of her past 13 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Roqueta has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 14,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 11,000, uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 14th loan, she is borrowing PHP 15,000 to buy soft drinks, rice, canned goods etc for her general store so that she can continue to save up for the future expansion of her business.

He is a simple man and lives in his own house with his wife, Marlene.  They have been married for two years but had lived together for 12 years before tying the knot.  They have two children, Luis and Maycol, who they care for lovingly.  The Cayan farm lands are known for their different variety of potatoes.  There Emilio began growing potatoes eight years ago and puts into practice everthing he learned from his parents.  He plants twice a year.  The first during the rainy season when crops grow without having to be watered, and the second in the watering season when they grow any time but with irrigation.\r\n\r\nWhat he enjoys most about his work is taking care of his produce because he feels like he has done a good job each harvest time when he goes to the wholesale market in town.  He also has two young oxen (3 years old) that he uses to plow the fields.  He plows for himself and for others who pay him extras money, around S\/.60 per day.  He is now preparing to plant the \"andina\" variety and is sure he will get good results.  He belongs to the communal bank \"Coraz\u00f3n de Jes\u00fas\" and this is his second loan through MFP, where he counts on your help for his projects.  He is committed to paying back the loan on time.  The loan will be used to buy various sacks of organic fertilizer to begin planting his \"yungay\" potato.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":807028,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Green"],"use":"To buy several sacks of organic fertilizer.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-07-11T17:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":750,"lender_count":28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Emilio ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-06-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":750}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":750,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:27:46Z","rounded_local_amount":2061.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270098513}],"funded_date":"2011-07-12T07:56:23Z","paid_date":"2012-04-15T10:27:46Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sherry Bess","image":833485}},{"id":318424,"name":"Cesar Jesus","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El Sr. Cesar es un cliente antiguo, vive en la zona el Tejar vive en la casa de  su madre en la misma direcci\u00f3n tiene su taller de soldar escapes don cesar esta muy contento de  haber sido  aprobado su cr\u00e9dito El Sr. cesar esta  casado con la se\u00f1ora Noem\u00ed que tambi\u00e9n tiene su propia actividad  ella vende caf\u00e9 tiene un puesto en la misma avenida.

is divorced and has two children. Her main source of income is from a small business she runs selling sewing, quilting and embroidery supplies in one of the local markets.

Financial assistance has promoted growth in her sales and the expansion of her business. Competitive prices and top-quality merchandise have helped her gain many loyal customers. Currently, Alla has about $2,800 of working capital. Her monthly net profit amounts to $500.   \r\n\r\nAlla would like to receive a loan of $900 to increase her working capital. \tShe is planning to purchase buttons, fringe, elastic, feathers, lace and sequin trims, thread, zippers, needles and pins in bulk for further retail sale. Alla believes a wide assortment of ethnic textiles, dancewear fabrics, beads and different accessories will attract many more potential clients to her kiosk.

pesticide-selling venture. During that season, Bahodir acquired adequate income which was used to improve his home and saved for the children\u2019s education expenses. Since during the season he was diligently selling fertilizer, his land is nearly derelict. The current rainy season is an appropriate time for planting. Bahodir has taken the initiative to resume working on his land while selling fertilizer. He requires funds to purchase farm supplies such as seeds and fertilizer. Bahodir is optimistic his venture will be successful and all the effort he has expended will better the family\u2019s welfare.   \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and its famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":319840,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cafe","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To

She wants to grow to become a clothing distributor and expand her sales to a larger area.\r\n\r\nPlease help us support Carmen and the rest of this group with this Kiva loan. Thank you!\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":975,"image":{"id":328550,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"To purchase more clothes to sell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"DO","country":"Dominican Republic","town":"San Pedro de Macor\u00eds","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"19 -70.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":44,"posted_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:29Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":975,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Carmen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Blas ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rufina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Regina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Evelin","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-05-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"DOP","disbursal_amount":35000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":975,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-27T07:00:00Z","amount":2904.38},{"due_date":"2009-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":2906.61},{"due_date":"2009-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":2908.84},{"due_date":"2009-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":2911.07},{"due_date":"2009-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":2913.3},{"due_date":"2009-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":2915.54},{"due_date":"2009-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":2917.77},{"due_date":"2009-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":2920.01},{"due_date":"2009-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":2922.25},{"due_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":2924.49},{"due_date":"2009-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":2926.74},{"due_date":"2009-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":2929}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.91},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.97},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.03},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.09},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.16},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.22},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.28},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.34},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.41},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.47},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81.53},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81.59}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":291.86,"local_amount":10477.13,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T20:12:34Z","rounded_local_amount":10477.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52951040},{"amount":32.14,"local_amount":1153.77,"processed_date":"2009-07-08T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T13:03:08Z","rounded_local_amount":1153.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63168223},{"amount":81.16,"local_amount":2913.3,"processed_date":"2009-07-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T13:07:23Z","rounded_local_amount":2913.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63168224},{"amount":81.22,"local_amount":2915.54,"processed_date":"2009-08-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T14:23:57Z","rounded_local_amount":2915.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73593488},{"amount":81.28,"local_amount":2917.77,"processed_date":"2009-08-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T14:29:40Z","rounded_local_amount":2917.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73593489},{"amount":81.34,"local_amount":2920.01,"processed_date":"2009-09-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T16:02:30Z","rounded_local_amount":2920.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87028834},{"amount":81.41,"local_amount":2922.25,"processed_date":"2009-09-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T16:09:43Z","rounded_local_amount":2922.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87028835},{"amount":81.47,"local_amount":2924.49,"processed_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T16:16:52Z","rounded_local_amount":2924.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87028836},{"amount":81.53,"local_amount":2926.74,"processed_date":"2009-10-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T19:19:23Z","rounded_local_amount":2926.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96940874},{"amount":81.59,"local_amount":2929,"processed_date":"2009-10-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T19:35:22Z","rounded_local_amount":2929.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96940875}],"funded_date":"2009-06-10T01:53:14Z","paid_date":"2009-11-15T19:35:22Z","journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jeff Avery","image":233371}},{"id":116810,"name":"Maria","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Maria is 44 years old, married and has four children.

The care that she takes feeding the animals and supplying them with occasional medical visits from the veterinarian has increased their population and so now she guides them into the field each day for feeding.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nCarmelita is married and has three school-aged children. To make a living, Carmelita runs a general store, selling a variety of different products in the local community. Carmelita has been engaged in her business for over seven years and earns approximately 5,000 Philippine pesos a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Carmelita joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Carmelita has successfully repaid a previous loan of 8,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Carmelita is requesting a new loan of 9,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase new items to expand her product offering. This will be the third loan taken out by Carmelita from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\n<b>About ASKI:<\/b>\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful micro-finance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

The house is located in the La Holleria sector, one of many rural areas of the Morrope district of the Lambayeque Province, one hour from the town of Chiclayo.\r\n\r\nHe is a potter by trade, crafting clay pots and pans by request of a middle man who comes to take his products every now and then. With money he had saved he opened a general store in his home. That is where he and his wife attend their customers and offer them basic good for which they would otherwise have to travel to the central village (20 minutes away) to get. \r\n\r\nHe also has a construction job but just as with his pottery job, it is not a permanent position. Because of that, Jose strives as best he can to move ahead with his business. Currently he wishes to expand it by buying more inventory and has requested Edpyme Alternative a loan for 1,500 nuevos soles. \r\n\r\nJose has worked before with Kiva and with our bank. Thanks to his previous loan he was able to supply his general store with inventory and increase his income. He is thankful to the people who supported him the first time and wishes to keep working to accomplish his goals and move ahead. \r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Betyna Almeida-Covarrubias, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":470836,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Purchase of basic goods to expand general store","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Caser\u00edo La Holleria - C.

This is a great activity for parties, corporate gatherings or church events because so many people can participate at one time. Jason D. used this loan to buy two consoles and two generators.\r\n\r\nJason has been a serial entrepreneur since he was 11 years old when he started mowing grass for people in his community. By the time he was 18 years old, he ran a lawn care service making $600 a day, 3 days a week, \u201cYou can imagine the kind of trouble I got in\u201d, says Jason. Jason subsequently attempted to start two other businesses which did not take off. He says, \u201cI will be a serial entrepreneur until I\u2019m successful and I will keep trying. I have ideas all the time.\u201d\r\n\r\nJason started working for Perot Systems, which is now under Dell, as an analyst. He currently works for Dell and has recently had another entrepreneurial urge. He kept all of his landscaping materials so that when his three sons were old enough, they could start landscaping themselves. It was important to Jason that his sons learn a trade and he therefore created another business, Cowboy Irrigation. Every Saturday, Jason was teaching his kids how to irrigate, but they said, \u201cDad, this irrigation stuff is hard. Why can\u2019t we do something else?\u201d Jason told his children, \u201cLet\u2019s think about what you\u2019re good at, and then let\u2019s figure out a way to make money from that.\u201d Out of this discussion, Jason and his kids developed the idea for Gameboys.  \r\n\r\nJason\u2019s kids, Jack, Trent, Beau and Shealan, had invaluable input in designing the trailers. \u201cThis is me being a father and finding a way to be involved with my kids and teach them something that is productive. My purpose in life is to give them the best possible chance of being successful. I\u2019ve led by example.\u201d\r\n\r\nJason\u2019s bank referred him to ACCION Texas-Louisiana and Jason was shocked by the reasonable interest rate. Jason says, \u201cThere are a lot of people out there who have great ideas. We need people and companies that will stand behind those people\u2026. I applaud ACCION for finding avenues to trust me.\u201d\r\n\r\nJason eventually would like to build these mobile video game trailers and sell them to franchises and help them set up across the country.

Its members are Victoria, who will use the loan to buy corn and corn husks to make tamales, Aleja and Edna who will buy seasonal fruit like avocadoes, pomegranates and peaches, Minerva who will buy piglets to fatten up and Luisa who will buy flour, sugar and yeast.\r\n\r\nLuisa is 55 years old.  She completed second grade.  She\u2019s married and has 9 children, all married and independent.  She sells bread and is asking for the loan to buy flour, sugar, shortening, firewood, eggs, butter and yeast.  She offers her customers sweet bread, \u201cteleras\u201d (rolls used to make tortas) and \u201cbolillos\u201d (French rolls).\r\n\r\nShe started her business 30 years ago because of need and poverty.  She already had little children and her mother-in-law taught her how to make bread.  She used to help her make it and she stared little by little to make bread and gradually grew.  Now, she sells more.  With money earned by her husband working in the fields she bought raw materials to start the business.  Now her husband and son help her make the bread and she goes to downtown Jumiltepec to set up her sales stand to sell it.\r\n\r\nHer business is important because she gets income to cover needs and for food.  She is proud because she has many customers that buy her bread because they like the flavor of the bread they make with such joy.\r\n\r\nThe challenges she faces are the high price of ingredients.  She uses profits from the business for food, to pay back the loan and part as savings.  \r\n\r\nShe is happy with the loan that she\u2019ll get that she\u2019ll use to buy ingredients to make bread.  It will strengthen her business.  Her dreams and hopes are to stay in business making and selling bread and that her children have everything good that life has to offer.\r\n\r\nJumiltepec is a pretty town with mild temperature.  There is a lot of vegetation.  Fruits like avocadoes, peaches, pears, vines, \u2018capulines\u2019 (similar to sour cherries) abound.  Residents celebrate February 2 as \u201cOur Lady of Candlemas\u201d day.  Food is prepared for all the pilgrims who climb the hill where the Virgin of Candlemas chapel es located.
