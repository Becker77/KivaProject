Her store and Internet shop is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are neighbors and people in the local community. She earns a minimum of Php 400 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help continue the operations of her businesses, Martina is requesting a Php 20,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her store inventory, and to add a computer to her Internet shop. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nMartina hopes to be able to expand soon, as she hopes to have her own house and lot in a prominent subdivision in a nice location.

She learned to make beautiful hand-made textiles as a girl and now she operates a business making and selling them, an important source of income for her family.  She works in the comfort of her own house, an advantage because she can look after her daughter while she works.  There are times when she has to make dozens of pieces and there's so much work that she has to hire extra help.  She always stocks up on the supplies--thread, for example, and various colors of yarn--she needs for the business.

old, married with two children aged 2 and 5 and lives in Waspan Norte, in the city of Managua, Nicaragua. Her husband works as a greengrocer, selling his produce among the various districts of the city and therefore has to travel many kilometres. She has made a real effort in supporting him, now that everything is expensive and they have to provide for their children. She sells fried snacks and organises raffles, which means she has to travel around. This leaves her exhausted but by the evening, when she finishes her selling for the day, she feels satisfied. She started this business with a settlement from the previous job she had in the duty-free zone of the city. This is the first loan she requests from AFODENIC and she will use it to install a sewage system and toilet in her house, providing more hygienic living conditions for her family because at the moment, they only have a latrine that is almost full. Her plan is to also complete the building of her house, which at present is made of zinc and to improve her home, making it more secure for her family. Finally, she aims to establish a fixed place from where she can sell her fried snacks and gain more customers.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Sara Roden-Scott, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":257362,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Construction","sector":"Construction","themes":null,"use":"To buy piping in order to install a sewage system and toilet","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Managua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.150833 -86.268333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":98,"posted_date":"2009-02-01T08:00:40Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jackeline ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-15T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":6000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2009-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2009-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2009-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2009-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2009-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":54.88,"local_amount":1013.14,"processed_date":"2009-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-15T08:23:17Z","rounded_local_amount":1091.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20351587},{"amount":53.45,"local_amount":986.86,"processed_date":"2009-03-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T09:08:50Z","rounded_local_amount":1063.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27038925},{"amount":54.16,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2009-04-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T09:45:45Z","rounded_local_amount":1077.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35929220},{"amount":54.17,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2009-05-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T20:23:11Z","rounded_local_amount":1077.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44384132},{"amount":54.17,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2009-06-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T16:29:22Z","rounded_local_amount":1077.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52890594},{"amount":54.17,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2009-07-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T09:37:07Z","rounded_local_amount":1077.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63111893}],"funded_date":"2009-02-03T19:37:05Z","paid_date":"2009-08-15T09:37:07Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sara Roden-Scott","image":null}},{"id":88558,"name":"Carolina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"<p>Carolina B. is a fish vendor.

She\u2019s 55 years old; she\u2019s married and a mother of 6 children between 27 and 40. All of them have already finished their general education. However, she is still responsible for two of them and also her goddaughter who lives with her. \r\n\r\nClara lost her parents when she was a child and grew up with her grandfather on her mother\u2019s side, until he died when she was on 2nd grade. For this reason, and desperate after not having any relatives who could take care of her, she moved with a neighbor. Years later, she moves with her husband and gets pregnant with her first child, but at the same time her husband is recruited for mandatory military service for three years. So, Clara\u2019s life becomes even harder. After his arrival to Namaacha, he\u2019s assigned to work at the Vila de Namaacha and he moves with family with him.\r\n\r\nOnce there, and with the help of her husband, Clara opens her own kitchen pots business, buying products in Maputo capital and reselling them in Swaziland, their neighbor country by packages, on Thursdays and Saturdays from 5am to 6pm, at the local market where she can also exchange them for other products, spending 10,000.00MT on each trip. Her profits reach the 5,000.00MT depending on the season of the year. \r\n\r\nShe came to Hluvuku and Kiva to request for a 25,000.00MT loan to upgrade her business (purchasing more pots, that is, aluminum kitchen pots) \u2013 the Swazi community, on the South side of the African continent bears a strong tradition of using these type of pots to prepare their meals. \r\n\r\nThis is the second loan Clara receives from Hluvuku and the first one from Kiva. Her first loan was for 20,000.00 and was used to increase the stock of her products. She is confident she will repay this money before the stipulated time, and that she will be able to request for a new loan in order to build a farmyard for chicken breeding in her new house.  <br

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Burulcha raised three children.  Right now, her oldest daughter is twenty-seven years old.  She works overseas in Dubai.  The middle son is twenty-five.  He works in Kyrgyzstan and lives separately.  The youngest, twenty-one-year-old daughter lives with the older sister in Dubai.  Despite her age, Burulcha is actively involved in increasing livestock headcount, and thus can provide herself with all the necessities.   Two years ago, her daughter sent her money in the sum of six thousand som, and Burulcha was able to purchase livestock.   She liked breeding livestock so much that she fully devoted herself to this entrepreneurship.  With time, Burulcha could increase livestock headcount, having sold which, she decided to give her son a car right away.  Currently, she keeps a cow and a bull for her domestic needs and is also involved in increasing headcount of cattle.  Burulcha sees a wide spectrum of opportunities in this business because the environment in Kyrgyzstan is very conducive to breeding livestock.  This is precisely the reason why Burulcha decided to request a loan in order to purchase bulls and send them to a village, where her mother lives.  After raising livestock there for half a year, Burulcha would want to sell all of the purchased livestock and buy soft furniture for home.  Burulcha\u2019s plans also include varying her entrepreneurial activity and opening a tire vulcanization shop, where her son would work.  In the future, Burulcha also wants to build a big house for herself and her son.  For this, she is ready to sacrifice her time and effort.\r\n<p>\r\nAlong with Burulcha, this group includes Guliya, Gulnara and Myskal.\r\nGuliya is fifty-seven.  Her husband and she are retired.  Their children are grown and live separately.  Together with her husband, Guliya keep cows and have been involved in small-scale pastoral farming.  They were able to increase livestock headcount and build a house.  Guliya needs a loan in order to buy more livestock to increase headcount.\r\n<p>\r\nGulnara is a mother of five children.  Her husband is a construction worker.  Gulnara is involved in animal husbandry.  Her husband provided Gulnara with the starting capital and helped her in other ways in her new business.  Gulnara is happy with her business and requested a loan in order to purchase a cow and then sell milk.\r\n<p>\r\nMyskal is forty-five.  She is a widow and a mother of three children.  Myskal makes a living from animal husbandry.  She decided to get involved in this business on her own.  None of her children help her with the business.  Myskal decided to request a loan in order to purchase a bull, raise it and then sell it.         \r\n\r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance, a young and ambitious socially-focused MFI in Kyrgyzstan.\r\n\r\nMol Bulak Finance is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development on the basis of 3-Ps concept - People (building human capital and taking care of its customers and the society as well), Profit (to be profitable to grow further) and the Planet (taking care of the environment).

His eldest son helps out in the shop, something that gladdens Jos\u00e9 very much, since he expects his sons to inherit the business.  Jos\u00e9  requests funding so that he can buy lumber at wholesale so that he can have more products, like wardrobes, tables, etc. to offer people, the sales of which he hopes will increase his family's income so that he can offer his children the best.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva

She does her business at the new market of M\u00e9dine Sikasso. \r\nWanting to better satisfy her growing number of clients, she decided to join the microfinance institution Soro Yiriwaso over four years ago. After two group loans with an association of women from her village, she is on her second individual loan. All of her previous loans have been repaid in full.\r\nWith this loan, she plans on buying 40 cases of potatoes from the wholesale distributors who sell at the fair. She does her sales at retail, in cash and credit, to a rich and varied clientele. Dj\u00e9n\u00e8be plans on making a monthly profit of 100,000 FCFA which she will use to increase her commercial funds, contribute to her family's expenses, pay the interest on her loan, and invest the rest in her business.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Kelly Percival, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":475442,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"Purchase of Potatoes","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sikasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.316667 -5.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2010-01-24T23:30:13Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Dj\u00e9n\u00e8ba","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-01-07T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":150000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2010-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2010-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2010-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2010-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2010-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":25000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.16},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.16},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":54.17,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2010-02-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T11:18:33Z","rounded_local_amount":25161.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123991350},{"amount":54.16,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2010-03-08T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:59:49Z","rounded_local_amount":25161.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":129021625},{"amount":54.17,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2010-04-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T12:14:59Z","rounded_local_amount":25161.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136746415},{"amount":54.17,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2010-05-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T10:03:15Z","rounded_local_amount":25161.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144778951},{"amount":54.16,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2010-06-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:16:29Z","rounded_local_amount":25161.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151961163},{"amount":54.17,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2010-07-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T12:01:22Z","rounded_local_amount":25161.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159699330}],"funded_date":"2010-01-25T01:52:32Z","paid_date":"2010-08-15T12:01:22Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kelly Percival","image":null}},{"id":174996,"name":"Ny","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Ny P. is 47 years old and she lives in Chheu Teal Phluoh village in Takeo province.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nTajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She\u2019s married and has four children who are 11, 8, 7 and 4 years of age.  The oldest started secondary school this year, the next two are in elementary school and the youngest started Kindergarten this year.  Her husband is a Mechanic.  She\u2019s been in the communal bank since four cycles ago and she likes it because with the loans she\u2019s been able to help her husband with his business where she now works too.\r\n\r\nThey have an auto repair shop where they do all kinds of jobs.  They also sell spare parts: tires, lubricants, oil and other parts.  They work Monday through Saturday from 7:30am until 6pm; they have two employees.  While her husband does the mechanical work she handles the bookkeeping, purchasing and spare parts sales.  She tells us that they\u2019ve been in business 9 years and, although it was difficult at first, they\u2019ve managed to secure many customers who prefer them for their work and responsibility.  She tells us that often they have jobs to do outside the city.\r\n\r\nShe will use this loan to buy oil, spare parts, filters and tires, among other products.  Her goal is to enlarge the business.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":773565,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Vehicle Repairs","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to buy lubricants, spare parts, filters, tires, etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Portoviejo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2011-06-04T02:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":675,"lender_count":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Yina Mar\u00eda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-05-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":660,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2011-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2011-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2011-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2011-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2011-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2011-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2011-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2011-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2011-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2011-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":55}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":110,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:05:04Z","rounded_local_amount":112.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216504170},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":110,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:48:04Z","rounded_local_amount":112.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221668114},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":110,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T09:09:02Z","rounded_local_amount":112.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227036863},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":110,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:02:33Z","rounded_local_amount":112.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232797426},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":110,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:14:57Z","rounded_local_amount":112.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238608535},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":110,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:53:45Z","rounded_local_amount":112.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244562884}],"funded_date":"2011-06-04T07:56:18Z","paid_date":"2011-12-15T09:53:45Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":306568,"name":"Heom","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Heom, 48 years old, is a humble father who has five children.

Her common-law husband, Cesar, is a farmer and they have four beautiful children, ages 22, 21, 20 and 14, who they love very much.  They live comfortably in their own home.  Quelita sells groceries out of a store set up in her house.  Here she attends to her customers, the majority of whom are neighbors.  She started the business to make extra income and has been in it now for six years.  With the help of a loan and her own savings she was able to set up the store and over time has grown and attraced many customers.\r\n\r\nShe enjoys her work because it allows her to be at home and have an income while also having free time for other activities and housework.  What she does not like so much is when customers ask for credit for their purchases since she has had several bad experiences.  So now she sells everything on a cash basis which gives her better results.  \r\n\r\nShe plans to continue growing and expanding the business.  This is her second loan through MFP and she is grateful for the financial support so she can carry out her plans.

Every day she takes care of the piglets. The food mixtures that she gave to the pig consist of fine rice chaff, concentrate, and mineral so that the milk quality is good. After 2 months, the piglets can be sold for Rp. 250,000 (about  $27) per piglet so she can earn Rp. 2,500,000 (about $276).

Although she has recently remarried, she remembers the hardships she experienced as a single mother and wishes to secure a future for her family.\n\nAfter Amancia\u2019s first husband passed away she provided for her children by selling clothing in Puerto Plata.  Amancia says that she used to buy clothes at a discount from a warehouse in Santiago and then sell individual items of clothing in her neighborhood.   Now, she hopes to use Esperanza to help her to start selling clothes again.  Amancia believes that with the help of Esperanza she will be able to make her business a success.  She says that Esperanza\u2019s loan will allow her to obtain an additional discount from the warehouse because she will be able to buy in bulk.\n\nAmancia\u2019s hope is to spend the income from her clothing sales to provide her children with a good education.  She says that she wants to help her children to learn English and dreams that she will be able to send them all to college.  Amancia is particularly interested in helping her youngest son Rafael to pursue an artistic career.

The older child is working while the younger one is still a student.  \r\n<p>\r\nSr. David has managed to buy most of the machinery for his welding business, which helps make his job easier.  This will be his ninth loan with AFODENIC.  He is thankful for the financial support that helped him acquire his machinery.  With his current loan, he plans to buy welding materials so that he can provide good service and follow-up to his customers.

She gets her supplies locally from wholesalers, and she sells generally for cash and on credit to a customer base made up of women.\r\n\r\nShe is expecting to make a monthly profit of 250,000 FCFA which will be used essentially to expand her business, contribute to family expenses and pay the interest on her loan; the rest will be invested in her activity.   \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Alison Le Bras, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":512181,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Tailoring","sector":"Services","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"Purchase of sheets, curtains and tablemats","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sikasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.316667 -5.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2010-03-24T15:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1050,"lender_count":40,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ramatoulaye","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-11T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2010-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2010-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2010-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2010-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2010-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":175,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2010-04-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T12:15:04Z","rounded_local_amount":84696.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136746578},{"amount":175,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2010-05-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T10:03:20Z","rounded_local_amount":84696.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144779127},{"amount":175,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:16:39Z","rounded_local_amount":84696.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151961327},{"amount":175,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T12:01:49Z","rounded_local_amount":84696.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159699445},{"amount":175,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:58:27Z","rounded_local_amount":84696.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166913364},{"amount":175,"local_amount":83333.35,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:40:57Z","rounded_local_amount":84696.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172180534}],"funded_date":"2010-03-24T20:18:50Z","paid_date":"2010-10-15T10:40:57Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Alison Le Bras","image":608879}},{"id":191849,"name":"Mohammed","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mohammad is the father of a nine-year-old daughter and a six-year-old son.\r\n\r\nMohamamd is an employee of the Palestinian National Authority but his salary barely covers basic family needs.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

This school was founded in 1947 by the Ahmadiyya Mission. Currently the school is staffed with fourteen teachers and has an enrollment of 400 pupils.    \r\n\r\nThese hard-working and dedicated teachers have come to SMT, a partner of Kiva.org, to seek a loan of SLL 8,750,000. With the help of this loan, these teachers can embark on some meaningful project that their mere salaries alone cannot do. Some of them will use the loan to buy pieces of furniture, others to buy house-building materials, some a piece of land, pay school fees for their children, while some of them will invest the loan in business. \r\n\r\nAlice V.

is married and lives in Himamaylan City, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by running three small businesses: aquaculture, tailoring and raising livestock. Her husband, Hernanie E., who is 60 years old, works as a laborer. They have four children who range in age from 26 to 34. Virginia joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2001 because wanted a better life for her family. With the help of her 14 previous loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Virginia has been achieving this goal. Her most recent loan of PHP 12,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 5,000 and meant improvements to her family's life. She is applying for a new loan, her 15th, for PHP 13,000, which she intends to use to expand her aquaculture business and thereby help pay for her children's education and for home repairs. Virginia is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through its poverty alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She operates 2 business ventures:  abaca weaving and a general store. Her husband, Ronelo, who is 48 years old, works as a farmer and also helps in his wife's business activities. They have 4 children aged between 16 and 25.\r\n\r\nAnnabelle joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2005 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 10 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Annabelle has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 15,500 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 6,000, lifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her 11th loan, she is borrowing PHP 17,000, which she intends to use as additional capital for her abaca weaving business. In that way she can continue to save up for the future education of her children and home repairs. Annabelle is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Lecilda is requesting a new loan of 20,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional bread, flour, milk, and coffee. This loan will be the sixth loan taken out by Lecilda from HSPFI.

They live in traditional families.  Their average age is 29 and they have an average of at least 3 children.  They cultivate peanuts.  With the goal of making their agricultural business profitable, the group members decided to join the Soro Yiriwaso loan program three years ago.  After fully repaying their prior loans, they are on their third loan. The current loan for ADA, who is the president of the group and the first person standing on the left with the blue scarf, will be used to buy peanut seeds, small equipment, and inputs for cultivation, at the main market in SAN.  After the rainy season, the harvest is stored for a certain time so that it has value, before being sold at the main market of SAN and at other nearby markets, at retail (often at wholesale), in cash, to customers who usually come from large cities.  The members of the group expect to each make, after the distribution and sale of their agricultural products, a profit of 17000 to 70000 FCFA, which will be used to pay the interest on the loan and household expenses.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":790744,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"to purchase inputs, seeds, and small equipment.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Djalakoro","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:12Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":675,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ada ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Awa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Djeneba ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Awa Ousmane ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Foune","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Aissata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-05-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":300000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":300000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":675}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":675,"local_amount":300000,"processed_date":"2012-01-14T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:48:09Z","rounded_local_amount":308600.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257283067}],"funded_date":"2011-07-07T02:54:06Z","paid_date":"2012-02-15T11:48:09Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Frances Hsieh","image":668928}},{"id":310681,"name":"Fatuma","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Fatuma is a divorced woman with five children, all of whom attend school.

When Yasser gets the loan, which is repaid on a monthly basis, he will be able to purchase more stock so he will have a better selection of goods for sale which will enable him to compete and increase his income. He will also improve his store by purchasing more shelves and enhancing store lighting.Yasser is photographed in his store. \r\n\r\n\r\nAbout this loan product:\r\n FATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

When she was a child she used to put her parents' cows out to pasture as they had large quantities of them and since she married she has worked in agriculture as her husband works in this.  Now they grow 3 to 4 hectares of potato, she says it is profitable for them,  above all when the market becomes scarce. She recently took them to sell and once that harvest can be stored, it lasts her 3 to 4 months and meanwhile she lives from the sale of her cows and when the price of potato increases she takes it to market. Cultivating her lands makes her happy, but it becomes difficult when she has to fertilize and medicate her lands.  This is her 7th loan with MFP, during this time she has demonstrated punctuality in her payments.  With this money she will buy fertilizers with nitrate, urea and 18 so that in this way her potato crops react well.

He is a humble farmer dedicated to growing vegetables and raising his two sheep on his land. To do this work, he has to leave early in the morning and go back home late. But when he sees the results, it comforts him. He wants to increase his production because he knows that he will have better results from a larger harvest.  The vegetables will also need to be of better quality in order to get more income from the sales. In order to do all this, he needs to invest large amounts of money.  He wants to increase his vegetable production and purchase more sheep to breed. That is why he applied to IMON International for a loan of 10500 Somoni.  \r\n \r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is also receiving regular support from her husband from his salary. She\u2019s been engaged in this kind of business for almost a year already and earns approximately PHP 1,500 a month from this business activity.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Delia joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Delia, as a newly recognized member of PMPC under the Regular Loan Program, is requesting a loan of PHP 15,000 as her first loan. She will use the loan as additional capital for her newly opened sari-sari store. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of their family, especially in meeting their basic needs, saving for future use, loan repayments, child\u2019s education, insurance and possible business expansion. \r\n\t\t\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n Paglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao.

It is composed of nine members. The women will meet every 28 days over the course of  six months to empower one another and make their payments. The members thought over this payment plan and are confident that they are familiar with it and will be punctual. The board of directors is composed of Veronica as president, Rosa as treasurer, and Judith as secretary. \r\n\r\nVeronica is a young woman of 27 years. She is married and the mother of three. As president of the association, she has the task of making sure the board of directors, group leaders, and members follow the terms agreed upon at the start of the loan cycle. This is a good challenge for her, because Veronica has been with the association for only one loan cycle. She joined the association thanks to a woman\u2019s invitation. \r\n\r\nHer business is selling clothing. Her sister taught her how four years ago. Her first loan was for 1000 bolivianos, and this loan cycle she has requested 2000 bolivianos. In both cases, the money goes towards the purchase of merchandise. The rest of the members of the association have businesses where they carry out vegetable sales, clothes washing, machine knitting, clothing sales, blanket weaving, the sale of various articles, and purchase and sales of leather.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2050,"image":{"id":623498,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"To purchase clothing","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"La Paz  \/ El Alto","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.483333 -68.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":59,"posted_date":"2010-10-26T01:20:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2050,"lender_count":75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Veronica","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lucia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Victoria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Elena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ortencia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Judith Ester","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Filomena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hilaria Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-10-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":14141.4,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":2050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":2357.02},{"due_date":"2010-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":2357.02},{"due_date":"2011-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":2357.02},{"due_date":"2011-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":2357.02},{"due_date":"2011-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":2357.02},{"due_date":"2011-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":2356.3}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":341.68},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":341.69},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":341.68},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":341.69},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":341.68},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":341.58}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":341.68,"local_amount":2357.02,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:33:04Z","rounded_local_amount":2381.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182607979},{"amount":683.37,"local_amount":4714.04,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T14:35:24Z","rounded_local_amount":4763.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188747039},{"amount":341.69,"local_amount":2357.02,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T12:16:08Z","rounded_local_amount":2381.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195912067},{"amount":341.68,"local_amount":2357.02,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-22T08:14:38Z","rounded_local_amount":2381.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":202161029},{"amount":341.58,"local_amount":2356.3,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:46:11Z","rounded_local_amount":2380.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206221180}],"funded_date":"2010-10-27T12:31:15Z","paid_date":"2011-05-15T11:46:11Z","journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":245134,"name":"Mussarat's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mussarat has applied for a loan from Kiva partner Asasah for the expansion of her husband\u2019s business selling plastic beans (which are used in making plastic bags).

is a 38-year-old married woman who supports her family by operating a sari-sari store and a fishing business. She lives in Himamaylan City, Negros Occidental. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 1990 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her two businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 15,000. Sisa is borrowing PHP 19,000 in order to purchase more inventory to sell. This will be her 13th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 19,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Sisa hopes to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the  Dungganon way. \r\n\r\n<p>About NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

He lives with his family in Shahrituz, Tajikistan. Zulfikor sells good quality bedclothes and carpets in the central city market. His vending kiosk is well known in the market for a wide assortment of goods at affordable prices. \r\n\r\nZulfikor started his venture nine years ago. He is hoping to expand his assortment of goods and is requesting a loan of 10,000 Somoni. His perfect credit history with IMON International proves his integrity and capacity to repay the current loan. We believe Zulfikor\u2019s ability to transform his business into what he wants it to be and make profit in the process will lead him to ultimate success in the venture.  \r\n  \r\n        \r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The congenial and go-getter father of four says hard work has always played first fiddle as he goes about his 16-year-old restaurant business trivial round in the metropolis of Mityana in central Uganda, in East Africa. There is a discernable beehive of activity at his restaurant business.  He set forth in this business with savings from his farming enterprise a few years back. He still plies his farming business and he says it helps him to reduce the deficiencies from his restaurant business income.\r\n\r\nThe fact that James is a risk tolerant entrepreneur has also been one of his strongest stocks in trade. He, however, says he has lots of leeway to make up to reach a fully satisfactory rate of growth in his business. Needless to say, the farming business has come in handy as he is able to harvest crops and use them at his restaurant. He grows and harvests staple foods like bananas, cassava, beans, rice, beans, etc. This helps cut down on the costs of purchasing food, especially with the current status quo where food prices are soaring every day.  For James' group, this will be the fourth loan. The records show a good repayment pedigree. Weekly, James says, his gross sales income totals up to Ugandan shillings 50,000.

Having served in the veterinary heath centre of Adidogom\u00e9, he mastered veterinary treatments. Today, breeding in Togo remains undeveloped and submitted to the native selection. To that fact, the need for animal protein is a crucial problem which he is passionate about.

As a good manager, he has successfully managed his first credit of $ 850 with honesty and rigour, which increased his credibility.\r\n\r\nMr Agb\u00e9ko K.

To support her family, Ingrid owns and works in a small shop selling clothing, shoes and perfume.  She struggles with being able to pay the bills because her customers purchase items on credit and then don\u00b4t pay her back.  She then has to track them down and get the money from them, but sometimes they don\u00b4t have enough.  Because of this, Ingrid has to take out loans and stay in debt.  <p>Ingrid has had one loan with Esperanza International and successfully paid it back.

History of note includes: it was once a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; the birthplace of the great Persian poet Rudaki; and the birthplace of the most famous Islamic philosopher Ibn Sina (Avicenna). The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p> \r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n<p>\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients have a viable business proposition when they request a loan. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and IMON will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Two of the children are studying in elementary level while the youngest is just a seven-month-old baby. \r\n\r\nJennifer started her snack vending business when she got married while her husband has been operating their passenger tricycle, which serves as their source of income. Sometimes, they use their tricycle as their service in vending and they are gaining a net average income of 300 pesos daily. Their income is not enough to sustain the family with their daily needs and to maintain their tricycle business. For this, she is hoping to avail a loan of PHP 5,000 ($US 125) to be used in purchasing more products to sell and to be able to have a greater income for the future use of their children in school and in their home necessities. The loan will be of big help also for the maintenance of their tricycle transport business. She is happy that her husband is always supporting her by accompanying her in selling. She hopes that with the sacrifices she makes, together with her husband and with the help of our God, they could be able to support the studies of their children and meet the daily expenditures of their family. Jennifer aims for a better living and she believes that by working hard and having patience in work, her goals will be possible to attain.

For this, she pays them a percentage of her earnings and she generates income from various locations at the market.  She visits each post very early in the morning to deliver her products, and later collects her profits.  Additionally, she sells her wares on weekends at the different markets in her area walking from 9 am until 6 pm.  However, this sacrifice has its reward in the income she earns with her sales.  Kelly\u2019s wish for the future is to have a set site where she can sell her clothes more easily and comfortably.  This is the 13th credit with Microfinanzas PRISMA and what she most appreciates about her cooperative bank is the teamwork she has with the other members.  Buying clothes during these months is very beneficial given that it\u2019s winter, therefore the demand for warm clothing goes up and the 1,500 soles she requests will help her buy more merchandise.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Mary Lynn Malaby, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":350829,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"To increase her merchandise.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-07-13T11:00:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":500,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kelly","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":162.83},{"due_date":"2009-08-31T07:00:00Z","amount":163.78},{"due_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":175.24},{"due_date":"2009-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":183.12},{"due_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":190.11},{"due_date":"2009-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":199.92},{"due_date":"2010-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":208.26},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":216.74}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.28},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.59},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.41},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":61.04},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.37},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.64},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":69.42},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":54.28,"local_amount":162.83,"processed_date":"2009-07-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:46:18Z","rounded_local_amount":165.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63211991},{"amount":54.59,"local_amount":163.78,"processed_date":"2009-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:29:29Z","rounded_local_amount":166.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73641521},{"amount":58.41,"local_amount":175.24,"processed_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:43:15Z","rounded_local_amount":177.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87080961},{"amount":61.04,"local_amount":183.12,"processed_date":"2009-10-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:16:59Z","rounded_local_amount":185.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96997102},{"amount":63.37,"local_amount":190.11,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:56:31Z","rounded_local_amount":192.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103842457},{"amount":208.31,"local_amount":624.92,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T21:07:14Z","rounded_local_amount":634.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734021}],"funded_date":"2009-07-13T17:10:50Z","paid_date":"2010-01-15T21:07:14Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":125470,"name":"Svetlana","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"<p>Svetlana is married with one grown up son.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She works with one aim in mind, to provide the best possible example and way of life for her beloved children who are all the apple of her eye and the reason for her daily efforts. With this opportunity and with the immense love she feels as a mother and her desire to succeed, she is appealing to your generosity and is requesting a loan of 5000 Somoni in order to increase the range of her goods.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.<P>\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.<P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Hace m\u00e1s de 30 a\u00f1os se dedica a la actividad agr\u00edcola, vale decir, al cultivo de cacao y caf\u00e9.

Hoy a sus 47 a\u00f1os, considera que ha cumplido su meta de ser uno de los lideres en su comunidad, esto gracias al esfuerzo constante, sin embargo no quiere conformarse, por lo que tiene pensado ampliar su mercado en otras zonas estrat\u00e9gicas, comprando amplios terrenos de cultivo, con la finalidad de minimizar costo y tiempo a la hora de trasladar y vender sus productos a los centros de acopio de su misma comunidad.

He lives with his his partner and has one child under his care. He lives in the community of Palestina, located in the beautiful Cuzco rainforest, where he has his own house. He has been working in agriculture for more than 30 years, growing cacao and coffee. The reason why he entered into this area is that he saw that the vast majority of his competitors didn't produce their agricultural products on a large scale. In addition, the wholesalers who stockpiled the coffee and cacao didn't acknowledge the financial worth of the products. That is why Francisco wants to produce in quantity and in quality, with the goal of selling at a fair price. Today, at 47, he considers himself to have reached one of his goals of becoming a community leader thanks to his constant efforts. Nonetheless, he does not want to rest. That is why he has plans to increase his market in other strategic areas, buying large crop areas. The idea is to minimize cost and time when it comes time to transport and sell his products in the warehouses in the community. This is his third loan with MFP and he is committed to complying with his payment schedule. In addition, he feels supported by his community group because of the committment and responsibility he has with it. With the loan he is asking for he will buy materials and fertilizers to improve his cacao and coffee crops. This way, he can avoid the diseases that affect his crops. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ellen Donohue, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":538894,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy fertilizer to protect his cacao and coffee crops.

Meet Caroline (pictured above) from Kakiptui, Kericho area of Kenya, an area that is very fertile. Caroline is 41 years old and a proud mother of 3 angelic-looking children whom she really adores and cherishes. In addition to doing some small business, Caroline is a very hardworking farmer. She has been farming for the past five years. She has gained so much experience through those years of farming. Caroline practices mixed farming. That is, she grows maize and also keeps dairy cows. Through these activities she has been able to earn a decent and honest income. Because of the passion she has for farming, she has even nicknamed one of her cows. She really enjoys taking care of her cows. Although Caroline has been making profits through farming, not everything has been easy for this humble and industrious mum. Her farm has not been producing as much of a harvest lately because of the lack of fertilizer and good seeds, and the presence of pests and diseases. That is why she is seeking a loan to buy farm implements and seeds, so as to expand her horticulture farm. Through the loan, Caroline will be assured of a bumper harvest and this will translate into more profits and cash. Through the use of good seeds and fertilizer, she will increase her profit margins. Using this loan, Caroline will be able to expand her horticulture business. She sees a lot of room for improvement and growth. What is lacking is the capital to drive the positive change.

She earns her living by direct selling personal  & specialty products and RTW (Ready-to-Wear) Clothes.\r\n\r\nMilagros and her husband Danilo have 3 children who are between 25 and 33 years old. Two children are already established with their own families. Milagros is quite proud that one of her children now works as a bookkeeper in the Toledo Branch of NWTF-Project Dunggganon in the island of Cebu.\r\n\r\nMilaros joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1981 in the hope that she would be able to help her husband improve the quality of life of their family. With the help of her loans from NWTF-PD she has been able to increase their family income by engaging in direct selling activities and RTW. Now she earns an average monthly income of Php 8,000 from her business activities.\r\n\r\nMilagros is a member of good standing. Her previous loan of Php 15,000 was used to fund operations of her direct selling and RTW, and it had a positive impact in both the business and the family\u2019s living conditions. Now she is borrowing her 7th loan for the amount of Php 17,000, which she intends to use on direct selling and RTW. Milagros is working hard to achieve her dreams and aspirations for her family, which is to provide them with a brighter future and a more comfortable life.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress out of earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":475180,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Goods

M. Junior, has been operating a goat selling business from I., Ibanda for over four years.  He started up with a small amount of capital from his still existing farming business. \r\n\r\nM. Junior buys goats from the surrounding villages which he slaughters and gets ready for selling to his genuine customers who have supported him this long.  His business has grown to the extent that he has been able to have his children go to school. In a month, Junior says that he makes 160,000 Ugandan shillings.

The number of motorcycles is increasing in the region, so Muhammad came to FATEN to take out a loan to purchase new tools and necessary parts. Muhammad's workshop is one of the very rare ones in Jabalia. He has a good number of clients and would like to increase them by providing better services. Muhammad appears in the picture here in his workshop.\r\n\r\n<u>Important information about this loan:<\/u>\r\nFATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the culturA. context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principA. loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

She earns her living by operating two businesses, a cafeteria and a sari-sari (general) store. Her husband, Eugene, who is 53 years old, buys and sells fish to earn his living and also helps in his wife's business activities. They have no children. Joe Ann joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2008 because she aspired after something better for her family. With the help of her past five loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Joe Ann has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 11,000 PHP helped her earn a monthly profit of 12,000 PHP, uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her sixth loan, she is borrowing 13,000 PHP, which she intends to use as additional capital for their business so that she can continue to save up for future house improvements. Joe Ann is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

Sonia and her partner are the mainstay of their family. From very early on in her childhood Sonia's parents instilled in her the value of working the fields. She has her own plot where she has been growing coffee plants and coca leaves. She has been working her own land for ten years. During harvest season she hires day laborers to extract the beans and thus proceeds more quickly with the harvest. \r\n\r\nThe thing she enjoys most about her work is collecting the beans from the plants as she feels then that the months of arduous work are rewarded by the quality of the beans. She believes that the most difficult aspect is transporting her products from the field to the collection centers located in the city of San Francisco [Peru], a place where better prices are to be had for her beans and coca leaves. The difficulty she has is not having enough income to cover advance payments to the workers who help her with the harvesting. Thus she turns to loans provided by the institution MFP.
