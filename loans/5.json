The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.

He has been a hard-working boy from childhood when he got a job. This job was very short since he was sacked from the job without any fault of his. He also lost his brother who usually supported him in paying school fees and the basic needs of the family. With these drawbacks in life, poverty set in as he now was really unable to maintain the living standards of the family. He then moved to a little two-room house. The school for the children was changed which made them trek very long distances as they even became sick and expenses grew. Faced with these difficulties, his luck changed when his friend introduced him to GHAPE in 2008 were he got his first loan of 400,000 frs which he finished  paying back. He is now asking for a loan which he will use to purchase newspapers, firewood, and piglets.<P>\r\n\r\nHe knows the business will succeed since his community is in need of firewood for cooking and also the pigs will provide pork and  the  pig manure will be used to improve land to farm food crops and vegetables to the community. <P>\r\n\r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon.

Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement.

For socio-economic reasons, she left school after the 7th grade, Malian education system, to get married. She began earning her living together with her older sister who was very good at selling various goods. She worked for several years with her sister who would give her little things to re-sell when she came back from her business trips to Lom\u00e9, Accra, Abidjan, etc. After these years of learning to the business,  Diaminatou opted for selling clothing, handbags, and shoes, which she has been doing for 4 years.

S., 42, aims to go against the common notion of mediocrity with regard to her business.  She is separated from her husband and thus works hard to earn a living for herself and her child. She and her child live in Maricaban, Pasay City.\r\n\r\nRunning a sari-sari (variety) store is Marelin's occupation. She has run this small-scale business for two years. She adapts well to the trends in her neighborhood when it comes to popular brands of food, shampoo, and drinks.  She also sells some children's toys, accessories, and kitchen merchandise.  Because of her expertise in this field, she earns at least Php10,000 monthly.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operation of her business, she would like to request a Php14,000 loan. She intends to use this loan to buy more quality merchandise to sell. She knows that having a lot of stock will attract more customers to her store.\r\n\r\nMarelin is doing everything she can in order to see her business grow and expand. She wants to become successful in life, be it in her family life or in her business.  She prays for good health and a happy life.\r\n\r\nAs a CCT community partner, she faithfully attends the group's weekly fellowship* meeting where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she receives.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance

This is 28-year-old Diana M. from Dar es Salaam. She is married with one child who is three years old. Additionally, she is responsible for supporting two dependants who depend on her because they are orphans. Diana has been running a cafe business since 2005. A local restaurant or caf\u00e9 in Tanzania usually consists of a rough wooden table and some long, wooden benches. The food is all local: rice, <em>ugali<\/em> (a hot sticky dough, made from maize flour), and plantain (a cooked savory banana) all served with beans, vegetables, meat, and a variety of sauces. She works at the business for 9-12 hours per day, 7 days per week. Asha currently earns about 200 USD from her business. She is requesting a loan of 525 USD in order to purchase wheat and maize flour, cooking oil, and rice.  In the future, she plans to expand her business. Diana thanks you for your support.\r\n\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":388844,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Shoe Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To purchase shoes in bulk ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbozi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.75 32.75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-09-16T19:40:17Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":475,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elizabeth ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":600000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2010-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2010-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.16},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.16},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":79.17,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-10-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T06:32:15Z","rounded_local_amount":103233.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97023062},{"amount":79.16,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:44:43Z","rounded_local_amount":103233.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103868303},{"amount":79.17,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-12-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T16:46:54Z","rounded_local_amount":103233.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110757499},{"amount":79.17,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2010-01-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:34:48Z","rounded_local_amount":103233.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118146593},{"amount":79.16,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T11:16:24Z","rounded_local_amount":103233.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123984738},{"amount":79.17,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2010-03-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-10T13:02:11Z","rounded_local_amount":103233.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":129015411}],"funded_date":"2009-09-17T00:59:33Z","paid_date":"2010-12-10T13:02:11Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Diane Bird","image":220084}},{"id":141317,"name":"God Is Wonderful Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This is a group of five borrowers led by Jartu R., 48 years old.

His wife stays at home, but is currently training to be a hairdresser. She wants to open a salon so that she can supplement her husband\u2019s income. Dilshod sells hay for animals at his house and at the market. He buys them  wholesale from local farmers. Having worked in this business for 10 years already, he is a well-known seller of hay in his village and has many clients who buy hay from his house. The price he charges for hay is based on the quantity that his customer buys. Dilshod also offers a discount to his frequent buyers who come to him often. With a loan from IMON International, Dilshod plans to increase his stock in order to fully meet the demand of his growing customers. He says that the demand is there and his problem is being able to supply enough hay. The well being of this young family is in your hands.\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International:\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists, and poets, such as: Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New Western culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He earns his income selling the milk and tea produced on his farm, and from running his butcher shop in town. He is able to employ three people in the community. He says that lately the main challenges to his business are lack of clean water, insufficient feed for his livestock and poor marketing and pricing for milk.\r\n\r\nErick has a successful history with Juhudi Kilimo, previously completing a loan of 40,000 KES. He has now requested this loan for 50,000 KES to purchase a dairy cow (40,000) and to expand his butchery business (10,000). He says that with the added income he'll earn he can repay the loan and also care for his family's needs.\r\n\r\nIn the future, he hopes to improve his cows to pedigree level, producing 30 liters per day, and to add to his land.

They are three young women who want to advance.\r\n\r\nMargarita, the coordinator of the group, sells personal accessories such as cosmetics, clothing, shoes, perfumes, and other items. She began this business six years ago, selling only clothing. Then she decided to also sell perfumes, and thus, little by little, she introduced more products. Ana Maria makes door-to-door sales of perfume and other catalog accessories, especially Avon and Zermat products. Her mother began the business, but when she was not able to dedicate the necessary time to it, Ana Maria took over. Finally, Br\u00edgida, the youngest of the group, has barely one year of working in catalog sales of Avon products. Her wish is to be more self-supporting and to also work with other businesses such as Zermat, Oriflame, and Jaquelin Carol.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Pam McMurry, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":586388,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Products Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Buy products to sell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Managua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.150833 -86.268333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":120,"posted_date":"2010-08-20T14:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":700,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Margarita Del Carmen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ana Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Brigida De La Concepcion","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-08-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":15000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1875},{"due_date":"2010-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1875},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1875},{"due_date":"2010-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1875},{"due_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","amount":1875},{"due_date":"2010-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":1875},{"due_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":1875},{"due_date":"2010-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":1875}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":203.12,"local_amount":4352.58,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T09:21:56Z","rounded_local_amount":4364.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172038142},{"amount":194.84,"local_amount":4175.07,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T11:59:46Z","rounded_local_amount":4186.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177328986},{"amount":127.04,"local_amount":2722.35,"processed_date":"2010-11-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T11:37:28Z","rounded_local_amount":2729.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182464074},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":1875,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T11:38:00Z","rounded_local_amount":1879.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182464075},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":1875,"processed_date":"2010-12-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-19T09:08:16Z","rounded_local_amount":1879.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":189096458}],"funded_date":"2010-08-21T18:57:33Z","paid_date":"2011-01-19T09:08:17Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Pam McMurry","image":null}},{"id":228151,"name":"Lenin Antonio","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El  Sr. Lenin Antonio M.

She is married to Juanito C.. They are blessed in their marriage to have good health and healthy physiques, which enables them to provide for themselves and their families.\r\n\r\nIrenea operates a food stall. In the Philippines, the whole working community and most of the families only eat home-cooked meals during evenings where all of the family members are at home to take part of the meal. This is not only a usual family tradition, but a matter of convenience and frugal living. It is considered a waste of money and time to spend cooking gas and food for one to two persons, when buying cooked rice and viands (prepared dishes) costs less than raw food. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of 250 Philippine pesos (Php) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php8,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy more quantities of products like meats, rice, vegetables, condiments and seasonings. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n \r\nIrenea hopes to have her house renovated by the end of the year.

K. was born in the village of Kozhoke (in the Osh area of the Kirghiz Republic). She is 42 years old. Nazira and her spouse are raising three remarkable children. Nazira was born into a simple family in which she was the eldest; therefore, she had many chores: looking after younger brothers and sisters, doing housework, and helping on the farm. As a child, Nazira dreamed of becoming a pediatrician, but, alas, life forced her onto another path.  However, today she says her daughter will absolutely become a doctor.  \r\n\r\nWhen she was eighteen, Nazira got married.  By Kirghiz tradition, newly-married couples live in the parents\u2019 house, and Nazira\u2019s husband was a younger son.  Nazira\u2019s husband worked hard on a collective farm; she worked taking care of the family\u2019s livestock, and by then they already had two children. Unfortunately, the 400-square-meter plot of land allocated to each family was not sufficient to plant enough crops to turn a profit.  \r\n\r\nIn 2001, after her parents\u2019 funeral, Nazira\u2019s family moved to the Chuysky valley, into the village of Alekseyevka. Here the couple bought a house with a vegetable garden and bought two milk cows. Income from delivering milk and selling vegetables became Nazira\u2019s family\u2019s livelihood.  Ten years have passed since then, and the family has endured many trials, but thanks to persistence and diligence they are no longer in grave financial condition. Today, on their small farm, there are four calves being fattened, one milk cow, and the family is now cultivating onions.   Nazira is taking out a loan for 100,000 som (KGS) to buy two calves and some ewes. This will allow Nazira to increase her livestock and to expand the farm. In the future, Nazira and her husband dream of giving their children a good education and building a big house.  \r\n\r\n\r\nBai-Tushum and Partners uses Kiva funding to target the especially vulnerable population.

Especially remarkable are Senegal\u2019s networks of rotating savings and credit associations, known as tontines. Commonly organized by groups of twenty to thirty housewives who live in the same village, the tontines provide poor women throughout the country with small loans to finance modest income-generating activities. Repayment rates within these associations are excellent, because they are based on local reputation and personal trust between the members. However, their financial resources are limited to the contributions of their members, frequently subsistence farmers with very little disposable income. This has prevented the traditional tontines from meeting the demand for rural microenterprise loans and restricted their impact on the economic development of their communities. The SEM Fund works to bridge this gap by linking traditional village credit associations with outside sources of finance."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":975,"image":{"id":36014,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"Homemade incense production - harvesting expenses, storage jars, and transportation to market","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SN","country":"Senegal","town":"Nder","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"16.255 -15.887222","type":"point"}},"partner_id":4,"posted_date":"2007-05-28T20:03:51Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":975,"lender_count":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ndeye","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-06-12T00:42:25Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":975,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":975,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2007-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2007-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2007-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2007-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2007-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2008-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2008-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2008-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2008-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2008-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2008-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":81.25}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2008-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":81.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":82,"local_amount":82,"processed_date":"2007-07-01T09:15:03Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-01T09:26:19Z","rounded_local_amount":82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27571},{"amount":95,"local_amount":95,"processed_date":"2007-07-22T17:33:57Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-01T09:26:19Z","rounded_local_amount":95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":34398},{"amount":89,"local_amount":89,"processed_date":"2007-09-03T17:04:48Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-01T09:26:19Z","rounded_local_amount":89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":50185},{"amount":89,"local_amount":89,"processed_date":"2007-10-06T00:40:58Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-01T09:26:19Z","rounded_local_amount":89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63338},{"amount":55,"local_amount":55,"processed_date":"2007-11-11T16:49:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-01T09:26:19Z","rounded_local_amount":55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":80045},{"amount":82,"local_amount":82,"processed_date":"2007-12-08T21:39:23Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-01T09:26:19Z","rounded_local_amount":82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":93781},{"amount":82,"local_amount":82,"processed_date":"2008-01-03T04:39:17Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-01T09:26:19Z","rounded_local_amount":82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":106880},{"amount":82,"local_amount":82,"processed_date":"2008-02-16T20:59:23Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-01T09:26:19Z","rounded_local_amount":82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136703},{"amount":164,"local_amount":164,"processed_date":"2008-04-01T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-01T09:26:19Z","rounded_local_amount":164,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":170172},{"amount":82,"local_amount":82,"processed_date":"2008-05-01T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-01T09:26:19Z","rounded_local_amount":82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":197318},{"amount":73,"local_amount":73,"processed_date":"2008-06-01T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-01T09:26:19Z","rounded_local_amount":73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":224308}],"funded_date":"2007-05-29T00:42:25Z","paid_date":"2008-06-01T09:00:11Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":14268,"name":"Salomat","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Salomat is married and has 3 children.

She became a member of the TYM Fund in 1996, borrowing money to invest in raising pigs.  In 2002, she and her family used a loan to run a model fish farm in a pond belonging to the local co-operative.  Today, her family has 400 laying ducks, two groups of sows, and one fish pond, which together provide an income of about 3,000,000 VND (180 USD) per month.  In the next lending cycle, she hopes to borrow 10,000,000 VND (600 USD) to buy feed for her animals.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Vietnamese by Robert Sides, Kiva

She is also into selling \"Ready to Wear\" clothing of GTY. Venus has been engaged in her business for over 17 years and earns ~3,200 PHP a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Venus joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Venus has successfully repaid a previous loan of 4,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to purchase dried fish to sell. Venus is requesting a new loan of 6,000 PHP as additional capital for her businesses. This will be her 2nd loan from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to support her children\u2019s education.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, we created this template for our field staff to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate

Esterlita has been engaged in her business for over two years and earns approximately 5,000 PHP per month from these activities.\r\n<br>In 2009, Esterlita joined Kiva partner, HSPFI, to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 7,000 PHP from HSPFI. This loan was used to purchase additional inventory and as working capital. Esterlita is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be her third from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement her family's income. \r\n<p>\r\n<b>About HSPFI<\/b><br>\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n<p>\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, we created this template for our field staff to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":545745,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

The tough experience mill she was brought to terms with whilst still running her salon business was enough to help her dispense with the naivet\u00e9 of operating a business.

republics of the Soviet Union. Several farmers joined together in farming activities such as agriculture, cattle breeding and dairy production. This was a strategy for boosting the country\u2019s production. Unfortunately, \u201ckolkhozy\u201d failed after the collapse of the Soviet Union, leaving hundreds of thousands of peasants managing the land on their own. \r\n<br>Sairagul S., 43, is the leader of this group. In Soviet times she used to be a dairymaid in a local \u201ckolkhoz\u201d. Like many others, she was left helpless after the collapse of Soviet Union. Having no education, but excellent skills in cattle breeding, she decided to continue this occupation. Three years ago, Sairagul ventured into the resale of cattle, which proved successful. Nowadays she spends most of her time taking care of cattle, but she also works as a salesperson in a nearby market on weekdays. Sairagul earns 6,000 KGS per month, but she still is unable to purchase some sheep for resale. In order to accomplish this goal she has applied for a loan from Kiva. Sairagul would like to spend her business returns on finishing the construction of her house, which she started two years ago. \r\n<p>\r\n<b>Where did this loan come from?<\/b><br>\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance, a young and ambitious socially-focused MFI in Kyrgyzstan.

He is 30 years old, married, and has one child.  Cruz has been farming for more than 16 years.\r\n<p>\r\nHe is originally from the community of Los Arguetas in the Department of Jinotega, which is approximately 42 kilometers north of Esteli.  At the age of six, he remembers helping his father with the farming duties around their home.  He started by helping herd the cows and caring for the baby chicks.  When he was 12 years old, Cruz planted his first crop with the help of a friend.  Later when he was 18 years old, he started planting cabbage, also with the help of a friend.\r\n<p>\r\nWhen he got married at the age of 22, his mother-in-law helped him with the planting of cabbage and onions.  During the off-season, he engages in the purchase and sale of cattle.  Cruz applied for this loan in order to buy supplies for planting onions.

As a fruit of their great love, they have two children: Samith, 10 years old, and Ruth, 7 years of age. They live together in their own home where happiness reigns. Sarita is a very business-oriented woman with many desires of excelling in life; she is the boss of her own snow cone business called Raspadillas Sarita (Sarita's Snow Cones). She has worked there for two years and tells us that her first investment was 1,500 nuevos soles for the ice grinder and a cart on which to sell the fruit and snow cones. At the beginning, it was difficult for her to acquire new clients, but then her popularity grew as people tried the snow cones and liked them. Today she enjoys her work and the good income that the sale of this beverage generates. She advises that the secrets to a good business are: having willpower, being creative, selling unusual products, providing good service, paying attention to the cleanliness and attending well to her clients. The plan for her business' future is to buy another blender in order to keep up with the demand. This is the fourth loan with MFP and she is saving in order to be able to make her payments on time, seeing as she doesn't want to cause any problems with her communal bank because she is very happy with it. With the 1500 nuevos soles, she will buy a blender because her current blender doesn't suffice.

She will also remodel her rental rooms a little.  \r\n\r\nReyna hopes that this investment will enable her business to prosper since she would like to provide her children with a better quality of life and would like to give her youngest daughter the opportunity to study for a career."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":777428,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to sell meals and rent out rooms","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Tierra Blanca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2011-05-26T14:30:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":450,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Reyna ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-05-05T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":5000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":312.5},{"due_date":"2011-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":312.5},{"due_date":"2011-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":312.5},{"due_date":"2011-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":312.5},{"due_date":"2011-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":312.5},{"due_date":"2011-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":312.5},{"due_date":"2011-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":312.5},{"due_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":312.5},{"due_date":"2011-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":312.5},{"due_date":"2011-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":312.5},{"due_date":"2011-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":312.5},{"due_date":"2011-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":312.5},{"due_date":"2011-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":312.5},{"due_date":"2011-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":312.5},{"due_date":"2011-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":312.5},{"due_date":"2011-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":312.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.13},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.12},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.13},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.12},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.13},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.12},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.13},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.12},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.13},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.12},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.13},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.12},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.13},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.12},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.13},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.12}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":112.55,"local_amount":1250.6,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:22:18Z","rounded_local_amount":1320.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211233887},{"amount":112.45,"local_amount":1249.4,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:12:28Z","rounded_local_amount":1318.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216512723},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":1250,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-19T07:48:03Z","rounded_local_amount":1319.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":222223369},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":1250,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-16T08:10:27Z","rounded_local_amount":1319.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227201646}],"funded_date":"2011-05-28T02:51:18Z","paid_date":"2011-09-16T08:10:27Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Oxnard","image":null}},{"id":306030,"name":"Jacqueline","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jacqueline is 37 years old, single, and has one child.

She is married and mother of five (05) children and has  another dependant. She is living at Fidokpui with all her family where she has as main activity the planting and selling of vegetables (Ad\u00e9m\u00e9, Gboma, and okro) the only source of income of the family. This garden market product is becoming more and more difficult to find otherwise impossible already from the month of November where starts  the dry season and water became very rare. During that period, life in this couple became pitiful. The husband does not have any other job than the small subsistence agriculture and leave almost all the family charge between the hands of the woman. Although she is illiterate, Madam V. has always showed the proof of a rigorous management and good morality. That is a lot noticed in her first three credits obtained which were repaid without incident. \r\n\r\nToday, she is requesting a credit of $850 to buy a motor-pump in order to mastery the water and to continue to progress in her activities especially those of the counter season (dry season). This project will be very profitable, not only for her alone, but for the other women of her locality.\r\n\r\n<p> \r\n\r\nMadame V.

Elle vit \u00e0 Fidokpui avec toute sa famille o\u00f9 elle a comme activit\u00e9 principale la culture et la vente de l\u00e9gumes (Ad\u00e9m\u00e9, Gboma, et Gombo) seule source de revenu de la famille. Cette culture mara\u00eech\u00e8re devient difficile sinon impossible d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e0 partir du mois de Novembre o\u00f9 commence la saison s\u00e8che et l\u2019eau de vient tr\u00e8s rare. Au cours de cette p\u00e9riode, la vie dans ce foyer devient plus pitoyable. Le mari n\u2019a pas autre emploi que la petite agriculture de subsistance et laisse presque toute la charge du foyer entre les mains de la femme. Bien qu\u2019analphab\u00e8te, Madame V.

He is also a widower. He has three children and also takes care of three orphans who were left in his care by his brother who died due to HIV related complications.    \r\n\r\nIn the year 2004, Douglas was privileged to go through two days training on local manufacture of detergents and shampoo, which was conducted by the Methodist Church in Kibera. The training showed how and where to get the ingredients for detergent and shampoo making.  \r\n\r\nDouglas got $5 grant in kind from a friend, which he used to buy the ingredients he needed. He was able to make 20 litres of the detergent. He packed and sold this in plastic containers of 250 and 500 grams that he had collected from a nearby bar within Kibera for $1.50. He also decided to give samples of the detergent he had made to the neighboring organizations, schools and churches in order to advertise his products. It is now two years since he started selling the detergents and shampoo at Fort Jesus, Kibera. He has a wider market, ranging from his neighbors, the schools and churches within Kibera.\r\n\r\nDouglas uses a wooden stick and plastic containers (basins) to mix his ingredients. He produces 80 litres of the detergent and shampoo in a week and sells in small quantities. He packs in containers of 20, 10 and 5 litres which he sells to his clients in schools, churches and organizations. He also packs in containers of 100 \u2013 500 grams that he sells at an affordable price ($1.50) to his neighbors. He usually stores the little amount that remains in the plastic containers that he uses to mix the ingredients because of the shortage of storage containers.  \r\n\r\nDouglas sees that his business is expanding and has a wider market. Given the loan of $ 75, he plans to purchase 30 plastic containers of 20 litres each to enable him store and pack his detergents and shampoo. Douglas has recently been approached by a group of women and youth who have been sponsored by a health clinic within the Kibera slums, to teach them on the process of making the detergent and shampoo. Douglas sees this as a move that will not only increase his income but also positively impact his community, which is characterized by idleness especially among the youth. Douglas also plans to transfer this skill to his children.  The loan is repayable within 6 \u2013 12 months. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":75,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":75,"image":{"id":18529,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Manufacturing","sector":"Manufacturing","themes":null,"use":"To purchase plastic containers for storage of detergent","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kibera Slums, Nairobi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":36,"posted_date":"2007-03-09T00:59:36Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":75,"lender_count":3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Douglas","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-03-23T01:02:31Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":75,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":75,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2007-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2007-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2007-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2007-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2007-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":12.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2007-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2007-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2007-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":12.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":26,"local_amount":26,"processed_date":"2007-06-18T09:17:25Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-19T18:51:33Z","rounded_local_amount":26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":24152},{"amount":13,"local_amount":13,"processed_date":"2007-07-18T09:18:25Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-19T18:51:33Z","rounded_local_amount":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":33367},{"amount":13,"local_amount":13,"processed_date":"2007-08-18T09:18:45Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-19T18:51:33Z","rounded_local_amount":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44087},{"amount":13,"local_amount":13,"processed_date":"2007-09-18T09:18:47Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-19T18:51:33Z","rounded_local_amount":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":56066},{"amount":10,"local_amount":10,"processed_date":"2007-10-18T09:19:48Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-19T18:51:33Z","rounded_local_amount":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":69034}],"funded_date":"2007-03-09T02:02:31Z","paid_date":"2007-10-18T09:19:48Z","journal_totals":{"entries":8,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":10188,"name":"Kosio","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Kosio K. is a carpenter.

She was given a loan of USD171 which she used to stock a variety of household items commonly bought by residents in the area. The business grew. After one year, she paid back the loan and received another loan of USD28 from Feed The Children Uganda in December 1999.

This is 52-year-old Anna M. from Tukuyu. She is widow with six children between the ages of 18 and 37. She is also responsible for supporting two other people because they are orphans.

Anna currently earns about $100 a month from her business. She is requesting a loan of $375 to buy more clothes in bulk. In the future, she plans to increase the quantity of items she has for sale. Anna  thanks you for your support!\r\n\r\nABOUT SELFINA:\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":255907,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"To buy more clothes in bulk","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbeya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.9 33.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-01-16T17:00:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Anna S.

He would like to use the loan to buy more cartons of frozen foods to enable him to raise enough income to build a permanent store for himself. He also wants the loan to buy items to stock his inventory before the Easter season. Eric belongs to a village bank called \u2018Sunkwa,\u2019 which means \u2018Pray for Life\u2019.

He lives with his partner, Mirta, who is 49.  They have three children ages 21, 18, and 13.  \r\n\r\nBenedicto is a sacrificing man who worked various years in Argentina.  He worked in construction for almost 20 years, and he met Mirta there.  With the money he was able to save during that time, he was able to return to his country, Paraguay, to stay.\r\n\r\nOnce back in his country, together they were able to start their own business.  She currently has a small store in her home.  Benedicto has a taxi service in It\u00e1, the city they are both from.  \r\n\r\nThanks to his effort and help from Mirta, he now has two cars, which are used in the taxi service.\r\n\r\nHe feels very proud of his work and of Mirta for the help she constantly gives him.\r\n\r\nHe is asking for a loan to buy tires and other things like batteries for his vehicle.

Gis\u00e8le s'approvisionne \u00e0 Cotonou, capitale \u00e9conomique du B\u00e9nin. Gis\u00e8le exerce cette activit\u00e9 depuis 10 ans et a d\u00e9j\u00e0 b\u00e9n\u00e9fici\u00e9 de trois cr\u00e9dits de ALID\u00e9. Gis\u00e8le a bien rembours\u00e9 les trois cr\u00e9dits qu'elle avait obtenu. Gis\u00e8le aimerait augmenter le volume de son activit\u00e9 et mieux satisfaire toutes les demandes de sa client\u00e8le. Mais Gis\u00e8le ne r\u00e9unit pas les moyens financiers n\u00e9cessaires pour y arriver. C'est la raison pour laquelle Gis\u00e8le sollicite un quatri\u00e8me pr\u00eat de ALID\u00e9, afin d'augmenter son fonds de roulement. ","en":"Gis\u00e8le Z. was born on May 4, 1984. She has been living for eight years in the neighborhood of Djassin, the third arrondissement [municipal district] of Porto-Novo in Benin. Gis\u00e8le is married to Marius Afaton and is the mother of one child. The family lives together and the couple provides for the different needs of the family.\r\n\r\nTo meet her needs, Gis\u00e8le\u2019s business activity is the door-to-door sale of clothing, perfumes and also of iceboxes. She gets her supplies in Cotonou, the economic capital of Benin. She has been practicing this activity for 10 years and has already received three loans from ALID\u00e9. She has fully reimbursed the three loans she received.\r\n\r\nGis\u00e8le would like to increase the volume of her activity to better meet all the demands of her customers. However she cannot bring together the necessary financial means to succeed. For this reason, she is requesting a fourth loan from ALID\u00e9 in order to increase her working capital.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by V\u00e9ronique Fourment, Kiva

supplies in their store which has lately been expanded. Their store is filled with attractive, reasonably priced items that appeal to many customers who are looking to build something like an office, a house, etc. \r\n\r\nMiyansarkhon has been in business for about 4 years. She likes what she sells and has developed a stable enterprise. Currently she has requested a loan to help purchase a new supply of items to sell. \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Poblacion, Sibonga, Cebu. She earns her living by operating two business ventures: livestock and food processing. Her husband Rodrigo D., who is 36 years old, works as a carpenter to earn his living and also helps in his wife's business activities. They have six children who range from 13 to 18 years old. \r\n\r\nDaisy joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2007 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past five loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Daisy has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 9,000 Philippine pesos (PHP) helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 6,000, thus uplifting the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her sixth loan, she is borrowing PHP 10,000, which she intends to use as additional capital for her business so that she can continue to save up for the future and for her children to finish their educations.  \r\n\r\nDaisy D. is a Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means \"honorable\") woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.\r\n\r\n<b>About NWTF:<\/b>\r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon. Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Leading a nomadic lifestyle, they have worked out special strategies for raising healthy cattle high in the Kyrgyz mountains.\r\n\r\nKulsiyna K., 44, is the leader of this group, consisting of four experienced and ambitious cattle-breeders. Five years ago, having some savings and a big desire to start a successful business, she had to decide where to invest her start up capital. A widow with three sons living apart, Kulsiyna started with purchasing just a few head of cattle. She would feed and look after them carefully and go to the nearest stockyard to sell them. \r\n\r\nSoon she found out that the more carefully you look after cattle, the more productive you are going to be. Over these years she\u2019s been quite successful, and now that she is more confident and experienced, she would like to try raising sheep and goats, which are also in high demand. \r\n\r\nKulsiyna hopes to obtain the loan in order to purchase sheep and goats, since a monthly income of about $44 is unfortunately not enough. In the future she would like to help her sons arrange nice wedding ceremonies with lots of guests and good memories. \r\n\r\n --- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance (MBF), a young, ambitious and socially-focused Micro-finance Institution in Kyrgyzstan. \r\nMBF is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development and upholds the triple bottom line \u2013 People (building human capital and taking care of its customers as well as society), Planet (keeping environmentally friendly) and Profit (earning revenue to expand autonomously).

He is married to an experienced small-scale retailer and has seven children aged 3, 6, 9, 11, 15, 18 and 21 years. He has one additional dependent, who lives with him because he helps him with his business.  \r\n\r\nIn 1999, Mohamed established his photography and photocopying equipment and accessories business.  Working 6 days a week and 10 hours a day, he earns about Le 1,450,000 every month from this business. He would like a loan in the amount of Le 5,000,000. Mohamed  has already received and successfully repaid two loans and now requires a new loan in order to buy film (2 packets @ Le450,000), batteries (2 cartons  @ Le150,000), 1 camera at Le700,000, duplicating papers (2 cartons @ Le500,000) and photocopy ink (3 cartons  @ Le600,000). He hopes that this loan will enable him to increase his monthly profits by approximately Le 300,000. \r\n\r\nIn the future, Mohamed plans to buy a vehicle, establish a bar with a cinema, and educate his children to the highest level they wish to achieve.

She sews clothes, such as shirts, trousers, and dresses and then sells them in her shop.\r\n\r\nShe works at her business for 9 hours a day, 6 days a week. She works there with another member of her family. Queen currently earns about $200 USD a month from her business. She is requesting a loan of $375 USD in order to to buy another two sewing machines for her business. In the future, she plans to employ someone to help her so she can expand her business. Queen thanks you for your support!\r\n\r\nABOUT SELFINA:\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":255961,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Tailoring","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"To to buy another two sewing machines for her business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbeya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.9 33.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-01-19T16:50:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Queen O.

Because of her commitments, during the week she lives in the urban zone of Nueva Guinea in the Linda Vista neighborhood.

Each time she goes to buy products to supply her store her daughter helps her, so she can avoid becoming a victim of assault.

She is 49 years old. Nenita is married and has 5 adult children. To make a living, Nenita owns and operates a business venture in the agriculture sector, raising livestock. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from raising pigs for fattening and sale. Nenita has been engaged in her business for over 13 years and earns approximately 3,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Nenita joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Nenita has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to to purchase baby livestock to raise and sell in future. Nenita is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase livestock feed and other supplies. This loan will be the 2nd loan taken out by Nenita from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines.

Rukhsana has applied for a loan from Kiva partner Asasah to help expand her husband\u2019s business. He will use this loan to buy fruit in bulk and increase his sales. Rukhsana hopes that this investment will be a great help for her husband\u2019s business and mean an improved life for her family.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":612177,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits &

is married with two children. He started his business selling general goods 10 years ago. Financial assistance from IMON International has helped Marufjon develop and expand his business. Marufjon is planning to use this loan of 7,000 TJS to purchase additional goods to expand his assortment. He believes a variety of merchandise will boost his sales and help him generate additional profit. Marufjon\u2019s goal is to continue refining his business skills so that he can keep his venture growing and provide for his family's needs. \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

After working for many years in highway construction and after seeing the need for more money in his family, he decided to open a stall in the central market in the city with his wife.  With the help of his wife and his 2 sons he works very hard 6 days a week, come rain or shine.  His main motivation is to give his children the opportunity to go to university as neither he nor his wife were lucky enough to do this.  All of his children study and his eldest daughter is doing the entry exam to study Medicine in the UNA (National University of Asunci\u00f3n).  Valerio does not only have this stall, but he also rears pigs in a sty that he inherited from his parents.  Valerio wants to increase his earnings and would like to buy merchandise in larger quantities so that he can sell more in his stall and sell to other stalls.  He is asking for a loan of $675 with which he will buy sugar, flour, oil, grain and dairy products etc.\r\n\r\n<p> <b> Translated from Spanish by Liz Harvey, Kiva Volunteer <\/b> <p>\r\n\r\nValerio tiene 52 a\u00f1os, es casado y tiene  3 hijos.

As the family grew, the expenses grew as well, and Gilberto had to leave the home to find a stable job. Currently he works as a miner far from their village. Meanwhile, Rosita has continued to devote herself to selling milk, which brings in a good income. They hope to purchase another cow to improve their economic situation and allow Gilberto to return to his home and care for the animals, selling milk alongside his beloved wife and children.

She has spent the last 11 years dedicating herself to this business. The business generates enough income in order to be able to live with dignity. lMON has provided Matluba with financial help for the last year, which has allowed her to increase her stock and ensure her three children\u2019s sustenance. She currently has a pressing need to acquire more shoes for the winter season in order to market them, and for this reason she came to IMON looking for more support. Her goal is to continue expanding and improving her business every day, considering that her husband's job as a driver does not earn enough and her children have no steady work. So, Matluba has to work hard in order to improve their living conditions. Matluba is very grateful to everyone who is helping her. \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road, the end of Alexander the Great's rule, and the birthplace of the great Persian poet Rudaki and the most famous Islamic philosopher Ibn Sina (Avicenna). The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, and Central Asian traditions. But Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.
