She is 64 years old and lives with her husband and two children in a comfortable one-story home that they own and is made of solid materials.\r\n<p>\r\nWhat Judith enjoys most is knitting and she does it very well.  She engages in this activity every day of the week, especially in the evenings.  Her creations are mainly sweaters made using knitting needles or by crochet.  Using an endless number of colorful yarns, Judith gives shape to different styles and sizes of garments.  Her products are highly sought after by her customers.  She has been in this business for approximately ten years and she has two assistants who help with completing her orders.\r\n<p>\r\nJudith is very happy with what she does.  She never imagined that the skill that her mother taught her would one day help provide financial support.  Her wish for the future is to build various rooms to her house that can be rented.  This will help generate income with little effort.\r\n<p>\r\nThis is her fifth loan with MFP.

Alimango, Escalante City, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating a business venture as an Avon Cosmetics Dealer.  \r\n\r\nHer husband, Francis B., is 30 years old and works as a laborer to earn his living. They have no children.\r\n\r\nVictoria joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2007 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past eight loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Victoria has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty through hard work. Her previous loan of 9,000 PHP helped her earn a monthly profit of 6,000 PHP which increased the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 9th loan cycle, she is borrowing 10,000 PHP which she intends to use to to improve her business so that she can continue to save up for future house improvements. \r\n\r\nVictoria B. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":554504,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics

She is 55 years old. She is married and has three adult children. To make a good living, Florinda owns and operates a vegetable vending business at Trade Town of San Jose. Florinda has been engaged in her business for over 10 years and earns good profits for these activities. In 1999, Florinda aimed to join ASHI to secure access to financial services to help improve her living condition and to have the ability to engage in more business activities. Florinda has successfully repaid a previous loan from ASHI. Since she was able to repay her previous loan, she is now qualified to apply for another loan with a higher amount than the first one she had. Now, she plans to utilize this and future loans in the same business until it grows. She wishes that some day, she can put up her own stall, not rent in the public market, so that her income will increase and she will be able to give her customers convenient purchases in their village that is far away from the marketplace.\r\n\r\nShe hopes that, with the help of this KIVA field partner, she can reach her ambitions to step out from under the umbrella of poverty, develop her business, and provide for the needs of her grandchildren in school.\r\n\r\nFlorinda's aspiration for all of her children is for them to have a decent living, and this is the reason she wants her business to succeed. Her loan in ASHI is a very important factor that could lead her towards fulfillment. With her hard work, focus, and determination, Florinda is hopeful that her business ventures will continue to grow and improve the overall standard of living for her entire family.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":603271,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

These two have 9 children, but only two of them live with them: Eden (18) and C\u00e9sar (15). In family union, they live in their own home, located in the town of Uni\u00f3n Palomar (central Peruvian jungle).  This married couple, despite their advanced age, continues together and, above all, works a lot in order to help their two last children get ahead. They have worked in agriculture for the last 15 years. Their principal crops consist of coffee, avocados and bananas. Herlinda tells us that they both coordinate to be able to sell their crops; while she goes to sell the bananas (which they harvest every 15 days) at the central market La Merced, her husband Jes\u00fas sells their coffee beans in the Alto Palomar cooperative. Through all the effort they put in these years, they have succeeded in obtaining more than 3 hectares of land for agriculture, in which they plan on increasing the quality and quantity of their crops. This is the first time that Herlinda is taking a loan with MFP, and she hopes to achieve her goals with the support of the members of this new association. With the loan that she will receive, she plans to buy several sacks of organic fertilizer that she will spread over her coffee nursery.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":677460,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy sacks of fertilizer for her coffee plantation","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Chanchamayo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.05 -75.316667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-12-25T18:00:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Erlinda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-12-13T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":375}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":375,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T09:12:54Z","rounded_local_amount":1050.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221718364}],"funded_date":"2010-12-25T22:24:37Z","paid_date":"2011-08-15T09:12:54Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jacqueline Demeranville","image":1016015}},{"id":265263,"name":"Marilin","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Marilin es una cliente de 24 a\u00f1os, conviviente, que reside con su pareja y su hija en el distrito de Tambogrande, una zona agr\u00edcola que pertenece a la regi\u00f3n Piura y que se encuentra situada a m\u00e1s de tres horas y media de la ciudad de Chiclayo, capital de la regi\u00f3n Lambayeque.\n\nSe dedica a preparar y vender salchipollos (plato consistente en una fritura de pollo, mezclado con papas fritas, hot dog y ensalada de verduras).

T., 53, is a villager in Shahristan town in Northern Tajikistan. He and his wife are farmers who own a 0.5 hectare of land where they cultivate vegetables. They are also engaged in the business of raising and selling cattle. On their plantation, they now face the obstacle of not having enough money to buy seeds and fertilizer for planting. Ibrohim is therefore requesting a loan to purchase seeds and fertilizer for his crop, as well as to buy young cattle.\r\n  \r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International: \r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The women live in traditional families, and they average 33 years of age and seven children each. They grow peanuts and sesame. \r\n\r\nConcerned about making their plantations profitable, the group members decided to join the loan program of the micro-finance institution Soro Yiriwaso about four years ago. After properly repaying the previous loans, they are now on their fourth farm loan.\r\n\r\nKADIA, who is seated in the photo and wearing a white T-shirt, intends to buy some peanut seeds, sundry supplies and equipment, and soil amendments for farming. These items will be purchased at the main market of Kimparana and at surrounding markets. Following the off-season, the harvested crops are stocked for a certain time, so that they gain in value. Then they are sold retail (often wholesale) for cash. Their customers generally come from large cities. \r\n\r\nAfter selling their produce, the group members each plan on making a profit of 75,000 to 90,000 francs CFA that will be used for paying the interest on the loan and for typical family expenses. \r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2125,"image":{"id":789476,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"to buy farm supplies, seeds, and tools and to pay for plowing","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Moribila Kafonon","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2125,"lender_count":76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hawa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bintou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Minata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Salimata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatoumata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Salimata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatoumata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sali ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Minata D ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mamine ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-05-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":950000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":2125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":950000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2125}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":2125,"local_amount":950000,"processed_date":"2012-02-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-16T08:45:46Z","rounded_local_amount":959341.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263424518}],"funded_date":"2011-07-04T23:50:53Z","paid_date":"2012-04-16T08:45:46Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Daniel Kuey","image":669418}},{"id":310341,"name":"Mariana Del Jes\u00fas","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"En la ciudadela Municipal  de la ciudad de Portoviejo, capital de Manab\u00ed conocida desde hace muchos a\u00f1os  como la ciudad de los reales tamarindos, se re\u00fanen cada quince d\u00edas  las socias del Banco Comunal Nueva Estrella Solidaria.\n\nAqu\u00ed conocimos a la se\u00f1ora Mariana tiene 55 a\u00f1os  de edad, es madre soltera de tres hijos, dos de ellos ya mayores de edad y un chica de 17 a\u00f1os que este mes empieza a estudiar en la universidad, todos sus hijos aun viven en su casa.

She is an entrepreneur living in Ivano-Frankivsk. She works as a vendor at the main industrial market \u201cTraian.\u201d After finishing technical college, Svitlana decided against accepting a low-paying job and started working as a marketplace vendor instead. After having worked for three years as an employee, she decided to launch her own business, which she is still running at present. She sells various accessories such as belts, handbags, caps, blazers, slippers etc. Her stall is well known with customers thanks to her low prices on a wide variety of goods. Svitlana has been doing this line of work for eight years. Her monthly income is 5,000 Hryvnias (UAH). She is requesting a loan of 10,000 UAH. She plans to stock up on belts (250 pcs) and handbags (15 pcs) for retail. She would like to get ready for August and replenish her selection of goods oriented toward young people. Svitlana\u2019s business is the main source of income for her family. She does not get discouraged, even though she had to give up one of her stalls due to   financial crisis. At least she  has managed to preserve her business, and now she continues to grow it further. Svitlana would like to use her anticipated earnings to pay for repairs in the apartment where her whole family lives. Note: this loan description is provided in Russian.

She has seven children and her economic situation is stable, but she now lives in her own home with her daughter Karina, a single mother, whom she helps. They live in the Huancal - Huaricolca town.\r\nHer vitality and and courage are demonstrated in her successes. She is proud of her oldest daughter, Mily, age 25, who just finished nursing school; like Mily, two of her brothers are professionals. Despite her limitations, Rosalia was able to pay for her children's university studies. All of this is thanks to her crops of potato, ulluco, barley and oats, which bring her a good income. Currently her harvests are very sought-after in the city's central market. And, as the hard-working woman that she is, during agricultural seasons she travels to the cities of Lima, Chanchamayo and Masamari to sell her tubers wholesale, and to sell vegetables at retail prices. However, the agricultural seasons do not last all year, so this bright woman has several heads of ovine and bovine livestock which helps her to cover some costs. For the future, she is planning to expand her livestock business through improving her animal farm. She belongs to the \"Nueva Esperanza\" [\"New Hope\"] Communal Bank, and this is her tenth loan with MFP. In MFP she is known in her communal bank as a responsible person, and because of this she occupies an important position in the group. She promises to be punctual with her quotas. Rosalia plans to purchase 50 bags of potato seeds of the Yungay, Unica and Canchan variety. Upon receiving your support, she will invest the requested loan in the purchase of various bags of natural fertilizers to start her new planting with success. She will also pay the labourers who help her during the day."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":857402,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy bags of fertilizer and to hire labourers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-08-29T23:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1100,"lender_count":38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosalia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-08-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":3000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1100}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":1100,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:48:11Z","rounded_local_amount":3005.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287097695}],"funded_date":"2011-08-30T04:00:03Z","paid_date":"2012-07-15T09:48:11Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Christine Cooper","image":1766620}},{"id":334940,"name":"Jaime Antonio","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Don Jaime es un hombre luchador de 50 a\u00f1os de edad, casado con 2 hijos.\n\nEl se\u00f1or Jaime desde muy peque\u00f1o inicio a trabajar en el campo siendo un agricultor.

They all helpeach other out and live in their own house.  After much effort, she and her husband managed to start a metal foundery and have been working there for the past year and a half.  They melt down bronze and make singular, multi-shaped keyrings which they sell in various markets in their home district.  Dar\u00edo, her husband, creates the keyrings letting his imagination run wild shaping objects that range from miniature hands, to football team emblems, to cartoon characters, animals, etc.  Emilia helps him by polishing and giving the final touches like attaching the rings that serve to secure the keys.  This earns them good income because they make a good team working together for the wellbeing of the family.  This is Emilia's second loan with MFP.  She has always been very punctual with repayments and she enjoys being part of a cooperative group very much because all the members are good, responsible friends.  With the funds she is requesting now she will buy supplies to continue making pretty keyrings and thus increase her profits and improve her business.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":428986,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Metal Shop","sector":"Manufacturing","themes":null,"use":"To buy supplies.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-11-18T03:40:16Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":700,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Emilia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-10-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":303.92},{"due_date":"2009-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":317.04},{"due_date":"2010-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":326.58},{"due_date":"2010-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":337.25},{"due_date":"2010-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":353.37},{"due_date":"2010-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":361.84}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":106.37},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":110.97},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":114.3},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":118.04},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":123.68},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":126.64}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":106.37,"local_amount":303.92,"processed_date":"2009-11-21T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:55:46Z","rounded_local_amount":307.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103843192},{"amount":217.34,"local_amount":620.96,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T21:08:21Z","rounded_local_amount":629.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734782},{"amount":7.93,"local_amount":22.66,"processed_date":"2010-01-21T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:10:31Z","rounded_local_amount":22.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118124124},{"amount":118.04,"local_amount":337.25,"processed_date":"2010-02-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:49:13Z","rounded_local_amount":341.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123959846},{"amount":123.68,"local_amount":353.37,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:33:24Z","rounded_local_amount":358.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128992691},{"amount":126.64,"local_amount":361.84,"processed_date":"2010-04-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:37:42Z","rounded_local_amount":366.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136717475}],"funded_date":"2009-11-18T06:22:10Z","paid_date":"2010-05-15T11:37:42Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":158090,"name":"Mar\u00eda Teresa","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"En la ciudad de Managua, la se\u00f1ora Mar\u00eda R. se dedica arduamente a su trabajo para mejorar las condiciones de su hogar ya que ella es madre soltera y con cuatro hijos a su cargo de los cuales tres de ellos estudian.\nEs de importancia destacar que ella es una mujer muy trabajadora y con muchos deseos de superarse en la vida.

The main source of income for the business comes from providing motor cab services to local community members. Romulo has been engaged in his business for over 3 years and earns approximately 3,000 PHP a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Romulo joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and ability to engage in business activities. He is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP, which will be used to repair a transport vehicle used in the business. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Romulo from GDMPC. He plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of his family. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

The two live in a home they own located in a frigid zone in the Peruvian mountains. His father died when Andr\u00e9s was a young man (23 years old), so he was forced to take control of the household finances. Even though he didn't care for agriculture, he started planting potatoes, peas, and corn on his father's land. What saddens Andr\u00e9s is not having his own family to accompany him and support his farming activities, or expecting a hot meal after a difficult day. Despite the difficulties he has faced, he considers his work lucrative because thanks to his profits he has been able to take care of household expenses as well as purchase more land that is now producing great harvests. Along with the hope of forming a family and having a number of children, in the future he wishes to keep saving money so he can build a home in the city where he can set up a business selling tubers, and he also wants to increase his agricultural production.

Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating 2 business ventures: pig fattening and a Jeepney transport businesses. Her husband, Antonio, who is 53 years old, works as a driver to earn his living and also helps in his wife's business activities. They have 2 children, 23 and 25 years old. \r\n\r\nLiberty joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2003 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 12 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Liberty has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 12,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 6,000 - uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her 13th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 12,000, which she intends to use to pay for the franchise of a vehicle that will be used for business so that she can continue to save up for future home repairs. \r\n\r\nLiberty D. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest

years. Kot Radha Kishen is known for its dairy industry. She is married to M. H. who is a driver by trade and drives a rickshaw. Through the rickshaw, he provides transport services to passengers. He has been in this business for over 10 years. \r\n\r\nShamim has given birth to 4 sons and a daughter. She couldn\u2019t provide her elder children with education due to poor financial conditions. So they started doing different kinds of work in their teenage years. Her eldest son is a hairdresser by trade. The 2nd one works in a factory for a low salary and the third one is a tailor by trade.  \r\n\r\nNow, due to her children\u2019s work, Shamim\u2019s financial conditions have become much better and she is able to enroll her younger children in school.  She has applied for a loan from Kiva partner Asasah for her husband\u2019s business. With the loan, he will replace his old tyres with new tyres because the old cart can't cover long distances before it gets a puncture and that is affecting his work and income. Shamim is hopeful that after investing money in his business, her husband will be able to provide better transport services to his passengers.  \r\n\r\nShe is a regular loan user of Asasah and this is her 6th loan application. In past years, she has maintained a good credit history by paying installments on time and attending every meeting. \r\n \r\nNote: In the photo, the lady who holds a book (called Asasah Passbook) is Shamim.

This time, for her 8th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 13,000, which she intends to use to purchase more varieties of goldfish to raise and sell in order to continue to save up for her children's future education.

She is married with four children between the ages of 29 and 13. She arrived in the city at 15 years of age with high hopes of gaining a better quality of life. She studied part of her high school certificate before working for a private company where she made clothes for ten years. With the knowledge she gained throughout her time there, she finally decided to leave the company to start her own business at the age of 26, when she married and had four children. As time passed, her clothing business grew to be a workshop with two employees who operate the machinery.  \r\n\r\nThis is the fifteenth loan that Dermis has received from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo. She has been part of this organisation for 16 years. With the help of this foundation she has been able to improve the infrastructure of her business, expand her client base and improve the conditions of the premises where her workshop is located. With this loan from Kiva, Dermis will purchase materials such as fabrics, thread, buttons and supplies to make school uniforms. This investment will be successful because she has contracts to make school uniforms and physical education uniforms for three schools in the area. \r\n\r\nDermis' dream is to continue improving her premises and to increase her production with more employees and more machinery operators. This is a challenge for her, as is the goal of attaining the ever-increasing efficiency and quality which the market she wishes to tap into demands. Dermis' current financial indicators are as follows: turnover on accounts receivable is 14 days, while inventory turnover is 7 days. Sales profit is at 30%, her current ability to make payments is 68% and her future ability to make payments with the loan is at 64%.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":701415,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"Purchase materials such as fabric, thread, buttons and supplies to make school uniforms","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2011-02-03T00:00:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Dermis Kellys","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":73191},{"due_date":"2011-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":77188},{"due_date":"2011-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":78475},{"due_date":"2011-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":79783},{"due_date":"2011-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":81112},{"due_date":"2011-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":82464},{"due_date":"2011-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":83839},{"due_date":"2011-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":85236},{"due_date":"2011-11-05T07:00:00Z","amount":86656},{"due_date":"2011-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":88101},{"due_date":"2012-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":89569},{"due_date":"2012-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":94386}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.26},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.45},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.16},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.88},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.61},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.36},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.11},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.88},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.66},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.45},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.27},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.91}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":132.54,"local_amount":240983,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:09:00Z","rounded_local_amount":246790.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201289246},{"amount":139.15,"local_amount":252996,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:05:30Z","rounded_local_amount":259093.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206157385},{"amount":152.47,"local_amount":277226,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:17:56Z","rounded_local_amount":283907.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211230395},{"amount":125.84,"local_amount":228795,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:09:49Z","rounded_local_amount":234308.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216509257}],"funded_date":"2011-02-03T07:56:02Z","paid_date":"2011-07-15T11:09:49Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Suzanne Grasso","image":357930}},{"id":273474,"name":"Lilian","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lilian is a single woman who owns a house that has neither electricity nor piped water.

Karamat's husband, who makes a living as a cab driver, believes that they do not have enough money to buy fertilizer -- and when Karamat heard about loans from Mol Bulak Finance, she put this group together so that they could all join together to get the funding they needed. \r\n\r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n This loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance (MBF), a young, ambitious and socially-focused Microfinance Institution in Kyrgyzstan. \r\n MBF is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development and upholds the triple bottom line \u2013 People (building human capital and taking care of its customers as well as society), Planet (keeping environmentally friendly) and Profit (earning revenue to expand autonomously).

Since her husband is a farmworker, there have been days when he didn't have work, and this is particularly the case during the rainy season.  In addition, her business allows them to have a better quality of life.  This loan will be invested in the purchase of supplies such as: chile peppers, tomatoes, onions, chicken, meat, firewood, corn, etc.  She will use these supplies to continue making her delicious dishes.\r\n\r\nOne of Gloria's goals is to grow her business a lot, since she wants to eventually have a Mexican food restaurant.  This way she could increase her income, so that she can continue to support her children with their education and help them get a professional degree.\r\n\r\nGloria is very grateful to FRAC and to the Kiva lenders for this great support that they are offering her, since thanks to this help, her business and her family life have changed quite a lot.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":885313,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy supplies such as: chile peppers, tomatoes, onions, chicken, meat firewood, corn, etc.  ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2011-10-07T02:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":575,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gloria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-09-05T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":8000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1433.45},{"due_date":"2011-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":1526.59},{"due_date":"2011-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":1607.29},{"due_date":"2012-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":1676.31},{"due_date":"2012-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":1756.36}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":103.03},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":109.72},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":115.53},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":120.48},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":126.24}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":103.03,"local_amount":1433.45,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:22:39Z","rounded_local_amount":1444.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238618957},{"amount":109.72,"local_amount":1526.59,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:03:48Z","rounded_local_amount":1537.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244573202},{"amount":115.49,"local_amount":1606.81,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:12:43Z","rounded_local_amount":1618.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250784914},{"amount":120.52,"local_amount":1676.79,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T10:27:49Z","rounded_local_amount":1689.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257193482},{"amount":126.24,"local_amount":1756.36,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:41:56Z","rounded_local_amount":1769.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263329875}],"funded_date":"2011-10-16T16:24:24Z","paid_date":"2012-03-15T09:41:56Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lisa Grobar","image":264298}},{"id":347264,"name":"Saima's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Saima is 34 years old, married and has 3 daughters and a son.

En esta tarea la ayudan operarios a quienes contrata al d\u00eda, o sino su pareja, siempre y cuando est\u00e9 en la localidad. Por motivos de trabajo, Armando se encuentra en la ciudad de Lima como empleado de una f\u00e1brica de cuadernos, sin embargo siempre regresa a su ciudad natal para ver y atender a su familia. Le gustar\u00eda continuar trabajando con la venta de caf\u00e9, y si hay suerte m\u00e1s adelante irse a vivir a la ciudad capital del pa\u00eds, junto a su pareja e hijos, por la mejor educaci\u00f3n y acceso a servicios. Animada por sus amigos, Katia ingresa al banco comunal \u201cAroma de caf\u00e9\u201d, por eso, \u00e9ste ser\u00eda su primer pr\u00e9stamo de MFP. Afirma su puntualidad y exactitud en los pagos de las cuotas. Agradece por anticipado su apoyo.\nDe obtener el cr\u00e9dito, ella podr\u00e1 comprar bolsas de abonos para sus cultivos de caf\u00e9, as\u00ed como para el pago de personal.\n\n","en":"Katia, age 21, is the young mother of two children ages 2 and 4. She lives with Armando (her partner and the father of her children) in their own home in Santa Rosa de Palomar, in the San Luis de Shuaro district, Chanchamayo province (Selva Central). Katia enjoys working in the fields. She learned this work from her parents and in-laws. She has her own plots of land where she has sown coffee for four years. Coffee sales are good in April, May, June and July, because coffee hits its best price at this time: 1 sol and 80 cents. However, coffee crops require a lot of care and constant fertilizing. Katia hires workers by the day to help her with this work, or else her partner helps her whenever he is around. Armando is employed in the city of Lima in a notebook factory, but he always goes back to the city of his birth in order to see and care for his family. He would enjoy continuing to work selling coffee, and with luck in the future he would like to live in the capital city with his family so that they can have better access to services and education.\r\nKatia joined the \"Aroma de Cafe\" communal bank at the encouragement of friends. This will be her first loan with MFP. She says she will be punctual and precise in the payments of her quotas. She thanks you in advance for your support.\r\nUpon receiving this loan, she will buy bags of fertilizer for her coffee crops and pay for labourers."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":948415,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy bags of organic fertilizer and to hire labourers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Chanchamayo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.05 -75.316667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-12-18T17:30:23Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Katia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-12-13T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":375}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":375,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:32:09Z","rounded_local_amount":1010.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308451230}],"funded_date":"2011-12-19T01:53:01Z","paid_date":"2012-10-16T09:32:09Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Christine Cooper","image":1766620}},{"id":375954,"name":"Bella","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This is Bella, 40, resident of GMA, Cavite City, Philippines.

Since she had never made them at home, she decided to learn how. She grew to enjoy it, and offered the homemade sweets to her acquaintances, who told her that it would be a good idea to sell them. She listened to them, and that's how her business came to be.\r\n<p>\r\nShe felt the need to open the business because of her family's low income. They were spending more now that their son was older, and so she opened a bakery - a business that she enjoyed - which enabled her to earn extra money to cover her family's needs. \r\n<p>\r\nLuz Maria began her business seven years ago, and has never regretted that decision. She has brought in good earnings, which have allowed her to pay for severla unforseen expenses. She has a very good clientele, and even distributes her sweets to big businesses like Helados Sultana, an ice cream company. This creates a steady stream of income to cover household expenses. \r\n<p>\r\nToday, Luz Maria needs a loan of $600, which she will repay in 6 months. She will use the money to buy ingredients to make her sweets so that she can fill her existing long list of orders.\r\n<p>\r\nTranslated by Cynthia McMurry, Kiva volunteer\r\n<p>\r\nLuz Maria  inici\u00f3 el negocio porque a su esposo le gustan mucho las hojarascas y galletas horneadas y como en su casa ya no le hacian, se propuso aprender a hacerlas  y poco a poco le comenzo a gustar mas, entonces las ofrecio a conocidos quienes le  comentaron que, seria buen negocio el venderlas y les hizo caso, asi fue como inicio el negocio que ahora tiene. \r\n<p>\r\nSu principal necesidad para emprender su negocio,  fue la poca entrada de dinero, ya que tenian mas gastos ahora que su hijo estaba creciendo por lo que tomo la reposteria como un negocio que ademas  le  gustaba, y le iba a dejar  dinero extra para cubrir sus necesidades.\r\n<p>\r\nComenz\u00f3  hace  7 a\u00f1os con el negocio y no piensa dejarlo porque desde aquel entonces, le ha dejado buenas ganancias   para salir de algunos imprevistos,  tiene muy buena  clientela e inclusive tiene reparto a negocios grandes como Helados Sultana donde coloco sus productos y este tambien es un ingreso seguro para los gastos de su casa.\r\n<p>\r\nAhora necesita un prestamo por US $600 que pagara en 6  meses,  le va a servir para comprar materia prima para hacer su productos ya que actualmente  tiene muchos pedidos"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":167819,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bakery","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Buy ingredients to make cookies","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Victoria, Tamaulipas","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23.733333 -99.133333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":16,"posted_date":"2008-06-06T04:00:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":600,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Luz Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-06-20T12:23:39Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":6000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2008-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2008-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2008-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2008-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2008-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":100}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":100,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2008-07-06T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-28T19:42:21Z","rounded_local_amount":1033.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":258636},{"amount":100,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2008-08-06T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-28T19:43:12Z","rounded_local_amount":1033.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287390},{"amount":100,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2008-09-06T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-09-12T07:04:39Z","rounded_local_amount":1033.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":317674},{"amount":100,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2008-10-06T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-09T07:04:42Z","rounded_local_amount":1033.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":349587},{"amount":100,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2008-11-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-15T18:09:28Z","rounded_local_amount":1033.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5279563},{"amount":100,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2008-12-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-21T08:54:19Z","rounded_local_amount":1033.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9891340}],"funded_date":"2008-06-06T12:23:39Z","paid_date":"2009-02-21T08:54:19Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":55479,"name":"Faafetai","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Faafetai V., 37, is married with 3 children.

Este es el primer pr\u00e9stamo que tiene con MFP, en el cual se compromete en pagar las cuotas con responsabilidad; los integrantes de su banco comunal la han nombrado secretaria, cargo que asume con mucha responsabilidad. El dinero que solicita es para la compra de fertilizantes para su chacra de caf\u00e9, para apurar su cosecha para esta campa\u00f1a.","en":"Norma is 34 years old, the mother of two children and lives in her in-laws\u00b4 house. Some years ago she only grew bananas and citrus fruits. Since living with her husband she has incremented her crops and grows coffee in some rented fields, where she is charged 150 soles for each harvest. Growing this product is very hard; once it is harvested it has to be washed, later spead out on the ground to dry, later toasted and finally ground. But it has turned out to be very profitable because they supply a business which places orders every week once the harvest begins. They take advantage of those times during which they accumulate earnings to buy school uniforms and supplies for their children and clothing for themselves. Norma likes farming because there are times when they have good earnings. She is thinking about increasing her coffee crops so she can increase her output. This is her first loan with MFP, for which she commits to making repayments responsibly. The members of the communal bank have named her secretary, a position she assumes with great responsibility. The money she request is to buy fertilizers for her coffee crops so she can accelerate her harvest this season.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Molly Puglisi, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":290833,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Buy fertilizers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-03-22T15:20:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":175,"lender_count":4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Norma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-03-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2009-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2009-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2009-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2009-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2009-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":85}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.05},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.05},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.05},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.05},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.05},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":29.04,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2009-04-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:45:15Z","rounded_local_amount":91.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36012244},{"amount":29.05,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T01:00:27Z","rounded_local_amount":91.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44595826},{"amount":29.05,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2009-06-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:39:46Z","rounded_local_amount":91.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52990093},{"amount":29.06,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2009-07-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:41:45Z","rounded_local_amount":91.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63211224},{"amount":29.05,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2009-08-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:21:34Z","rounded_local_amount":91.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73640734},{"amount":29.75,"local_amount":85,"processed_date":"2009-09-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:33:07Z","rounded_local_amount":94.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87080207}],"funded_date":"2009-03-22T15:24:10Z","paid_date":"2009-10-15T23:33:07Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Molly Puglisi","image":null}},{"id":100554,"name":"Lesina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lesina I., 41, is married with 4 children.

He is 38 years old, married, and is the father of 2 children who are 9 and 13 and both attend school. Aside from his own family, he also supports 3 nephews. He studied until the 6th grade but had to stop because of the war. He lives with his family in his own home.  <p\/>\r\n<p\/>\r\nGeraldo left Zavala for Maputo with his family when he was 16 to take refuge from the civil war that ended in 1992. He arrived in Maputo and worked with his cousin as a driver for a tram for 10 years. Later on he found a job with the gas station Petromoc (Petroleum of Mozambique) where he continues to work today. \r\n\r\n<p\/><p\/>\r\n\r\nAside from this work and as his monthly salary is 5.000,00MT, with which he supports his family, he has a business selling tires. He buys the tires at 1.350,00MT and sells them for 1.950,00MT and he earns a good return which he saves in the bank. \r\n<p\/><p\/>\r\nHe has never taken out a loan with another bank and this is his 4th loan with Hluvuku-Adsema in the amount of 15.000,00MT to buy and sell the tires and other accessories. He learned of the institution through his friends and neighbors who are also clients. The first loans he took were used for the same purpose and were for the amounts of 7.500,00MT, 15.000,00MT, and 25.000,00MT, respectively. \r\n\r\n<p\/><p\/>\r\n\r\nHe plans to pay back the loans without problems to be able to have access to more loans to finance his dream of improving his services, constructing a conventional establishment, including a car wash. \r\n\r\n<br

She lives in a house she owns, along with her husband Francisco who is 32 years old and her son Ubaldo who is 6.  What she wishes for the most is to give them a good life.  In her small home built of adobe, she knits small, cute little dolls out of wool that she takes to sell in the city of Puno where there are many tourists who appreciate her work and buy her product very quickly as they are a wonderful keepsake to take back home.  What she enjoys most about her work is the knitting, an activity that fills her with satisfaction since she knows it will provide food for her family.  She has been in this business for 2 years, and she considers the most difficult part having to be gone the entire day to sell her wares, which makes her very tired.  For this reason, she hopes to \u2013 in time \u2013 establish her business in a stable place where she doesn\u2019t have to travel to market her dolls.  She would like to provide an education for her beloved son.  Dionisia has had 5 loans with MFP by now, and she has been very punctual with her payments.  She has never had any problems with her cooperative bank, where she is in charge of installments and her good humor makes her colleagues very happy.  With the three hundred soles she is requesting, she will purchase more yarn to increase the quantity of little dolls she knits. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Mary Lynn Malaby, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":125,"image":{"id":379490,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Weaving","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"To purchase yarn.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Juliaca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15.5 -70.133333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-08-29T12:40:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":125,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Dionisia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-08-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":300,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":50}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.84},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.84},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":20.83,"local_amount":50,"processed_date":"2009-09-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:35:50Z","rounded_local_amount":61.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87081267},{"amount":20.84,"local_amount":50,"processed_date":"2009-10-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:06:15Z","rounded_local_amount":61.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96997418},{"amount":20.83,"local_amount":50,"processed_date":"2009-11-11T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:54:22Z","rounded_local_amount":61.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103842763},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":150,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T15:24:28Z","rounded_local_amount":185,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734340}],"funded_date":"2009-08-29T14:05:11Z","paid_date":"2010-01-15T15:24:29Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":137469,"name":"Charlotte","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"A.

He and his wife and two children live in their own home.  He works at his business every day, raising and selling pork. His product is very sought out in the market because the livestock are always well nourished and large in size. Every day since very early in the morning he wakes to feed the livestock to make them grow. He attends to them with a great deal of care because he knows that it is thanks to them that he will earn the income to support his family.  During the 8 years he has been running this business he had to battle against swine flu incidents, damaging his business and depleting his sales. But today the situation has improved considerably, and to maintain it he has been careful to feed them well.  In the future he hopes to set up corrals so that he may keep larger numbers of livestock. This is the third loan he has requested from Elizabet en MFP (Kiva Field Partner) and he is committed to make his payments on time.  With this loan he hopes to purchase more feed for the livestock and also to purchase two more pigs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Erika Lindig, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":578929,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To purchase two pigs and feed.

Finishing her college education, Rosemarie is ever determined to break people's low expectations of her. She is married to Henry, an auto welder. They were blessed with two children, one of whom is currently employed and the other one is in tertiary education now.\r\n\r\nRosemarie's home serves both as an abode of rest and a venue for business, because at her home she has set up a sari-sari (variety) store to earn a living. She sells a wide range of products to the neighborhood, which includes items from rice and noodles to detergent powder and soap bars. With this, Rosemarie earns a net average of 400 Philippines pesos (Php) per day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operation of her business, she is requesting a 20,000 (Php) loan. Adding more products to her store is a priority for her to improve her business, and the money from the loan would certainly be used to purchase these additional products. She looks forward to making the store grow and eventually expand.\r\n\r\nAt present, Rosemarie finds it hard to follow up with customers who do not pay their debts on time. But just like any other hardworking entrepreneur, Evelyn sees to it that no challenge will  ever wear her out. She dreams of having a progressive life with her children and being financially stable as well.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital and pay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":652740,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

She lives in  District 1, Brooke's Point, Palawan. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2007 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her business, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She currently earns an average monthly income of PHP 6,000. For her 6th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Marivic is now borrowing PHP 18,000 in order to continue funding the operations of the butcher shop. Her previous loan of PHP 15,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Marivic hopes to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the  Dungganon way. \r\n\r\n<p>About NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

He has 5 children, from one- to ten-years old.  He has worked along with his wife, with whom he has managed to build a successful business renting washing machines and selling washing soap and clothing, over the last two years.  He lives with his family in Carrizal, a neighborhood famous for its Carnivale celebration and for the music that is practically a way of life among the residents.  Rodolfo knows the neighborhood well and he's shaped his business to meet the needs that he sees.  He used to buy on credit himself so he identifies with his customers, normal people from the neighborhood who are often relatives and friends.  Rodolfo describes himself as responsible and serious.  He approached the Fundacion Mario Santo Domino for a low-cost loan to pay off another higher-interest loan.  His average monthly sales are COP$1,000,000 and his margin is 50%.  He will use this loan from Kiva to buy a washing machine so that he can meet growing demand for his washing machine rental business.  He will also pay cash for miscellaneous merchandise that he will buy in bulk.  Rodolfo's dream is to buy a house for his family.  He wants to continue expanding his business, something he can do with each new Fundacion loan.  Rodolfo is happy that he can borrow from Kiva because his greatest challenge before was finding funds to expand his business.  Once he establishes himself as a borrower with Kiva, he can start building a credit history."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":702852,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Machinery Rental","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"Buy a washing machine and other merchandise for rental business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2011-01-29T17:00:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rodolfo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":600000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":53088},{"due_date":"2011-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":56023},{"due_date":"2011-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":57096},{"due_date":"2011-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":58191},{"due_date":"2011-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":59306},{"due_date":"2011-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":60443},{"due_date":"2011-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":61601},{"due_date":"2011-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":62782},{"due_date":"2011-11-05T07:00:00Z","amount":63985},{"due_date":"2011-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":67485}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.76},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.34},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.93},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.52},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.12},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.74},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.37},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.01},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.66},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.55}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":28.76,"local_amount":53088,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:08:19Z","rounded_local_amount":53543.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201289249},{"amount":30.34,"local_amount":56023,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:04:28Z","rounded_local_amount":56503.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206157388},{"amount":30.93,"local_amount":57096,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:18:20Z","rounded_local_amount":57586.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211230397},{"amount":31.52,"local_amount":58191,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:09:10Z","rounded_local_amount":58690.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216509260},{"amount":203.45,"local_amount":375602,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:50:21Z","rounded_local_amount":378825.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221673481}],"funded_date":"2011-01-29T19:39:55Z","paid_date":"2011-08-15T08:50:21Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jere Wiseman","image":30736}},{"id":273490,"name":"Razel","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Razel M. is from the village of Tuod, Manticao, Misamis Oriental.

She earns her living by operating a fishing\/fish vending business. Her husband Nilo, who is 56 years old, works as a fisherman to earn his living and helps in his wife's business activities. They have six children who are 9 to 25 years old. Perlita joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2001 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 12 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Perlita has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 19,500 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 10,000, thus uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her 13th loan, she is borrowing PHP 25,000 to purchase fishing equipment so that she can continue to save up for the future and her children's education. Perlita is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

With a lot of experience in breeding cattle, but no capital, she was not able to achieve much success until joining TYM in 2001.  Her breeding pigs project has achieved a lot of success in the last 7 years and she has been able to breed buffalo and cows as well.  Currently, her four children are all grown up and have their own lives.  Her husband is the main helper with the breeding now.  With 4 million VND monthly income, she has never had any problem with repaying the loan.  For this cycle, she would like to borrow 15 million VND to invest more into this project.\r\n\r\n<p><b>Translated from Vietnamese by Anh H.

She doesn't need to invest too much money in it because she produces the feed which she gives to her animals herself.  In the future, she would like to have more cows and other animals to raise.\r\n\r\nThis is Teva's first loan with MFP and she is happy to know that she has financial support.  She also likes being a member of her community bank because all the members are people that she knows.  They are all responsible and very supportive of each other.\r\n\r\nTeva is grateful to the people who will fund her loan as it will be very useful to her in making progress in her business.  She will invest her loan money in buying some sheep.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":678283,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy sheep","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"HUANCAYO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.066667 -75.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-12-26T17:20:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":250,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Teva ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-11-29T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":700,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":700}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":250,"local_amount":700,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:34:07Z","rounded_local_amount":700.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216549670}],"funded_date":"2010-12-26T19:24:18Z","paid_date":"2011-07-15T11:34:07Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Oxnard","image":null}},{"id":265311,"name":"Rizalito","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rizalito D. is from the village of Tagdo, Mambajao, Camiguin Province.

She lives in Manapla, Negros Occidental. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2002 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her fishing\/fish vending business, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 10,000. Ma. Lida is borrowing PHP 13,000 so that she can fund her business operations. This will be her 22nd loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 15,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Ma. Lida aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future wellbeing by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Ella es una joven muy emprendedora con muchos deseos de superaci\u00f3n y de ver a su hija en mejores condiciones a las que ella ha tenido.

Este negocio es la principal fuente de ingresos de Ayde ya que la situaci\u00f3n de su esposo no es estable y hay algunos meses que no recibe remesas ya que su esposo no cuenta con un trabajo fijo en el pa\u00eds en que se encuentra.

Esto la motivo a solicitar este cr\u00e9dito a INTEGRAL para invertir en su tienda en la compra de variedad de productos tales como: verduras, arroz, az\u00facar, frijoles, pan dulce, bebidas, detergente, golosinas. Etc. Sinceramente espera poder mejorar su calidad de vida y la de su familia. \n\n","en":"Ayde Esperanza, 27 years old, lives in her home with her dear daughter Liliana who's 7 years old. The reason that Ayde lives alone is because her life partner emigrated to the United States several years ago and with the help of his arduous work she has been able to stay afloat. She is a very entrepreneurial young person with a great desire for self-improvement and seeing her daughter in better conditions than those which she has had. Several years ago she managed to establish a small store in her home residence from which she sells a diversity of products like: candy, oil, sweet bread, cereals, vegetables, shoes, and many other things. This business is the main source of income for Ayde since her husband's situation is not stable and there are some months when she doesn't receive a remittance of money as her husband is not able to rely on a permanent job in the country in which he finds himself. She has been thinking a lot about how to make her store grow and manage to increase the level in sales as for the time being this is the only way to manage to support herself economically. This motivated her to apply to Integral for a loan in order to invest in her store purchasing a variety products such as: vegetables, rice, sugar, beans, sweet bread, drinks, detergent, candy, etc. She sincerely hopes to be able to better her quality of life and that of her family.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":876780,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy a variety of products like: vegetables, rice, sugar, beans, sweet bread, drinks, detergent, candies, etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":81,"posted_date":"2011-09-24T18:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":500,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ayde Esperanza","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-09-06T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":34.23},{"due_date":"2011-11-06T07:00:00Z","amount":34.91},{"due_date":"2011-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":36.71},{"due_date":"2012-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":37.58},{"due_date":"2012-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":39},{"due_date":"2012-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":41.19},{"due_date":"2012-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":41.97},{"due_date":"2012-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":43.81},{"due_date":"2012-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":45.15},{"due_date":"2012-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":46.99},{"due_date":"2012-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":48.56},{"due_date":"2012-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":49.9}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.23},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.91},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.71},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.58},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.19},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.97},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.81},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.15},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.99},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.56},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.9}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":38.34,"local_amount":38.34,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T09:20:17Z","rounded_local_amount":38.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238546120},{"amount":38.04,"local_amount":38.04,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:12:59Z","rounded_local_amount":38.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244505709},{"amount":36.99,"local_amount":36.99,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T09:16:41Z","rounded_local_amount":36.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250713185},{"amount":37.87,"local_amount":37.87,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T09:27:56Z","rounded_local_amount":37.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257116038},{"amount":39.3,"local_amount":39.3,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T08:28:26Z","rounded_local_amount":39.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263241152},{"amount":309.46,"local_amount":309.46,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T08:24:20Z","rounded_local_amount":309.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":269966102}],"funded_date":"2011-09-27T10:04:19Z","paid_date":"2012-04-15T08:24:20Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Shannon Birk","image":null}},{"id":343194,"name":"New Horizons [Nuevos Horizontes] Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Aracely Feliciana es casada, tiene 28 a\u00f1os D. edad, curs\u00f3 los grados D. estudios primarios, tiene 2 hijos 1 D. los cuales estudia, se dedica ala tejedur\u00eda D. telas t\u00edpicas: servilletas, cortes, y sabanas; inici\u00f3 este trabajo como operaria y hasta el momento lleva 12 a\u00f1os D. experiencia, cuenta con el poyo D. su esposo quien se dedica al mismo trabajo.\n\nOrganiza un grupo con el fin D. solicitar un pr\u00e9stamo que servir\u00e1 para la compra D. materiales: hilos y labores D. diferentes dise\u00f1os y colores, el el futuro espera contar con suficiente capital y mejorar sus ingresos.

The older daughter is married and lives separately with her family, two daughters are at school, the older son works in construction, and the younger one is a farmer.\r\n\r\nIn order to earn money to meet their daily needs, this family breeds cattle. At the moment they keep four cows and Jyparkul sells about 50-60 liters of milk a day. In this way she earns about 12,000 soms per month.

They have been able to slowly build their home out of hard work, although it is still admittedly in need of much improvement. Maria has a 7 year old daughter who she works hard to feed and educate. Her husband is a field worker who is mostly employed in big farms outside of their town. Meanwhile, Maria tends to their own piece of land with the help of Mario whenever he is out of work or she really needs him. They hope to invest in fertilizer and pesticides to preserve the crops they have already planted. <\/p>\r\n<h4>Communal Banking in Baba<\/h4> \r\n<p>This borrower is part of one the new Communal Banks formed in the recently developed Mifex Rural Finance Program. All of the members of the Anzuelo Baba Communal Bank are part of an association of rice farmers in the county of Baba in rural Ecuador. Their organization, El Anzuelo Asociacion, works cooperatively to help their members cultivate rice and commercialize the product after it has grown. Most recently, El Anzuelo was able to start a program that improved their members access to watering services.  \r\n<\/p> \r\n<p>The members of La Asociacion El Anzuelo de Baba will use the micro-loans to prepare their lands and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each other\u2019s guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many micro-finance programs, but Mifex believes that is imperative for the communities we work with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties. <\/p> \r\n<p><i>Below is more information about Baba compiled by Luis Crespo and Robert Edgar of the Mifex team when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. <\/i><\/p> \r\n<h4>Economy of Baba<\/h4> \r\n<p>The people of Baba have been organized since the days of Gran Colombia when Ecuador was yet to be a country. The area has always been popular because of the extremely productive lands that gave way to cultivation of cacao for decades. Now Baba is a county in the province of Los Rios in the coastal region of Ecuador. For most of the latter part of the 20th Century it was a cacao and banana producing sector. Most of the surrounding areas of Baba in Los Rios are owned by large mulitnational  \r\ncompanies such as Dole, but Baba is a sector characterized by the small and informal farms. <\/p>\r\n<p>Rice production has now turned into the main economic activity of the sector as about 80% of the people are rice farmers. Cacao is still very popular in the area, but because of the long cultivation cycle people prefer to invest in rice. The lands in Baba are very fertile though, and most farmers in the sector often grow other crops, such as plantains and soy beans  \r\nas secondary sources of income.  Many farmers also keep livestock as emergency sources of food and income, commonly resorting to selling a chicken or pig if they are in need of cash. <\/p> \r\n<h4>Rice Farming in Baba<\/h4> \r\n<p>Most of the people in the Baba area are small farmers. They produce about 80 sacks of rice per hectare of land. In order to farm they first must prepare the lands by removing weeds, plowing and leveling the lands. This is the most difficult part for the farmers in Baba, who often lack the necessary machinery to properly plow the lands for rice production. After appropriately preparing the lands, the farmers fill an area with water to form what is known as a paddy field, because rice is a very water intensive crop. The rice seeds are either dispersed freely (the process is known as boleo in Spanish) or hand sowed. Once the rice has grown, most farmers rent machinery that helps them gather their production. <\/p> \r\n<h4>Access to Credit<\/h4> \r\n<p>One of the biggest struggles in the area has been the lack of credit due to the absence of any type of financial institution. \r\nBecause people do not count on formal financing, they have turned to loan sharks, paying between 100% and 240% annual interest.  Intermediaries also exploit the farmers because of their outstanding debt. Farmers also lack skills and knowledge to commercialize their products and earn fair prices for their crops. <\/p> \r\n<h4>Risks<\/h4> \r\n<p>The largest risk in the sector is due to absence of watering systems. Although Baba is in the province \u201cLos Rios\u201d (the rivers) there is a severe problem with access to water. The lack of infrastructure in the sector does not allow the small farmers to benefit from the presence of the many rivers in the area. If the winter season is too dry, it is likely that the lands will not be sufficiently fertile for rice production in the summer. On the other hand, if there is too much rain there are not any drainage systems to prevent flooding and the crops are often ruined. Generally speaking though, Baba is a very productive sector where the lands yield all types of crops including rice, cacao, corn, watermelons, plantains, and soy beans. <\/p> \r\n<h4>Loan Use<\/h4> \r\n<p>The loans in this sector will mostly be used to to buy soil, seeds, fertilizer and insecticides. Many clients will use the capital towards renting machinery and equipment necessary to effectively work and prepare the fields. Clients also typically use a part of the loan to buy livestock in order to raise and have as reserves. The loan repayment schedule is different from the typical micro-entrepreneur because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures. Mifex asks our rural clients only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 6 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the seventh and final month. <\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":825,"image":{"id":37001,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Rice farming.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Baba","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-1.783333 -79.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":7,"posted_date":"2007-05-28T02:48:14Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":825,"lender_count":26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-06-11T18:16:09Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":825,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":825,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2007-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2007-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2007-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2007-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2007-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":137.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2008-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":137.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":66,"local_amount":66,"processed_date":"2007-06-16T17:00:06Z","settlement_date":"2008-05-15T09:23:23Z","rounded_local_amount":66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":23691},{"amount":66,"local_amount":66,"processed_date":"2007-07-17T21:39:42Z","settlement_date":"2008-05-15T09:23:23Z","rounded_local_amount":66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":33125},{"amount":633,"local_amount":633,"processed_date":"2007-12-18T18:24:36Z","settlement_date":"2008-05-15T09:23:23Z","rounded_local_amount":633,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":99068},{"amount":60,"local_amount":60,"processed_date":"2008-05-14T17:00:25Z","settlement_date":"2008-05-15T09:23:23Z","rounded_local_amount":60,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":210202}],"funded_date":"2007-05-28T18:16:09Z","paid_date":"2008-05-14T17:00:25Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":14546,"name":"Anonymous","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":""}},"status":"defaulted","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":726677,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Hellen would like to buy 2 steers","delinquent":true,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":6,"posted_date":"2007-07-21T20:15:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Anonymous","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-08-04T21:05:39Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":375,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2007-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2007-11-04T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2007-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2008-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2008-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2008-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2007-07-21T21:05:39Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":18642,"name":"Ilda Leonor Paulo","description":{"languages":["pt"],"texts":{"pt":"Location: Guachene area  \u2013 Catembe<BR>\r\nClient: Ilda Leonor Paulo M.<BR>\r\nActivity: Retail<BR>\r\nLoan amount: 10,000 Mozambique Meticais (MT) (US$ 400.00)<BR>\r\nUse: Purchase products for resale<BR>\r\nStart date: 08\/16\/2007<BR> \r\nEnd date: 11\/07\/2008<p>\r\n\r\nIlda Leonor Paulo M. was born in Maputo in 1966.

When he arrived to set up home in the area, few people lived there, and therefore business was at a minimum. Seeing that so many of his neighbours, just like him, had to walk quite a way before finding any shops, he decided to open up his own small shop. Little by little, and with a lot of hard work, Arturo improved his shop and invested in it until he was able to supply groceries, fruit and veg. He confirms that it was very hard to start with, and accessing his house was difficult for suppliers. And so he had to carry goods from the road to his house. But he chose not to give up despite this problem, he felt that the advantages of the business were not only for him but also for the community.

He is a baker.  His workday begins very early in the morning, at about 4:30am, when he gets up to start kneading the dough and making the bread which everyone in the neighborhood enjoys.  Adolfo is a very skilled baker because he learned the craft as a little boy from his father.  What he most likes about the job is baking bread which he does with great care.  He has had this occupation for 30 years and he considers the most difficult part having to get up so early in the morning every day since for him there is no such thing as weekends or holidays.  For later in the future, he would like to set up a store to sell the bread that he himself bakes.  This is his first loan with MFP and he doesn't want to fail to repay it for lack of money so he is willing to save day by day to repay it.  Besides, he is very responsible and respectful toward the other members.

They live together in the town of Santa Rosa, located in Ayacucho's tropical rainforest, where they have their own house.\r\n\r\nIt all began when her parents gave her a small plot of land so she could work and grow cocoa and coffee, but she never thought that she would like it so much.  Once she reached adulthood, her parents gave Alejandra her independence, and of course her parents were keeping an eye on their daughter's progress.  Now she sells to the big wholesalers in her town, who give her a good profit margin with respect to her previous sales.  At any rate, she is grateful to her parents for the good lessons they gave her.\r\n\r\nAlejandra generally receives help from her husband, but at harvest time she needs hired workers to help her get her products to the sales points and sell at a competitive price.  Her future plans are to expand her production so that she can earn more income.\r\n\r\nThis is her fifth loan with MFP, and she promises to continue paying on schedule.  Besides, she is happy with her communal bank, as it gives her many benefits.  Alejandra is thinking of investing the requested loan in maintenance for her cocoa fields, with the goal of preventing anything that could adversely affect their production.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Danielle Maxson, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":578979,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Maintenance of cocoa fields","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-08-06T01:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":725,"lender_count":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alejandra ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-07-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":725}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":725,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T04:41:35Z","rounded_local_amount":2042.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191463061}],"funded_date":"2010-08-06T17:52:38Z","paid_date":"2011-02-16T04:41:35Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":224346,"name":"Francisca","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La Sra.

She earns her living by operating two business ventures:  tailoring and a general store business.  Her husband Francisco, who is 66 years old, works as a farmer to earn his living and helps in his wife's business activities.  They have 12 children who are between 11 and 41 years old. Purita joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2002 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 27 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Purita has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 26,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 12,000,  uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 28th loan, she is borrowing PHP 28,000, to buy materials and equipment for tailoring and stock for her store so that she can continue to save up for her children's future education and to get a better job.

She lives in the city of Cartagena, where she has a store called \u201cThe Thrifty One\u201d.  Its name honors the low prices at which she offers her products, while still making a profit for herself.\r\n\r\nHer customers live in her neighborhood and areas near her business, where she offers food, supplies and beverages at retail.  Antonia knows her business very well since she knows that, when she buys in bulk volumes, she makes a better profit than when buying supplies little by little.  This is the reason she turns to Kiva credit, as it will allow her to buy products in larger quantities and therefore at discounts that she can then pass along to her customers.  She wants them to be happy and to continue to buy from her.

He has been working as an independent farmer for the last five years, the same kind of work he has done since he was a child helping his parents. Every day he checks his fields to make sure his crops are free from pests. Recently he applied insecticiD. (the used bags are shown in the photo). He grows a range of the crops best suited to the area.\r\nHansen knows that profit from agriculture is realised after six months, so he has found a temporary job to earn money during that time. He works in the local municipality office in the afternoons. Currently he has more projects in development, one of which is investing in a new business to improve crop production.

She lives in her father's house, who she wants to give a tranquil old age.  What she wants most is to get ahead in life.  For Petronila, livestock husbandry is an activity that comes from her family as she learned how to do it from a young age. She currently carries out this work and is very good at doing it.  Her livestock is very sought after in the Huancane and Juliaca markets. What she most likes about her work is to graze her animals and to be outside in the fresh air.  She has been doing this activity for 15 years and the most difficult part for her is to take her animals to the different markets to sell them. In the future she hopes to increase her number of heads of livestock  to improve her income. This is Petronila\u2019s first loan with MFP and she feels happy about the opportunity it provides. In her communal bank she is a much loved member as she always helps in everything required.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  Today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nTajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged an already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients present a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Her husband makes furniture for a living, and they have three children who are studying.  She has a shop where she sells diapers.\r\n\r\nWhen she saw that the women in her area needed a place to buy disposable diapers for their children, Diana decided to invest her savings in diapers and sell them to people she knew.  Little by little and with much effort and dedication, she acquired a space and converted it into a store to sell diapers and other baby items.\r\n\r\nIn order to make her business more profitable, Diana would like to use her loan to buy diapers, bottles, and other items for babies.  In the future, she would like to expand her business and open multiple branches.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Mairead Harris, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":554806,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Purchase of diapers and baby bottles","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Guayaquil (Suburbio)","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":147,"posted_date":"2010-06-16T11:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":700,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Diana Espinoza","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-06-09T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":700,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":65.31},{"due_date":"2010-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":64.21},{"due_date":"2010-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":65.7},{"due_date":"2010-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":67.6},{"due_date":"2010-11-05T07:00:00Z","amount":68.79},{"due_date":"2010-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":70.66},{"due_date":"2011-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":72.02},{"due_date":"2011-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":73.69},{"due_date":"2011-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":75.74},{"due_date":"2011-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":76.28}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.31},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.21},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.7},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":67.6},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.79},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.66},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.02},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.69},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.74},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.28}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":65.31,"local_amount":65.31,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:10:04Z","rounded_local_amount":65.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159631939},{"amount":64.21,"local_amount":64.21,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:14:21Z","rounded_local_amount":64.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166845825},{"amount":65.48,"local_amount":65.48,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:06:46Z","rounded_local_amount":65.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172112099},{"amount":67.82,"local_amount":67.82,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T13:56:39Z","rounded_local_amount":67.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177405505},{"amount":68.79,"local_amount":68.79,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T14:05:29Z","rounded_local_amount":68.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182543980},{"amount":70.66,"local_amount":70.66,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T13:08:05Z","rounded_local_amount":70.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188680735},{"amount":72.02,"local_amount":72.02,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T01:46:14Z","rounded_local_amount":72.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191379074},{"amount":73.69,"local_amount":73.69,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:24:30Z","rounded_local_amount":73.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195797069},{"amount":75.74,"local_amount":75.74,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T10:21:22Z","rounded_local_amount":75.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201239243},{"amount":76.28,"local_amount":76.28,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-19T07:45:48Z","rounded_local_amount":76.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206105696}],"funded_date":"2010-06-27T12:50:46Z","paid_date":"2011-05-19T07:45:48Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Mairead Harris","image":500788}},{"id":212072,"name":"Otgonbayar","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Shirnen Otgonbayar is 39 years old and lives with her five children in Darkhan province, one of Mongolia's big provinces.

With the children\u2019s help, she processes the oil into soap, which she then sells at the local weekly markets. \r\n\r\nWith her loan, she will buy barrels of oil to be used in soap making.\r\n\r\nHer goal is to bolster her income in order to meet her personal needs and better provide for the children in her care.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Nathalie Pelletier, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3475,"image":{"id":594497,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Develop and promote her business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SN","country":"Senegal","town":"Agence de Ziguinchor","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"14 -14","type":"point"}},"partner_id":105,"posted_date":"2010-09-03T15:40:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":3475,"lender_count":78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Awa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Balakiss","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Taye","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fanseyni","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Awa Meta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nounmou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Abibatou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maryse","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-08-09T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":1770000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":3475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":1770000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":3475}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":3475,"local_amount":1770000,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T08:26:21Z","rounded_local_amount":1782344.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195813988}],"funded_date":"2010-09-07T05:12:37Z","paid_date":"2011-03-24T08:26:21Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":232558,"name":"Peter Macharia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Peter has been in the motorcycle transport business since 2008.

and selling household appliances. She lives in Purok Doridad, Brgy Plaridel, Sagay City, Negros Occidental. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2004 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. \r\n\r\nBy working hard in her buying and selling of household appliances, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 4000. Leah is now borrowing PHP 21,000 to use as additional working capital for the business.  This will be her 11th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 19,500, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Leah aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed on a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

So, in order to financially assist her family, she makes embroidered clothes and also sells cloth. She buys clothes from the markets of Multan and sells them to her local area clients for good profit. Basically, she is a very creative lady and loves to craft beautiful embroidered dresses. She sells her embroidered dresses to different boutiques and people admire her talent and give her good orders.  \r\n\r\nSaeeda is also a very good wife and mother. She is married to F. who also has a business of embroidery. She is bringing up her 6 children with great care. Her elder son does his own business, while her remaining children are getting their education. \r\n\r\nSaeeda has applied for a loan from Kiva partner Asasah in order to improve her clothes selling business. She will utilize the loan to purchase clothes in bulk quantity that will help her offer more variety to her clients and make more sales. She is hopeful that, in this way, she will be able to make more money and provide better living facilities to her family. \r\n\r\nNote: In the photo, the lady with a book (called Asasah Passbook) is
