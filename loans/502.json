She is widowed and has six children, four of whom are currently in school. For the past five years, Fatuma has been working hard to manage her business, in which she sells maize and produce. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Fatuma has requested a loan of 2,000,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more bags of maize, and will help Fatuma to generate greater profits and transition into selling wholesale. Fatuma hopes that in the future she will be able to open other wholesale businesses. \r\n\r\nFatuma is a member of BRAC's Small Enterprise Program (SEP).  The program primarily serves small business entrepreneurs like Fatuma who do not have enough collateral for commercial loans, but have businesses that have grown too large for microloans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":904795,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

He would like to borrow 5,000,000 SLL to purchase the following items: large quantities of used clothes, trousers, bed spreads, shoes, carpets, and  handbags. He is friendly and accommodating.

They will use these microloans to prepare their lands and cultivate rice on their farms. As members of a communal bank, they are all the guarantors for each other's loans. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the Dios con Nosotros Cooperative are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many microfinance programs, but Mifex believes that is imperative for the communities we works with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Below is more information about the commnity of Santa Lucia, compiled by Luis Crespo and Robert Edgar of the Mifex team when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. Special thanks to Mario Balazantegui who provided expert insight and contributed to the development of the alliances with the local organizations. <\/em><\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Economy of Santa Lucia<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Santa Lucia County has a population of about 33,000 people. The region is fit for rice cultivating because it is not in the lowlands and therefore it is not at risk of flooding. There is also great access to water because of the Daule River, which is accessible to many of the farmers in the area. About 70% of the farmers have basic infrastructure for watering their crops. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rice production is the main economic activity of the area, as about 80% of the people are rice farmers. Almost everyone is either directly or indirectly involved with the rice production, as they produce, commercialize or participate in activities that add value to the product. Within the county, there is a small town also named Santa Lucia. The town is filled with many small businesses and it serves as the social and commercial hub of the area.  <\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Rice Farming in Santa Lucia<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Most of the people in the Santa Lucia area are small farmers. They produce about 100 sacks of rice per hectare of land. In order to farm they first must prepare the lands by removing weeds and plowing. The farmers then fill an area with water to form what is known as a paddy field, because rice is a very water intensive crop. The rice seeds are either dispersed freely (the process is known as <i>boleo<\/i> in Spanish) or hand sowed. Once the rice has grown, most farmers rent machinery that helps them harvest their crop. A risk factor does exist in rice farming because of drought, but in Santa Lucia this is somewhat mitigated by the access to water form the nearby river.  <\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Access to Credit<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The biggest struggle in the area has been the lack of credit. Because people do not have access to formal financial services, they have turned to loan sharks for financing. They have been affected by expensive lines of credit that exceed 100% interest a year and can be as expensive as 240%. Intermediaries also exploit the farmers because of their outstanding debt. Farmers also often lack skills and knowledge of how to commercialize their product and get fair prices for their crops.  <\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Loan Use<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The loans in this sector will be used to to buy soil, seeds, fertilizer and insecticides. They will also be used to prepare the land prior to farming, to plant the seeds and purchase other materials. The loan repayment schedule is different from the typical microentrepreneur. Because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures, Mifex asks them to repay 50% of the capital in the first 6 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the seventh and final month. <\/p> "}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":925,"image":{"id":19431,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Farm Rice","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Santa Lucia","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.183333 -80","type":"point"}},"partner_id":7,"posted_date":"2007-03-13T19:29:23Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":925,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Benito","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-03-29T14:20:04Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":925,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-04-29T07:00:00Z","amount":132.14},{"due_date":"2007-05-29T07:00:00Z","amount":132.14},{"due_date":"2007-06-29T07:00:00Z","amount":132.14},{"due_date":"2007-07-29T07:00:00Z","amount":132.14},{"due_date":"2007-08-29T07:00:00Z","amount":132.14},{"due_date":"2007-09-29T07:00:00Z","amount":132.14},{"due_date":"2007-10-29T07:00:00Z","amount":132.16}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":132.14},{"due_date":"2007-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":132.14},{"due_date":"2007-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":132.14},{"due_date":"2007-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":132.14},{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":132.14},{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":132.14},{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":132.16}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":74,"local_amount":74,"processed_date":"2007-05-17T21:35:50Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-10T23:26:49Z","rounded_local_amount":74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":16566},{"amount":74,"local_amount":74,"processed_date":"2007-06-09T17:33:53Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-10T23:26:49Z","rounded_local_amount":74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":21970},{"amount":74,"local_amount":74,"processed_date":"2007-07-05T20:17:02Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-10T23:26:49Z","rounded_local_amount":74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":29283},{"amount":74,"local_amount":74,"processed_date":"2007-08-06T23:45:46Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-10T23:26:49Z","rounded_local_amount":74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":39726},{"amount":74,"local_amount":74,"processed_date":"2007-09-11T21:04:33Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-10T23:26:49Z","rounded_local_amount":74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53275},{"amount":555,"local_amount":555,"processed_date":"2007-10-10T20:08:16Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-10T23:26:49Z","rounded_local_amount":555,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":65646}],"funded_date":"2007-03-15T14:20:04Z","paid_date":"2007-10-10T20:08:16Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":10562,"name":"Shahin","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Shahin N. is a native of the Aghsu region of Azerbaijan.

To ensure the longterm survival of her family and to help relieve some of the burden of her hard work, she hopes to get another loan to help increase her family's income.  Although already older in her years, as the wife of I Made Ardana, she must continue to farm pigs with as much energy as if she were newly married.  Little by little her savings grows thanks to the pigs she is able to sell.  She and her husband also save the money that her husband earns as a farm laborer on someone else's land.  Their system of saving has already helped them to purchase their own piece of land.  During her first loan from Kiva\/Dinari Ni Nyoman Dewi received 1,400,000 Rupiah which she used to purchase 3 piglets.  She was able to sell them for 3,500,000 Rupiah, netting her a profit of 1,200,000 Rupiah over 6 months, or 200,000 Rupiah\/month.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Her brother and sister in-law died in 1993 during the civil war so Krubo also provides for their child. Krubo\u2019s husband is a farmer but doesn\u2019t earn enough to support the family. She lives in nearby Bokeza Town in a refugee camp because the town was burned to the ground during the war.\r\n\r\nKrubo\u2019s business is dry goods, such as food, housewares and clothing, which she imports from nearby Guinea. She sells in a temporary market stall alongside approximately 100 other vendors. She is successful because her customers like her personality and customer service. Her dream is to grow her business until she can build a permanent shop.  With the profits from her business Krubo dreams of building a permanent house to raise her family and send all her children to school.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":380227,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"Purchase Inventory","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"LR","country":"Liberia","town":"Lofa Co.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from buying and selling scrap metal and other used products in the local community. Narciso has been engaged in his business for over 10 years and earns approximately 2,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Narciso joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Narciso has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase new items to expand product offering. Narciso is requesting a new loan of 7,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the 2nd loan taken out by Narciso from ASKI. He plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand his business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 29 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She also sells miscellaneous goods and sunglasses, mostly for women. \r\n\r\nThis new loan will be invested in sheets, sunglasses, miscellaneous goods and seasonal clothing.  She is a founding member of the village bank and is very grateful to the Espoir Foundation since she was able to start her business thanks to them.  Her dream is to have a shop with all of the services for her customers.

is a visionary young entrepreneur from Izum, Ukraine, who is on the pathway to success. She operates a bustling little store where she sells an attractive array of fruits and vegetables. Olga started her business as an open-air market vendor. With help from Nadiya Ukraine she was able to open a small storefront facility and gained a great competitive advantage by having a clean, indoor space to offer her selections. At her previous location she would typically earn around $20-$60 per day. With her new store, her income has increased to between $40 and as high as $180 per day.\r\n<p>\r\nOlga understands the value of customer service \u2013 a quality which sets her apart from many other business owners. She is attentive and polite to her customers and tries to give them each her individual attention.\r\n<p>\r\nOlga has requested a loan for two purposes.

Although living in a small hut with bamboo weaved walls, Ketut K. family seems to be peaceful and happy. Her husband work as a tenant farmer. He is very responsible towards his family. His hard work is not wasted by Kakek Budi, his children was able to finish high school. After marrying Ketut K. never stopped raising pigs though in very small numbers, only 1 or 2 each time, and even that done the traditional way by putting the pig on leash under a tree.\r\nMorning and evenings the pigs were fed with food obtained from the fields: leaves or talas roots that was cooked and sometimes mixed with rice shells during rice-harvest. After 3 months the pigs could be sold for Rp350,000 (about $38)\/each. With the loan to be obtained, Ketut K. will add another pig, and the rest to buy better foods like rice shells, concentrate or polar so that the pigs could grow faster. Also with the lengthy dry season reserve feed from the fields are getting difficult to obtain. With one additional pig and better feed, Ketut K. is convinced that she could get Rp300,000 (about $35)\/month nett, and this would add to daily family living expense, which average Rp20,000 (about $2.10) \/day.\r\n<p><b>Translated from Bahasa Indonesia by Gwan Liong Ang, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\nHidup rukun dan bersahaja merupakan idaman bagi setiap keluarga, walau dengan gubuk kecil yang berdindingkan gedek bambu keluarga Ketut K. kelihatan rukun dan sangat bahagia. Suaminya yang bekerja sebagai petani sangat bertanggung jawab terhadap keluarganya. kerja kerasnya ini juga tak di sia-siakan  oleh Kadek budi antara anak nya untuk menyelesaikan pendidikannya sampai tingkat SMA. Sejak menikah Ketut K. Tak pernah putus memelihara babi walau hanya dalam jumlah yang kecil yaitu 1 sampai 2 ekor saja, dan itupun dengan cara yg masih tradisional Babinya di ikat di bawah pohon, pagi dan sore ternaknya   diberi makanan yg di buat\/diperoleh dari sawah berupa daun daunan dan pohon ubi talas yg di masak. dan kadang-kadang di campur dedak kalau lagi musim panen padi. Setelah tiga bulan babinya laku di jual Rp 350.000\/ekor. Dengan pinjaman yang di dapat Ketut K. akan menambah lagi satu ekor ternaknya dan sisanya di pergunakan untuk membeli pakan yg lebih baik Seperti Dedak, Konsentrat dan juga Polar supaya ternaknya lebih cepat besar, di samping juga persediaan pakan di sawah mulai  susah didapat karena musim kemarau yg panjang. Dengan tambahan 1 ekor ternak dan pakan  yang juga berubah  sekarang Ketut K. yakin bisa mendapatkan hasil bersih panen ternaknya Rp 300.000\/ bulan, dan hasil ini cukup membantu menambah  biaya

one of the coordinators for the Bank of Hope Las Ungidas. She also looks after her three younger brothers who live with her. She plans to use her increased profits to help pay for their school which will resume in August. Using her house as a base, Nemesi plans to use this loan to expand her business of selling wallets, purses, shoes, and skirts. The capital, Santo Domingo, is about an hour away from her home in Los Alcarrizos and Nemesi plans to make bimonthly trips there to purchase her merchandise for the best price. \r\n\r\nNot only is Nemesi excited about expanding her business efforts, but she is also excited about the responsibilities associated with being a group coordinator. Esperanza International uses the Grameen model of group lending. This means that if one member in the group defaults, the other members are responsible for this portion too. Thus, it is important the group maintains a sense of solidarity and actively works through problems together. Nemesi is eager to help facilitate these conversations and unity. She described \u201csolidarity\u201d as a little word that has great meaning; that it means a group commitment to helping one another mutually attain goals and overcome obstacles. \r\n\r\n\r\nOn

The fish, whether fresh, fried, smoked or dried, will be sold in Bamako, at the Castle Market in S\u00e9gou and on location in Markala, for cash and seldom on credit, to a clientele made up of women and men.

She is 48 years old and is married to Jerry S., who works as a farmer. She has 8 children; one already has his own family, and the rest are still attending school. As a mother, she would like to secure the future of her children by making sure that they have very good jobs and enough earnings to support the needs of their own families when they decide to settle down. \r\n\r\nMa. Luz got married at only 19 years old because she wanted to be free of her parents' strictness. When she had her own family, she encountered a lot of hardships and problems on how to cope with their daily living. She knew that her husband's income as a farmer was not enough for them. When their first baby was born, Ma. Luz tried other ways to earn other income like putting up a small general store at the front of her house while raising ducks in her backyard. In spite of the additional business, they still encountered problems; still, they persevered.   \r\n\r\nIn 2001 Ma. Luz was able to join NWTF-Project Dungganon, which gave her additional capital for their business. With the loan, she was able to buy additional ducks to raise so that she could then sell the eggs to their neighbors. As loans continued, she learned how to handle her money. She was also able to invest in pig fattening, acquire a farmland and buy a water buffalo for their farm. Twenty six years later, Ma.Luz is more knowledgeable on how to manage her businesses. She now earns PHP 10,000 per month. Most of the profit is put in a savings account to support the education of their children and to help with the family expenses.\r\n\r\nFor her previous loan, Ma. Luz borrowed PHP 13,000. Said loan was paid in full and on time. Now, while on her 18th cycle, she is asking for a loan of PHP 15,000. She will use the money to buy additional ducks to raise and egg trays for the delivery of eggs. The resulting income will be used to improve her family's living conditions, pay for her children's education and renovate her house.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress out of earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":425943,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"purchasing additional ducks to raise","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Bago, Negros Occidental","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":145,"posted_date":"2009-11-21T16:50:14Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ma.

From his shop, he sells chicken meat to his customers and generates income for the family. Chicken consumption is different in every city, but people like to eat chicken over other meats. With the loan, he will buy chickens in larger quantities, which will help him fulfill the on time demands of his customers and earn more income. \r\n\r\nNasreen resides with her family in Riwind, which is a small city located in Punjab, Pakistan and known for its dairy industry. She moved here after her marriage many years ago. She herself is a seamstress, and sews clothes for neighborhood clients. She also does embroidery work that she learned from her mother prior to marriage. She believes that in today\u2019s world it is very difficult for one person to improve the financial condition of the family when the cost of living is getting higher every day. That\u2019s why she supports her husband financially with her sewing and embroidery work. \r\n\r\nShe has 3 sons. All of them have their own shops where they also sell chicken meat to their clients. They have a good reputation among their clients due to the quality of their fresh meat. \r\n\r\nNasreen is hopeful that an investment will take her husband\u2019s business to a more profitable position and bring more money to her home. She is a regular loan user of Asasah and this is her 4th loan application.

Raima is happy with how she managed the first year in this business. Her 16 year old daughter helps her out after school and Raima has good predictions for long-term business. With the returns from her business, she purchased a dairy cow for having fresh milk products for the entire family.

She is in a common-law relationship and lives with her partner Guillermo and her 14-year-old sister, who she is supporting by providing for her education.  Candy lives in her own home and she has no children.  She produces clothing for women, men, and children and then sells these items to relatives, friends, and acquaintances.  Her designs have received good reception because they have fine finishes.  Candy says that she learned this trade by studying at a vocational center and then became independent six years ago when she purchased a sewing machine with her own capital.  Her business has grown since that time.  Now she works with an assistant who she pays for each garment she produces.  Candy enjoys her business because she has the ability to produce new designs.  However, she occasionally suffers from physical exertion as a result of cutting and sewing for several hours in the same position.  Despite the pain, she has plans to expand and grow her business.  Candy wants to open a workshop in her house by purchasing more sewing machines.  \r\n<p>\r\nThis will be her sixth loan with the MFP organization.  She is grateful for the opportunity to have a line of credit to help advance her business.  For this reason, Candy promises to complete her payments just as she did with her previous loans.  In addition, she feels comfortable with her Communal Bank group because she considers the members to be good people.  The amount of 3000 PEN that she requested will be used to buy a new sewing machine valued at 600 PEN, as well as sewing materials for making clothes, such as fabrics and thread.     \r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1125,"image":{"id":930370,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to buy a sewing machine, fabrics, and thread.

Crecencia Oritiz, 46, is married with four children. The older two are now married and live with their spouses. The younger two are in school, one of them studies at the local high school and the other is in college. Juan Matto, Crecencia\u00b4s husband, has contributed to the household income through his job at a poultry farm. In 2003 they decided to begin raising chickens and have been doing well since that time. \r\nThe process of raising and feeding the chickens takes much work and patience.

All the preceding loans have been correctly repaid.  With this loan, they intend to buy 300 kg of rice, some tubers (100 kg of potatoes, 50 kg of yams, 50 kg of sweet potatoes), 100 kg of smoked or dried fish, 50 packets of Maggi cubes, and 50 kg of salt.  Supplies are procured at the Fakola marketplace from fair vendors.  Sales are made to fair vendors, travelers, housewives, and retailers of the surrounding villages. \r\n\r\nThe group members each hope to realize a profit of 35,000 francs CFA per month that will be used to repay the loan, and the rest will augment their working capital.  Their ambition is to diversify their commerce by embracing other income-generating work, such as selling cosmetics. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":875,"image":{"id":329328,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Restaurant","sector":"Food","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"To buy ingredients and condiments for the restaurant business ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Kolondi\u00e8ba","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:23Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":875,"lender_count":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Tenin","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Djenebou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bakoro ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fanta ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-05-06T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":400000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":875,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2009-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2009-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2009-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2009-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2009-11-02T08:00:00Z","amount":66666.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":145.83},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":145.83},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":145.83},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":145.83},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":145.83},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":145.85}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":291.67,"local_amount":133333.34,"processed_date":"2009-07-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T19:19:10Z","rounded_local_amount":135010.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63243067},{"amount":145.82,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2009-08-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T22:42:32Z","rounded_local_amount":67505.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73678922},{"amount":145.83,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2009-09-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T03:55:12Z","rounded_local_amount":67505.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87112677},{"amount":145.83,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2009-10-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T07:08:13Z","rounded_local_amount":67505.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97028243},{"amount":145.85,"local_amount":66666.65,"processed_date":"2009-11-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:56:12Z","rounded_local_amount":67505.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103873581}],"funded_date":"2009-07-09T16:17:32Z","paid_date":"2009-12-15T14:56:12Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Daniel Kuey","image":669418}},{"id":117114,"name":"Ligaya","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ligaya is 29 years old and married to Bonifacio.They are blessed with three children.

She is 46 years old and married. She has five children, two of whom have already graduated from college as nurses. She is working hard for the future of her three remaining children whom they continue to send to school.\r\n\r\nJasmin started her business by baking foods like pastries and cakes.  It is a trade she learned years ago and discovered that she has the knack for. She started selling these foods to her community and other neighboring villages. She also accepted orders for her baked goods. But in the year 2001, she needed additional capital to buy ingredients for her business so that she could accommodate all the orders. Luckily, she joined NWTF-Project Dungganon to address her need of additional capital. She was able to buy ingredients so she could meet all her deadlines for the orders. \r\n<p>\r\nAs her loan continued, she also started a cross-stitch business.  With the knowledge she acquired on how to do cross-stitch, she was able to make beautiful, neat and clean products. The new business has contributed to her income. For the two businesses, she is able to earn about $220 a month.  She saves most of her income to support the education of her children and the rest is used to support the needs of her family.\r\n\r\nA previous loan of 27,000 PHP was used as additional working capital for her baked products and cross-stitch businesses. Because of her success, she was able to maintain her good credit performance with NWTF-Project Dungganon. She was able to pay off the loan in full and on time. Now on her 16th cycle loan, with the same amount of 27,000 PHP, Jasmin will buy additional materials for her cross-stitch and baked goods businesses. Whatever income she gets will be used for the education of her children.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress out of earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":429231,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Embroidery","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"To

She is 36 years old. Jelyn is the group leader of a 3-member group loan offered by PMPC. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or default.\r\n\r\nJelyn is married and has 4 infant-aged children. To make a living, Jelyn owns and operates a business venture in the agriculture sector, particularly in hog raising. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling pigs. Jelyn has been engaged in her business for over 5 years and earns approximately 2,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Jelyn joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Jelyn has successfully repaid a previous loan of 9,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used as additional capital for the business. Jelyn is requesting a new loan of 16,500 PHP which will be used for house renovation. This loan will be the 4th loan taken out by Jelyn from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to financially support the immediate members of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

how the economy is developing and how the whole country is growing. Regarding the lives of individuals, however, there is little information available. So, the only way to learn is to consider our own lives and look at the lives of the people surrounding us. The general economic state of each country is estimated from all these lives. \r\n\r\nOur heroes (these group members) represent the multiplicity of any population. N. is fifty-five years old. She is a widow. She and her husband were happy enough, as they were endowed with six children. Most of these children are grownups, and not only make their own living, but also actively support N. in her old age. \r\n\r\nHer eldest daughter is married and works in Afghanistan, on American military bases. Her second daughter is married and works in Russia. The other two daughters are working in the capital city of Bishkek. Two of her sons are living with her. The elder one works for the local municipality. The younger son is fifteen and goes to school.\r\n\r\nN. keeps a cow, and does some household work. Her sons help her in their free time. N. decided to apply for this loan to buy a refrigerator. \r\n\r\nN.\u2019s partners: \r\n\r\nT. Esentaeva, 39, is married and has a twelve-year-old son. Her husband works in construction. T. is occupied with raising cattle, and intends to buy more calves to increase the total population. Therefore, this loan is very important to her. \r\n\r\nN. Imatova, 49, is a widow. She has a twenty-year-old son. He goes to college. N. is occupied with cattle breeding and this brings her a monthly income of about $110. N. needs this loan to purchase more cows or calves. She hopes that in the near future she will be able to buy her son a car. \r\n\r\nN. Otorov, 30, is the father of two little kids. His wife stays at home with the children. N. is the sole provider. He works as a taxi driver. N. hopes to obtain this loan because he is planning to purchase calves. \r\n\r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance, a young and ambitious socially-focused MFI in Kyrgyzstan.\r\n\r\nMol Bulak Finance is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development on the basis of 3-Ps concept - People (building human capital and taking care of its customers and the society as well), Profit (to be profitable to grow further) and the Planet (taking care of the environment).

Ready-To-Wear clothes. She lives in Paraiso Proper, Brgy. Taloc, Bago City, Negros Occidental. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2003 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and by her own efforts. By working hard in her businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of 4,000 Philippine pesos (PHP). Yolanda is now borrowing 22,000 PHP so that she can continue to fund her business operations. This will be her seventh loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of 19,500 PHP, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step on her journey towards economic freedom. Yolanda hopes to improve her family's living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the <i>Dungganon<\/i> way.\r\n\r\n<b>About NWTF:<\/b>\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means <u>honorable<\/u>).

She is from the village of Santa Rosa in the municipality of Gamu, Isabela province on the islands of Luzon. Marites raises pigs for fattening and sale. She has been in business for over three years and earns approximately 4000 PHP when she sells one of her pigs.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2008, Marites joined ASKI to gain access to its financial services. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10,000 PHP from ASKI that was used to purchase piglets to raise and sell in the future. Marites is requesting a new loan, her fifth from ASKI, of 12,000 PHP that will be used to purchase more piglets. She plans to use the additional revenue generated to expand her business. \r\n<p>\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n<p>\r\nAlalay sa Kaunlaran, Inc., or ASKI, is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 29 branches covering the central and northeastern areas.

He is married and has 2 children. He has over 20 years' experience in agriculture. He began helping his parents at the young age of 8 in his free time, normally when he would come home from school. He would help to plant beans and with the oxen. Unfortunately, he says, his parents never truly valued education, and he abandoned his studies at the age of 18 and got married. Since then, he has worked exclusively in agriculture, with a friend. They sow beans and vegetables such as onions, sweet peppers and some tomatoes. These harvests have allowed him to obtain his home and some agricultural tools.

fabricaci\u00f3n de productos alimenticios como deditos, empanaditas, arepas y pastelitos de queso, carne , o pollo, a los que imprime el sabor de la comida de su natal Cartagena,  ha logrado sostener   su hogar; Ana  lleg\u00f3 de su tierra desde sus 7 a\u00f1os a Barranquilla, ciudad capital,  donde hizo estudios primarios, contrajo matrimonio, tuvo 8 hijos y finalmente se separ\u00f3 de su esposo  e inici\u00f3 su propio negocio, que  al principio   fue la  preparaci\u00f3n de fritos en su propia casa, actividad que  cambi\u00f3 por la de panader\u00eda , con la que se posicion\u00f3 por muchos a\u00f1os en el mercado y construy\u00f3 su legado familiar en este oficio, pues  todos sus hijos en las edades de 25 a 38 a\u00f1os tienen su propia microempresa en panader\u00eda, o en preparaci\u00f3n de productos derivados de la harina de trigo. \nHoy  su principal actividad es la fabricaci\u00f3n de deditos, pastelitos, empanaditas de queso, pollo o carne, los cuales distribuye en los colegios de los barrios aleda\u00f1os a su vivienda y en tiendas donde es muy reconocida. Su meta principal es diversificar sus productos y la apertura de nuevos y permanentes mercados y este es justamente su gran desaf\u00edo.  En la actualidad est\u00e1 aplicando a su primer financiamiento con la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo,  mediante la l\u00ednea credikiva, ya que su capital de trabajo es muy peque\u00f1o y quiere fortalecerlo comprando, materias primas de contado para obtener descuentos por el volumen de compra, especialmente Harina de trigo, y az\u00facar, que aumentan sus precios permanentemente. El negocio de Ana en este momento presenta una Rotaci\u00f3n de cuentas por cobrar de 1,3 d\u00edas, una rotaci\u00f3n de inventarios de 5 d\u00edas, mientras su  rotaci\u00f3n de cuentas por pagar es de 2, 5 d\u00edas y su endeudamiento con el nuevo credikiva es de 11,20%. Ana Isabel es una gran madre que ha apoyado siempre a sus hijos y en la actualidad ellos la poyan tambi\u00e9n,  por eso su sue\u00f1o es verlos realizados y con vivienda propia.\n","en":"Ana R., age 62, is a very strong and enterprising woman.  She makes food products like deditos (a type of fried snack); empanaditas (little turnovers); corn cakes; and cheese, meat, or chicken pies.  She makes them with the flavor of food in her native Cartagena.  She has managed to support her household.\r\n\r\nAna left her land and arrived in Barranquilla, the capital city, seven years ago.  She attended elementary school, got married, and had eight children.  She eventually separated from her husband and started her own business.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning she made fried food in her own house.  She traded that activity for a bakery, which has been located in the market for many years.  She built her family legacy through this occupation.  All of her children, ages 25-38, have their own small bakery businesses or make products derived from wheat flour.\r\n\r\nNow she primarily makes deditos; corn cakes; cheese, meat, or chicken empanaditas; and cheese, meat, or chicken pies.  She distributes them to the schools in the neighborhoods surrounding her house.  She also delivers to stores where she is very well-known.\r\n\r\nHer main goal is to diversify her products and to open new and permanent markets.  This is precisely her great challenge.\r\n\r\nShe is currently applying for her first loan from the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo through Kiva.  She has very little work capital, and she wants to strengthen it by purchasing raw materials for cash.  She will do this to get volume discounts, especially for wheat flour and sugar.  These prices are constantly rising.\r\n\r\nAna\u2019s business now has a turnover on accounts receivable of 1.3 days, a 5 day turnover of inventory, and its turnover for accounts payable is 2.5 days.  Her debt with the new Kiva loan is 11.2%.\r\n\r\nAna is a great mother who has always supported her children.  Now, they support her as well.  Therefore, her dream is to see them become successful and have their own homes.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":712556,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bakery","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To buy a greater quantity of wheat flour and sugar","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2011-02-17T00:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ana Isabel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-02-16T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":800000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":73340},{"due_date":"2011-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":74745},{"due_date":"2011-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":76178},{"due_date":"2011-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":77638},{"due_date":"2011-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":79126},{"due_date":"2011-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":80643},{"due_date":"2011-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":82188},{"due_date":"2011-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":83764},{"due_date":"2011-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":85369},{"due_date":"2011-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":87009}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.96},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.71},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.47},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.24},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.04},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.84},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.66},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.5},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.36},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.22}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":38.96,"local_amount":73340,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:08:36Z","rounded_local_amount":73517.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201289276},{"amount":39.71,"local_amount":74745,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:04:20Z","rounded_local_amount":74925.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206157413},{"amount":40.47,"local_amount":76178,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:18:37Z","rounded_local_amount":76362.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211230424},{"amount":41.24,"local_amount":77638,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:09:26Z","rounded_local_amount":77825.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216509287},{"amount":42.04,"local_amount":79126,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:49:55Z","rounded_local_amount":79317.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221673505},{"amount":42.84,"local_amount":80643,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-17T08:02:25Z","rounded_local_amount":80837.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227320062},{"amount":179.74,"local_amount":338330,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:06:32Z","rounded_local_amount":339147.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232803203}],"funded_date":"2011-02-17T04:34:18Z","paid_date":"2011-10-15T09:06:32Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ginny Kalish"}},{"id":277763,"name":"Manuela De Jesus","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Do\u00f1a Manuela, tiene 57 a\u00f1os de edad, reside en El Transito departamento de San Miguel, vive con su madre y dos hermanas.

For over six years, she has been selling mazamorras -- a typical dessert in her area (a sweet corn-based pudding). She currently sells them from morning till night from a vending post that she has installed four years ago.

He owns a parcel of land on which he grows nopal.  Ismael is requesting a loan to buy compost for fertilizing his crop of nopal so that he can produce more to sell.  He also grows corn.  Ismael started his business three years ago.  His father taught him how to work in the fields and grow nopal and corn.  Ismael also raises sheep.  His business is important because it enables him to get ahead and feed his family.  The part he enjoys most is harvesting and selling the nopal.  This type of business is recognized internationally because the nopal is known for its flavor and medicinal properties.  His main challenge is dealing with the weather during the harvest season.  If there is hail, the impact from the hail will leave marks and cuts on the nopal leaves.  \r\n<p>\r\nHis hopes and dreams include increasing his nopal harvest, adding more rooms to his house, growing his sheep business, and seeing that his daughter grows up healthy and lacks nothing in her education.  San Andr\u00e9s Cuauhtempan is a beautiful town and Ismael was born there.  It receives all services and has a mild climate.  The crops that are grown there include corn, nopal, beans, and both red and green tomatoes.   \r\n<p>\r\nThe members of this group would like to say to Kiva and Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad, \u201cThank you for supporting and trusting us with this loan.  We appreciate the continued support each day and plan to succeed in submitting our payments.\u201d\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":784800,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase compost for fertilizing a crop of \"nopal\".

a la venta en volumen de hielo y boli; negocio que surgi\u00f3 justamente observ\u00f3 la gran demanda de los habitantes de este municipio, que posee  vocaci\u00f3n tur\u00edstica, por estar ubicado a la orilla del mar y provisto de playas, que albergan a su alrededor negocios como restaurantes y muchos vendedores ambulantes y que por su c\u00e1lido clima, sus habitantes y turistas buscan refrescarse continuamente para calmar su sed, especialmente en los meses de verano, \u00e9poca en la cual se impactan mayormente este tipo de ventas. Sus principales clientes son los vendedores al detalle que no tienen neveras y suelen enfriar sus refrescos con hielo y le siguen en su estructura de compradores los restaurantes. Como Yolima es una joven consciente de la oportunidad, tambi\u00e9n vende mercanc\u00edas variadas, como blusas, zapatos, pantalones y accesorios femeninos que compra en la ciudad de Barranquilla y los distribuye entre sus clientes en el municipio mediante plazos de pago adaptados a sus necesidades, facilitando que sus clientes puedan acceder a las mercanc\u00edas que necesitan, para pagar en varias partidas. Su capital de trabajo no es suficiente para hacer crecer ambos negocios, el primero ya requiere un congelador y el segundo exige responder a su creciente clientela que solicitan mercanc\u00edas variadas a Yolima y es muy dif\u00edcil ser oportuna. Esta es la raz\u00f3n de aplicar a su credikiva, primer financiamiento que hace a la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, con la cual comprar\u00e1 un congelador y ropa femenina y accesorios femeninos. Porque su sue\u00f1o y gran desaf\u00edo es crecer, hasta convertirse en la mayor distribuidora de su municipio. Mientras esto ocurre, Yolima trabaja persistentemente en su negocio con un margen de contribuci\u00f3n del 80% y con sus inventarios rotando cada 3 d\u00edas.\n\n","en":"Yolima is 29 years old and lives in the town of Puerto Colombia with her husband.  She sells ice in bulk and \"boli\" (flavored water in small plastic bags).  This business came about as she observed great demand by the inhabitants of this municipality.  The area has tourist potential, being located by the sea and beaches.  It is also home to businesses such as restaurants and many vendors.  The area is also known for its warm climate, so inhabitants and tourists alike continually seek to cool off and quench their thirst, especially in the summer months,which is a major impact on sales.  Yolima's main customers are vendors who do not have refrigerators and often cool their drinks with ice for restaurants to purchase.\r\n\r\nAs Yolima is a young woman who is aware of opportunity, she also sells general merchandise such as shirts, shoes, pants and accessories for women. She buys the items in the city of Barranquilla and distributes them to her customers in the municipality by payment terms tailored to their needs.  She enables her customers to access the goods they need by allowing them to pay in several payments.  Her working capital is not enough to grow both businesses; the first requires a freezer and the second requires responding to her growing clientele seeking a variety of goods, and it is very difficult for Yolima to be timely. \r\n\r\nThis is the reason why Yolima is applying for a loan with Kiva and this is her first financing with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  She plans to buy a freezer and women's clothing accessories.  Her dream and challenge is to grow and become the largest distributor in her municipality.  Until this happens, Yolima will work persistently in her business with a contribution margin of 80% and inventories rotating every 3 days.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":1081713,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy a freezer and women's clothing and accessories.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Puerto Colombia\/departamento del Atl\u00e0ntico","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2011-08-19T20:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Yolima","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-07-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":600000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":52705},{"due_date":"2011-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":56015},{"due_date":"2011-11-04T07:00:00Z","amount":57089},{"due_date":"2011-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":58183},{"due_date":"2012-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":59298},{"due_date":"2012-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":60435},{"due_date":"2012-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":61593},{"due_date":"2012-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":62774},{"due_date":"2012-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":63977},{"due_date":"2012-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":67931}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.74},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.68},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.3},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.94},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.59},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.26},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.93},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.61},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.32},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.63}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":63.42,"local_amount":108720,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:05:21Z","rounded_local_amount":113648.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232803737},{"amount":33.3,"local_amount":57089,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:58:50Z","rounded_local_amount":59677.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244568766},{"amount":33.94,"local_amount":58183,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:07:00Z","rounded_local_amount":60820.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250780091},{"amount":34.59,"local_amount":59298,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T10:20:59Z","rounded_local_amount":61986.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257188485},{"amount":35.26,"local_amount":60435,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:35:10Z","rounded_local_amount":63174.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263324703},{"amount":149.49,"local_amount":256275,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T09:31:33Z","rounded_local_amount":267892.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270038762}],"funded_date":"2011-08-25T00:49:05Z","paid_date":"2012-04-15T09:31:33Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Angela Yeh","image":827898}},{"id":331044,"name":"Samuel","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Samuel is a determined business man aged 37 years.

There is a good deal of competition for both things, but her clientele is so well established that she is at an advantage. Since she is so well known, she is recommended by her neighbors, who also are frequent clients themselves. She is always looking for new clients, too, for both of her businesses.

At 54, she's managed to get her own house but there are still a lot of things she wants.  For Ceferina, her son, Cristian, 11, has become the focus of all her efforts.  With her bag of cosmetics in hand, she goes out every day to convince her customers to buy a cream or some item of make-up from her.  Ceferina is very persuasive and it's not surprising that she's one of the top saleswomen.  She's operated the business for 3 years.  What she likes most is talking to customers and telling them about new products.  In the future, she would like to set up her own cosmetics shop becuase she's found it difficult to see all of her customers during every month.  Ceferina works tirelessly, month after month, with the single-minded goal of making a better life for her beloved son, Cristian.  This is Ceferina's first MFP loan and she's very happy to get it.  She's worked hard at her community bank to get this loan and doesn't want to miss a single installment.  She will use the loan to buy more cosmetics, investing the total amount in adding merchandise so that she has the stock she needs.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jere Wiseman, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":269960,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Add merchandise.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Puno","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15.833333 -70.033333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-02-13T21:10:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":225,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ceferina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-02-03T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":700,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":117},{"due_date":"2009-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":117},{"due_date":"2009-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":117},{"due_date":"2009-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":117},{"due_date":"2009-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":117},{"due_date":"2009-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":115}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":37.61},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.61},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.61},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.61},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.61},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.95}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":37.61,"local_amount":117,"processed_date":"2009-03-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:32:45Z","rounded_local_amount":121.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27117045},{"amount":37.6,"local_amount":117,"processed_date":"2009-04-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:42:32Z","rounded_local_amount":121.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36011958},{"amount":2.66,"local_amount":8.28,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T01:01:04Z","rounded_local_amount":8.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44595544},{"amount":72.55,"local_amount":225.72,"processed_date":"2009-06-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:37:21Z","rounded_local_amount":234.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52989805},{"amount":37.63,"local_amount":117,"processed_date":"2009-07-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:39:04Z","rounded_local_amount":121.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63210941},{"amount":36.95,"local_amount":115,"processed_date":"2009-08-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:17:51Z","rounded_local_amount":119.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73640446}],"funded_date":"2009-02-14T00:55:20Z","paid_date":"2009-09-15T19:17:51Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jere Wiseman","image":30736}},{"id":92554,"name":"Evelyn","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. B. was recognized as a Paglaum member on 29 May 2007 and is a resident of Barangay Guinabut.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, so they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro-leasing is that is allows clients to use their equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":320428,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Used Clothing","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"To purchase clothes in bulk for her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbeya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.9 33.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-05-16T20:50:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":300,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Tusajigwe ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":400000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","amount":400000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":300}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":300,"local_amount":400000,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-10T13:05:58Z","rounded_local_amount":402450,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144773310}],"funded_date":"2009-05-16T22:38:37Z","paid_date":"2010-12-10T13:05:58Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Diane Bird","image":220084}},{"id":113034,"name":"Audelys Isabel","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Audelys Isabel M.

Until recently she worked as a housekeeper in another remote town to support her family, causing her to neglect her two small children. Five months ago she decided to start her own business and begin selling typical local snacks and chicken. Unfortunately, the trip from home to Acatl\u00e0n de P\u00e9rez Figueroa to buy live chickens to bring back home to sell is very expensive.  Because of this, she is requesting a loan.  She wants to start a small farm to save on travel expenses, be more devoted to her children, ensure they get an education, and prepare them for a better future.  With the loan, Dolores will buy live chickens, water troughs, and feed.  For these same reasons, Dolores has joined La L. Group to apply for a loan from the Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad A.C.

She currently lives alone with them, since her husband Roberto is working in another city in the field of agriculture.\r\n\r\nTwo years ago, due to the circumstances of her life, Martha began selling charcoal in a market near her home. At first, the work was intermittent; she substituted for a woman who would leave the shop in her care. Over time, it became her permanent job, allowing her to help her husband with the household costs and other personal expenses. \r\n\r\nMartha enjoys running her shop, because she has no competition and it is profitable. In her own words, \"if she hadn't left it, I still would have continued, because it brought me plenty of income.\" \r\n\r\nMartha is able to run her business at the market and return home in the evening to see her daughters. She does not get tired, because she is an extremely hardworking woman with a strong desire to get ahead. She hopes someday to expand her business and sell charcoal wholesale in a large facility; thanks to her entrepreneurial spirit, she can already picture this in her mind. \r\n\r\nThis is Martha's fourth loan with MFP, and she is completely confident that she will repay it punctually, because she knows that she will have other loans in the future that will permit her to enhance her business. With the funds she is requesting, she will improve the infrastructure of the shop she currently operates, since it has deteriorated somewhat. She will begin by repairing the floor, so that her charcoal shop will project a better image to customers. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Patricia Linderman, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":420788,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Charcoal Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Renovating her charcoal shop","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-11-07T13:40:13Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":700,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Martha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-10-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":211.24},{"due_date":"2009-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":223.81},{"due_date":"2010-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":231.48},{"due_date":"2010-02-26T08:00:00Z","amount":242.25},{"due_date":"2010-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":258.52},{"due_date":"2010-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":265.55},{"due_date":"2010-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":278.77},{"due_date":"2010-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":288.38}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":73.93},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":78.34},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81.02},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.78},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.49},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92.94},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.57},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100.93}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":73.93,"local_amount":211.24,"processed_date":"2009-11-26T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:56:16Z","rounded_local_amount":214.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103843158},{"amount":152.27,"local_amount":435.05,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T21:05:52Z","rounded_local_amount":441.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734739},{"amount":7.09,"local_amount":20.24,"processed_date":"2010-01-26T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:10:40Z","rounded_local_amount":20.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118124098},{"amount":84.78,"local_amount":242.25,"processed_date":"2010-02-26T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:49:19Z","rounded_local_amount":245.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123959804},{"amount":90.49,"local_amount":258.52,"processed_date":"2010-03-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:33:14Z","rounded_local_amount":262.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128992649},{"amount":92.94,"local_amount":265.55,"processed_date":"2010-04-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:37:58Z","rounded_local_amount":269.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136717434},{"amount":97.57,"local_amount":278.77,"processed_date":"2010-05-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:39:42Z","rounded_local_amount":282.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144751186},{"amount":100.93,"local_amount":288.38,"processed_date":"2010-06-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:02:51Z","rounded_local_amount":292.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151933741}],"funded_date":"2009-11-07T19:48:43Z","paid_date":"2010-07-15T10:02:51Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Patricia Linderman","image":100107}},{"id":154172,"name":"Vicente","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Vicente G. is 50 years old and resides in Barangay Estefania Amulung, Cagayan.

She earns her living by operating three business ventures:  buying & selling dried fish, operating a sari-sari store and a farming business. Her husband Ernesto, who is 67 years old, works as a farmer to earn his living and helps in his wife's business activities. They have five children who are between 21 and 37 years old. Rosita joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2001 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 13 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Rosita has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 16,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 3,500, uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 14th loan, she is borrowing PHP 15,000 to use as additional capital for her business so that she can continue to save up for future family needs. Rosita is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams.

She has endeavored in many ways to provide for her family but found that she has a real gift for knitting so she has decided to dedicate more time to it and to perfect her craft.  For a long time she only made sweaters and caps for special order but she has now expanded her product line and offers a full range of woolen garments to the public.  Her products have been very well received and Clotilde has decided to open a small workshop where customers can come and see the work and place orders.  Her dream is to buy another knitting machine and expand her shop, growing it in a short time into a small factory.  She is asking for a loan of $350 and promises to repay the sum in 6 months.

Do\u00f1a Claudia desea poder darle a sus dos hijos una carrera y por eso se sacrifica horas de horas en su trabajo en sus tierras, produciendo frutas c\u00edtricas, pl\u00e1tanos y caf\u00e9. Esto le sirve para obtener ingresos e invertirlos en la educaci\u00f3n de sus hijos. Para ella este trabajo no es muy cansado, pero s\u00ed, muy costoso, por los abonos y  por el mantenimiento que tiene que dar a sus terrenos, sobre todo en la compra de plantas y semillas para aumentar su producci\u00f3n. Para esto que se solicita este pr\u00e9stamo, en espera que usted pueda ayudarla y as\u00ed conseguir que sus hijos sean profesionales."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":178976,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Purchase supplies and seeds for her crops, in order to earn enough to pay university tuition for her two youngest children.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2008-07-13T02:30:11Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":225,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Claudia Simona","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-07-27T06:37:45Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":600,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2008-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2008-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2008-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2008-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":100}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":38,"local_amount":101.33,"processed_date":"2008-08-27T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T01:59:10Z","rounded_local_amount":109.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308472},{"amount":38,"local_amount":101.33,"processed_date":"2008-09-27T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-09-28T07:54:28Z","rounded_local_amount":109.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339601},{"amount":74,"local_amount":197.34,"processed_date":"2008-11-26T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T00:17:47Z","rounded_local_amount":213.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5335296},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2008-12-26T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T01:29:05Z","rounded_local_amount":108.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9956474},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2009-01-26T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T14:11:50Z","rounded_local_amount":108.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":10226731}],"funded_date":"2008-07-13T06:37:45Z","paid_date":"2009-02-15T14:11:50Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":59783,"name":"Tatyana","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Tatyana is married with grown kids.

Due to her marital separation and in order to support the needs of her daughter, she launched a business selling food, and it has been going well so far.  One of the reasons for her success is that she does not need to rent a location because she has converted her house into a pension, where she offers a daily menu to a group of airline workers since her house is close to the airport.  To add to her income, she sells salchipollos (a dish with chicken and fries) at night.  She has had this business for 10 years and has enjoyed it a lot because she feels useful and above all, she constantly interacts with many people.  In the future, she hopes to have a very nice restaurant where she can welcome many dinner guests.  This is her fourth loan with Kiva partner MFP and it has been two years since she found out about the institution and of the communal bank methodology.

The profits will be used to make loan interest payments, to provide for family needs, and to invest the rest in business.  \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1025,"image":{"id":301172,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Restaurant","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To buy fish and to strengthen their catering business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SN","country":"Senegal","town":"THIES","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"14.783333 -16.966667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":108,"posted_date":"2009-04-09T22:50:12Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1025,"lender_count":32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Aly","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maymouna","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sokhna","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dior","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-04-03T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2009-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2009-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2009-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2009-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2009-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2009-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2009-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":62500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.12},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.12},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.12},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.12},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.12},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":128.12},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":128.12},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":128.16}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":128.13,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2009-05-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T19:43:36Z","rounded_local_amount":63458.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44636069},{"amount":128.13,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2009-06-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T04:26:04Z","rounded_local_amount":63458.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53037979},{"amount":128.13,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2009-07-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T20:49:18Z","rounded_local_amount":63458.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63262083},{"amount":128.09,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2009-08-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T23:37:33Z","rounded_local_amount":63458.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73703067},{"amount":128.12,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2009-09-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T05:01:36Z","rounded_local_amount":63458.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87132653},{"amount":128.12,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2009-10-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T08:27:43Z","rounded_local_amount":63458.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97046922},{"amount":128.12,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2009-11-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T15:18:00Z","rounded_local_amount":63458.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103892471},{"amount":128.16,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2009-12-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T17:57:29Z","rounded_local_amount":63458.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110780979}],"funded_date":"2009-04-14T03:11:57Z","paid_date":"2010-01-15T17:57:29Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Daniel Kuey","image":669418}},{"id":104858,"name":"Flor De Maria","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Flor es socia del Banco Comunal Renacer.\nFlor es casada, tiene 42 a\u00f1os y 4 hijos, Flor junto a su esposo viajan a las ferias D. la regi\u00f3n en donD. compra ganado y luego los comercializa en la feria D.

S. is married and has six children. Her hometown is Belo, Cameroon where she sells koki beans and palm oil in the Mejang Market. Prodensia purchases these items in bulk and sells them at retail prices. With this loan she plans to purchase koki beans, three tins of palm oil, a bag of groundnuts (peanuts) along with her transport costs.\r\n<p>\r\nProdensia knows her resale business will do well. She knows that \"people need koki bean to prepare they things with.\" Koki beans are commonly used to prepare local dishes in Cameroon. A particular favorite, which is often sold on the street, is a deep-fried, Madeline-shaped finger food. It can be served with Pepe (hot pepper) sauce. The tins of palm oil she plans to purchase are more like large barrels and the palm oil is a deep red-orange color.\r\n<p>\r\nProdencia has faced sickness and death in her family and notes that she \"hates stealing.\" With the profits from this loan Prodensia plans to buy seeds, yams and koki beans for her farm. Most families have a farm in Cameroon. A lot of times, too, the farm is a small or long walk from your compound.\r\n<p>\r\nThis is Prodensia's second loan from GHAPE since she became a member in early 2008. She takes out GHAPE loans because the loan conditions are preferable.\r\n<p>\r\nAbout GHAPE\r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon. GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach. Every client is trained in business management, basic health, life skills, financial management, profits and losses, and family values. Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement.

In the beginning, he was working very long hours, and the pay wasn't enough to justify keeping him away from his family for so long - in fact, he says, it wasn't even enough to support his family. That's when he had the idea to import handmade crafts from his home country and sell them in Miami. Pedro says that the accessories he imports were not well-known in Miami before he started importing them, but he has been successful in selling them. His wife chooses the inventory and gets the best deal possible, and he sells it to responsible distributors in Miami and other metro areas such as NY, LA, Houston, and Atlanta.<P>\r\n\r\nPedro will use this loan to increase his inventory, and he says that clients have requested more products that he does not have at the moment. He says the loan will also help him increase his inventory in preparation for increased demand during the holiday season. In the future, he hopes to start importing items from other countries, such as Peru and Mexico, directly from the local craftsmen and women who make them.<P>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\nAbout U.S. Microfinance and ACCION USA<P>\r\n\r\nHave you ever thought about how the cute new caf\u00e9 on your corner or the salon you frequent every month got the financial resources to start their business? Chances are, they drummed up support from their friends and family, dipped into their personal savings, used a high-interest credit card, or all of the above. An estimated 10 million small businesses in the U.S. face difficulty obtaining loans from traditional banks, even prior to the current \u201ccredit crisis.\u201d Microfinance institutions like ACCION USA support these \u201cunbanked\u201d small businesses by giving them access to fairly-priced capital and business education. <P>\r\n\r\nSmall businesses also help stabilize low- to moderate-income neighborhoods and rebuild our economy through income growth and job creation. Self-employment provides workers with a way to increase their incomes, support their families, and strengthen their communities. As unemployment rises in the U.S., more and more people are turning to self-employment and start-up enterprises as a way to take control of their economic futures and provide employment opportunities in their communities. The need for support of small businesses in the U.S. is great, and it is one that ACCION USA has been striving to meet since

Ana is requesting a new loan of 9,500 PHP which will be used to purchase livestock feed & other supplies. This will be the 2nd loan taken out by Ana from PMPC.

Many people these days are refrained by daily routine and daily needs and do not have high objectives toward which they would aspire. This is not the case with the heroes of our story. They represent the middle\u2013income or even lower middle\u2013income class and do not seem to be distinguished from other people except that they all have high objectives and the determination to achieve them.\r\n<p>\r\nAsylkan Y. is the group leader. She is a widow and lives with her son (16 years), grandson and daughter-in-law. Asylkan works as an accountant and also raises cattle. Two and half years ago, she bought a cow and since then she has been trying to increase the population of her livestock. \r\n<p>\r\nNow her accountant's salary is a little over 80 USD a month. She would like to have income from selling milk and trading in cattle during weekends at a cattle market. She has decided to apply for a loan to buy two lambs, pay a shepherd for grazing, and buy forage for them. In the future she hopes to buy a car for her son and furniture for her home.\r\n<p>\r\nGulzaira T., 49, is a widow. Her son works in a resort and earns a salary of 185 USD. Gulzaira does odd jobs in some factory. She hopes to obtain this loan to buy a big carpet and some clothes.\r\n<p>\r\nAnarkul A., 41, is single. She keeps some cattle at her parent\u2019s and works as a laborer in \u201cPAT\u201d factory. With her loan she hopes to help her sister prepare the dowry of her daughter.\r\n<p>\r\nApal C., 48, is a widow. Her son works as a baker and has a salary of 95 USD.

Her greatest wish is to buy another vehicle, and she is saving up for it. This is her fourth loan with MFP, and she will be punctual with repayments. She is grateful to those who support her loan, and knows it will be very useful in the growth of her business. With the requested loan, she will invest in the purchase of replacement parts for the maintenance of her vehicle.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Christine Cooper, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":546455,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Transportation","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"Replacement parts for vehicle maintenance","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"HUANCAYO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.066667 -75.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-06-01T19:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":700,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Zenaida ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-05-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":700}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":700,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T04:41:02Z","rounded_local_amount":2011.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191462938}],"funded_date":"2010-06-07T03:38:19Z","paid_date":"2011-02-16T04:41:02Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Christine Cooper","image":1766620}},{"id":208136,"name":"Sarah","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sarah is married with seven children, all of them in school, and also looks after her granddaughter.

She also lives with their two children, ages 11 and 8.\r\n\r\nSince her husband's salary is very low, Dinora decided eight years ago to open her own business, which allows her to contribute to all the household expenses along with her husband.  This is why she invested her savings in a perishable goods store, which was born from her initiative to have more economic stability.  Dinora is asking for a loan so she can invest more in her store, buying products like sausages, detergents, bread and other products.  She hopes to do this with the loan, since although she has had the shop for several years she has not had the money to invest in it because most of her earnings go toward household expenses.<br

Such is the case of Richard who, at the age of 35, has gone through many adversities but has always put on a brave face. \nFor the past ten years, he has been practicing mixed farming and his primary source of income has been milk, eggs and crop selling. He also engages in a small business to supplement the meager income he earns through farming. \n\nRichard passionately loves dairy farming but the biggest challenge he faces is feeding his cows and satisfying the largely unsatisfied milk market. He is seeking a loan to build a modern dairy unit and buy another quality breed of dairy cow. The dairy unit will assist Richard in managing his cows well and also protecting them from the harsh weather conditions.

Yalcou\u00e9, age 40, lives in a polygamous family with her husband, co-wives, and seven children (four boys and three girls) in Banconi, one of the outlying districts of the city of Sikasso (third administrative region of the Republic of Mali).  After having tried several kinds of work without success, she opted to become initiated eight years ago in the commerce of 'Wax' pagnes (highly prized cloth in West Africa), embroidered fabrics, bedsheets, and 'Super'  basins.  She works at the marketplace of her district in Sikasso where she is in high demand by her customers, thanks to the quality of her goods. \r\n\r\nTo satisfy her burgeoning customer base, she decided to join the micro-finance institution Soro Yiriwaso five years ago.  After five solidarity loans (group loans) with a women's association of her district (Association Benkadi de Banconi), she is now on her fourth individual loan.  All of the preceding loans have been correctly repaid. \r\n\r\nShe intends to use this loan to buy:  10 lengths of 'Wax' pagnes, 10 sets of embroidered fabrics, 10 sets of sheets, and 10 sets of 'Super' basins.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.
