Alongside her siblings and parents, she would spend 12 hours a day creating beautiful handmade clothing and jewelry and selling it at markets.  When she moved to San Francisco in 1985, she had to put her artisanal talents temporarily on hold as she cleaned homes to make a living. However, after she gave birth to her daughter in 1993, her commitment to family and her love for handicrafts led her to resume selling artisanal crafts.   \r\n\r\n\u201cWhen I gave birth to my daughter, I realized how important it was to be able to spend more time with her. I needed a job that would allow me to take care of my child.\u201d \r\n\r\nAs she had once done in Ecuador, Rosa began selling her clothing and jewelry in the streets of the Mission, a San Francisco neighborhood\u2014but this time she is able to earn a living through the arts while working significantly fewer hours than she did as a child or in her career cleaning houses. \r\n\r\n\u201cI work extremely hard. Owning my own shop gives me the freedom to create my own schedule and spend time with family, as well\u201d, Rosa noted. \r\n\r\nWord of Rosa\u2019s beautiful jewelry has spread over the years and her business has grown so much that she was able to open up a storefront right in the Mission, named Native Hand by Hand and Silver Fashions. But in 2009, when she wanted a loan in order to expand her business, she was considered \u201cunbankable\u201d by major banks because she did not have any credit history. After a friend referred her to Opportunity Fund, she used a microloan to buy more inventory. She was able to pay back her loan and increase her credit score to 727. Now she has established her credit history and become more integrated into the U.S. financial system.\r\n\r\nRosa wants to expand her business even more in order to pay for her daughter\u2019s college and she needs a loan for $1,500 to purchase additional inventory for her store.  \u201cI am so proud of my daughter for having graduated from high school this spring,\u201d she said. But along with this joy comes the necessity of providing for further education.

This leads to poor financial support hence poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.\r\n\r\nSELFINA buys and leases equipment to women.

With his dedication, Felipe's business has become profitable and because it is one of the few stores in the community, it has been relatively easy to build up a faithful client base.

She lives with her grandchildren and her youngest child in a rented apartment in a town called Wasa Simpa in the western region of Ghana.\r\n\r\nAfua has traded in coconut oil for 25 years. Coconut oil is produced from coconut fruits. She produces the oil and supplies it to food vendors to prepare their meals. She even treks to the villages to purchase the finished goods elsewhere when demand is very high.\r\n\r\nAfua belongs to a village bank called \"Joy.\" She hopes to receive GH\u00a2400 to make business progress by restocking her inventory. She wants to use the loan to buy more bags of coconut and an electric milling machine to increase her efficiency and produce larger quantities. She believes the loan will help expand her business to raise more income to support and to provide food for her family and finance an education for her youngest child and her grandchildren.

She requests a loan that will be used to buy supplies in bulk, such as ripe plantains, flour, and vegetable oil. She will thus be able to prepare apoti in bulk. With the loan she will increase her earnings to save more for the educational needs of her children.  \r\n\r\nShe is the leader of a trust bank group called \u2018Nyame ye odo\u2019 which literally means God is love. She is the one sitting in front in the group photograph. Most of the members of this group are petty traders, food vendors, and\/or farmers. In this group, members commit to each other as social collateral to access the loan and apply peer pressure to repay the loan. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2675,"image":{"id":360670,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To buy ripe plantains, flour, maize etc.\tin bulk","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GH","country":"Ghana","town":"Sefwi Wiawso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"8 -2","type":"point"}},"partner_id":88,"posted_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:25Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2675,"lender_count":73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Beatrice","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Esther ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Theresa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rose","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Felicia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Veronica","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Margaret","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sarah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-07-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GHS","disbursal_amount":4000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":2675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":444.44},{"due_date":"2009-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":444.44},{"due_date":"2009-10-27T07:00:00Z","amount":444.44},{"due_date":"2009-11-27T08:00:00Z","amount":444.44},{"due_date":"2009-12-27T08:00:00Z","amount":444.44},{"due_date":"2010-01-27T08:00:00Z","amount":444.44},{"due_date":"2010-02-27T08:00:00Z","amount":444.44},{"due_date":"2010-03-27T07:00:00Z","amount":444.44},{"due_date":"2010-04-27T07:00:00Z","amount":444.48}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":297.22},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":297.22},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":297.22},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":297.22},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":297.22},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":297.22},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":297.21},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":297.22},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":297.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":297.22,"local_amount":444.44,"processed_date":"2009-08-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T22:29:54Z","rounded_local_amount":445.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73670887},{"amount":297.22,"local_amount":444.44,"processed_date":"2009-09-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T03:40:20Z","rounded_local_amount":445.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87109418},{"amount":297.22,"local_amount":444.44,"processed_date":"2009-10-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T06:58:38Z","rounded_local_amount":445.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97025572},{"amount":297.22,"local_amount":444.44,"processed_date":"2009-11-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:52:20Z","rounded_local_amount":445.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103870116},{"amount":297.22,"local_amount":444.44,"processed_date":"2009-12-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T16:57:31Z","rounded_local_amount":445.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110759433},{"amount":297.22,"local_amount":444.44,"processed_date":"2010-01-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-04T09:23:20Z","rounded_local_amount":445.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118148138},{"amount":297.21,"local_amount":444.44,"processed_date":"2010-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-26T07:59:40Z","rounded_local_amount":445.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123986276},{"amount":297.22,"local_amount":444.44,"processed_date":"2010-03-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-18T08:27:18Z","rounded_local_amount":445.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":129017101},{"amount":297.25,"local_amount":444.48,"processed_date":"2010-04-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-25T08:14:05Z","rounded_local_amount":445.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136742168}],"funded_date":"2009-08-22T19:04:15Z","paid_date":"2010-05-25T08:14:05Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"John Lynch","image":null}},{"id":129867,"name":"Merlyn","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Merlyn G. is from the village of Landing, Camella Talakag, Bukidnon.

Her business is very profitable as she can count on a robust portfolio of customers. The most difficult is to charge for her products as her clients don't always have the funds to pay her. But in her 3 years' experience, she has arranged to be paid in full for all of her sales. She would like to locate her cosmetics sales business where she can sell them more comfortably, without needing to go door-to-door.\r\n\r\n<p>With her first loan, Maritza wants to grow her business, and wants to repay all of her installments on time, so that she can receive an additional loan. She knows she can also count on the support of her communal bank. With this loan, she will buy more cosmetics and hopes to increase her sales.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michelle Harrison, Kiva

She is 40 years old, is married, and has three school-aged children.\n\nCecilia owns and operates a business running a stall, primarily selling dried fish products in the local community. She has been engaged in her business for over eight years and earns approximately 3,000 PHP a month.\n\nIn 2008, Cecilia joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. Cecilia has successfully repaid a previous loan of 6,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell.\n\nCecilia is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional inventory and used as working capital. This loan will be her 3rd from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \n\n\nAbout PMPC:\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\n\n\n *Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

(0) is a 33-year-old woman living in the town of Vaitoloa.  She is married and has 2 infant-aged children.  To make a living, Malia owns & operates a business venture in the food sector making & selling food.  While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling a variety of food products in the local community.  Malia has been engaged in this business for over 1 years and earns approximately 400 WST a month from these activities.\n\nMalia joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve  her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Malia has successfully repaid a previous loan from SPBD.  This previous loan was used to purchase raw ingredients needed to make products for sale.  Malia is now requesting a new loan of 1750 WST which will be used to purchase raw ingredients needed to make products for sale.  The loan will be the 3rd loan taken out by the borrower from SPBD.  Malia plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business  to improve\/expand the borrower's business.\n\nAbout SPBD:\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.\n\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\"\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":381611,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

Rosalina, together with her husband and children, manage their household while operating the business. She is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nRosalina operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a Php5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. Rosalina earns her income by purchasing supplies at wholesale prices and selling the items separately. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of Php 400 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue the operations of her business, she is requesting a Php 10,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nRosalina hopes to be able to expand soon. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners.

Jackline is 22-years-old and lives in the town of Kasese in the Fort Portal region of Uganda. For the past three years, Jackline has been working hard to manage her clothes store which sells various kinds of clothing. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Jackline has requested a loan of 400,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more bundles of clothes and will help Jackline to generate greater profits and pay her children's school fees. Jackline hopes that in the future she will be able to buy a plot of land and build a home. \r\n\r\nJackline is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills training. The ELA program has increased Jackline's future prospects by helping her to learn how to save money.

She has since increased her daily income by 90% and managed to save a bit of her profits. She plans to move her business into a larger space and a more lucrative location with the US$500 loan she has applied for. She will use this money to pay rent for a larger shop, to increase her stock, and to obtain supplies that are in high demand within her community.<p>\r\n<i>\r\nDisclaimer: Due to recent events in Kenya, the security situation in many communities remains unsettled, affecting many local businesses. Lenders to this entrepreneur should be aware that this loan may represent a higher default risk, and should be willing to accept this additional risk in making their loan.<\/i>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":190325,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.<P>\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.<P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is 36 years old. Lucita is married and has two school-aged children. To make a living, Lucita owns and operates a sari-sari (variety) retail shop. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling a variety of different products in the local community. Lucita has been engaged in her business for over three years and earns approximately 4,500 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Lucita joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. Lucita is requesting a loan of 5,000 PHP, which she will use to invest in expanding her business. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Lucita from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement the income of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Her husband is a dump truck driver.\r\n\r\nShe has a pig breeding corral near her house and is raising around 20 pigs of diverse sizes.  After breeding and raising them, Janeth sells the pigs live to buyers who come to her house.  On other occasions, she butchers them and sells the meat to her neighbors or to stores in the region.\r\n\r\nJaneth works for a time every day.  The pigs don't need much care.

At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nMinerva operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, 5 PHP-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. Minerva earns income by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling each item. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 300 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 8,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nMinerva hopes to be able to expand her business soon, just as she fervently hopes that her children will be able to graduate one day, and finish their studies. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and to also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God which she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay micro-finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":809121,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

raises cattle in order to share her husband\u2019s hard labor. Fourteen years ago, Jyldyz and her husband obtained a piece of land upon which they began growing wheat. Since then, they have bought a car and raised four children, providing all of them with college educations. Three of her three children, two sons and a daughter, have already married and live separately with their own families, so only their youngest son, 23, who is a student, still lives with them. With only the three of them, it is easier to make ends meet, but as harvesting time is approaching, Jyldyz needs a loan to cover expenses on hired labor and fuel. With part of this loan she would also like to purchase wheat seeds in advance for lower prices. Among Jyldyz\u2019s dreams that she is determined to fulfill are purchasing a house and car for her son and increasing the total population of their livestock.  <p>\r\n\r\nJyldyz has three partners: Elmira, Suyumkan and Ainagul. Elmira is 44, a widow and mother of three daughters. Having received a piece of land from the village council to farm on, Elmira needs a loan to purchase 1650 pounds of wheat seeds, pay for labor and buy fuel. <p>\r\n\r\nSuyumkan, 51, and her husband are farmers who grow wheat and sunflowers. Farming allows them to live independently, and Suyumkan needs a loan to purchase seeds and fuel.  <p>\r\n\r\nAinagul, 51, has raised five children. Having obtained land from the village council and investing in it, she has been farming for the last 18 years.

the rural areas surrounding San Pedro, a town once famous for sugarcane production but which is now largely in decay, where running water (none of which is potable) and electricity are unreliable. She makes her home here in a simple, wooden structure with her longterm partner and their two children.\r\n\r\nJuliana is excited to be taking her second loan with Esperanza after having successfully repaid her previous loan and grown her business.

She is 56 years old, married and has 7 children. One of them is of school age and the others are grown up. After graduating from Trade College in the capital city, Shabirkul worked in the trade sector for many years. Her colleagues characterized her as a very diligent and responsible person.   \r\n\r\nAfter the breakdown of the Soviet Union, Shabirkul and her family started their own business of cultivating kidney beans, wheat and potatoes. Using the small amount of 3,000 Kyrgyz soms to purchase and plant seeds, Shabirkul and her family worked hard to get a good harvest. \r\n\r\nBeing a persistent person, Shabirkul organized a farmers\u2019 group named \u201cFruitful Land\u201d and applied for a group loan of 20,000 Kyrgyz soms. She bought a milk cow and fodder for her cattle. After that, Shabirkul applied for an individual loan of another 20,000 Kyrgyz Soms, which she used to cultivate beans and potatoes. Shabirkul used her loans as intended and repaid them without any delays. \r\n\r\nAll these activities allowed Shabirkul to give a good dowry to her daughter, hold her son\u2019s wedding and renovate her house. In 2009, life put Shabirkul through a severe test: her husband had a stroke and died. However, Shabirkul braced herself to make her children\u2019s life stable.  \r\n\r\nShabirkul is applying for a loan of 25,000 Kyrgyz soms to purchase fertilizer to cultivate her plot of land with wheat, kidney beans and potatoes. With the revenues from the loan, she plans to broaden her business by purchasing cattle and building a barn.\r\n\r\nBai-Tushum and Partners uses Kiva funding to target the especially vulnerable population. Kiva borrowers benefit from a 5% discount on the interest rate if they pay back without delay.\r\n\r\nBai-Tushum and Partners is one of the leading Microfinance Institutions in Kyrgyzstan. As a reliable financial partner, Bai-Tushum contributes to the economic development of the Kyrgyz Republic through the delivery of microfinance services in rural and urban areas that lead to increased employment and meet the interests of its clients and investors.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":572307,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase fertilizer","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Chymgent village, Talas region","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2010-07-22T21:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Shabirkul","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-07-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":25000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2011-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":15000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":220},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":330}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":220,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T01:43:33Z","rounded_local_amount":10354.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191378702},{"amount":330,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:22:34Z","rounded_local_amount":15531.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221622638}],"funded_date":"2010-07-23T02:12:15Z","paid_date":"2011-08-15T08:22:34Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"David Walker","image":null}},{"id":220894,"name":"Agnetta Achieng","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Agnetta has been selling fish in Naivasha town for the last twenty-one years.

Martaba is 34 years old. She is married and has two children. Martaba has been running a grocery store for the past 2 years. She sells sweets, preserved food, juices, soft drinks, perfumes and many others items in her grocery. The inventory she has for sale is of very good quality and selection. Martaba is respectful and patient with all of her customers, which attracts people and brings them back to her vending facility to buy groceries again. Martaba is seeking to keep her business sustainable and has requested a loan of $3000 USD to increase the inventory she has for sale. We believe this current loan will enhance the potential of her business and help Martaba reach all of her aspirations.       \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

They live together in their own home in the Nueva Fortaleza community in Pichari.  Mary comes from a family whose members have traditionally made their livings in agriculture.  From them she learned to plow the land and to plant cocoa.  She has continued in this line of work and, with the help of her father and her siblings, introduced new farming techniques.  But sometimes she needs to contract day laborers to take care of the harvest, since that's a job that requires a lot of physical strength.  Mary feels confident in her work.

In their house, they have a grocery store that is well-stocked and well-located since it lies on a corner and visible to the neighborhood. Juvenal is a veterinarian by profession and has his small office in his house. In addition to these activities, they are also making clothing for women in collaboration with one of their daughters, who carries the products to the border. In their neighborhood they have competition for their grocery store, but there is no other vet nearby. The loan's goal is to increase working capital for their clothing shop and for their grocery store, which will generate the most income. Juvenal has had a good record of making payments in all his loans demonstrating responsibility and organization.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jay Osborne, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":321841,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Working Capital","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-17 -65","type":"point"}},"partner_id":73,"posted_date":"2009-05-22T05:50:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1100,"lender_count":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juvenal","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-04-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1100,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":52.72},{"due_date":"2009-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":54.04},{"due_date":"2009-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":55.39},{"due_date":"2009-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":56.77},{"due_date":"2009-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":58.19},{"due_date":"2009-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":59.65},{"due_date":"2009-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":61.14},{"due_date":"2010-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":62.67},{"due_date":"2010-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":64.23},{"due_date":"2010-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":65.84},{"due_date":"2010-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":67.49},{"due_date":"2010-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":69.17},{"due_date":"2010-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":70.9},{"due_date":"2010-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":72.67},{"due_date":"2010-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":74.49},{"due_date":"2010-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":76.35},{"due_date":"2010-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":78.29}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.72},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.04},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.39},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.77},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.19},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.65},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":61.14},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.67},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.23},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.84},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.49},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.17},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.9},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.67},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.49},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.35},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":78.29}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":52.72,"local_amount":52.72,"processed_date":"2009-06-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T20:32:10Z","rounded_local_amount":52.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52955795},{"amount":54.04,"local_amount":54.04,"processed_date":"2009-07-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T13:45:46Z","rounded_local_amount":54.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63173090},{"amount":55.39,"local_amount":55.39,"processed_date":"2009-08-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T15:09:20Z","rounded_local_amount":55.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73598579},{"amount":56.77,"local_amount":56.77,"processed_date":"2009-09-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T17:20:14Z","rounded_local_amount":56.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87034156},{"amount":58.19,"local_amount":58.19,"processed_date":"2009-10-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T20:59:25Z","rounded_local_amount":58.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96946377},{"amount":59.65,"local_amount":59.65,"processed_date":"2009-11-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T12:27:14Z","rounded_local_amount":59.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103788161},{"amount":61.14,"local_amount":61.14,"processed_date":"2009-12-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T13:09:00Z","rounded_local_amount":61.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110678344},{"amount":702.1,"local_amount":702.1,"processed_date":"2010-01-26T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:27:59Z","rounded_local_amount":702.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118072901}],"funded_date":"2009-05-24T11:52:53Z","paid_date":"2010-02-15T11:27:59Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jay Osborne","image":883556}},{"id":113534,"name":"Emma","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Emma G. is 37 years old and blessed with two school-age children, ages 17 and 13.

She has two independent children who help her economically.  As a single mother, Maria works as a maid and would like to remodel her house little by little.  Her 15-year work history gives her stability in the labor market which is to her benefit.  The loan she is requesting will be used to purchase building materials like:  cement, a toilet, concrete blocks, zinc plates, iron.  She will build a wall and give maintenance to her toilet providing comfort and security for her family.  Thanks to these loans she will be able to make these improvements because, without financing, this would be impossible due to the high costs of building materials.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":390878,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":null,"use":"To purchase construction materials to build a wall.

She is 52 years old. Niza is married and has 4 adult aged children. To make a living, Niza owns & operates a business venture in the food sector operating a fishing business. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from buying & selling fish in the local community. Niza has been engaged in her business for over 10 years and earns approximately 6,000.00 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2006, Niza joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Niza has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000.00 PHP from GDMPC. This previous loan was used to purchase additional fish to sell. Niza is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This loan will be the third loan taken out by Niza from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three units offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":125,"image":{"id":411411,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish

Carmen raises her animals until they have developed enough to sell to traders who visit the area.  She usually raises cows, sheep, and poultry.\r\n<p> \r\nCarmen has been saving money over the past few months so that she could lease some land for growing corn.  She wants to apply fertilizers and irrigate the land to ensure a good harvest.  For this reason, she is requesting her first loan from Edpyme Alternativa in the amount of 2000 PEN to help accomplish this goal.\r\n<p>\r\nCarmen is a determined mother who is devoted to her family.  Her greatest dream is to continue growing as a businesswoman to secure a better quality of life for her children.

The parts of the business that Alidia likes best is drying the maize after a harvest and selling gladiolus in the city's flower market.  Her husband wants to raise cattle so she wants to buy bulls.  She also wants to continue with the farming business.  Recently, she and her husband have talked about pulling together enough working capital to set up a restaurant at a mining settlement called Cerro de Pasco where they could make the most of the demand among the miners there.  This is Alidia's third MFP loan.  She says that she likes working with her community bank because the members of the group support one another.  With this loan, Alidia will buy seeds and bags of manure for sowing a new crop.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jere Wiseman, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":580445,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Seeds and manure for farming business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-08-08T21:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alida ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-07-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-11T08:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":375}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":375,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:37:45Z","rounded_local_amount":1050.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201326875}],"funded_date":"2010-08-09T00:44:35Z","paid_date":"2011-04-15T11:37:45Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jere Wiseman","image":30736}},{"id":225006,"name":"Fikret","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Fikret  S. is 52 years old and lives with his wife and three children.

She resides in the small town of Karabalta, is married, and has a twelve-year-old son. Her husband is a construction worker in another town and her son goes to middle school. \r\n\r\nFor almost fifteen years Gulnara has been selling milk at home. The fact that she operates a dairy business is known to the whole neighborhood, so there is usually a constant flow of customers. An initial capital of 20,000 KGS was loaned by a local bank, and the family repaid it successfully. Now it generates $83 monthly, but it\u2019s not enough to purchase calves for fattening. \r\n\r\nTherefore, Gulnara applied for a loan from Kiva. She is confident in every member of her group and believes in a high commitment in repaying the loan successfully. \r\n\r\n         --- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance (MBF), a young, ambitious and socially-focused Micro-finance Institution in Kyrgyzstan. MBF is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development and upholds the triple bottom line \u2013 People (building human capital and taking care of its customers as well as society), Planet (keeping environmentally friendly) and Profit (earning revenue to expand autonomously).
