Faisalabad. Faisalabad is Pakistan\u2019s third largest city and is well known for its textile industry. Her home is a small one containing two rooms. She shifted here 17 years ago with her family. Robina is a housewife and the mother of three sons and two daughters. Her eldest son wasn't interested in education and started work as a painter a few years ago. Her other children are enrolled in school and are getting their education. \r\n\r\nRobina's husband has a business which sells construction supplies. He offers construction supplies to customers and earns money for his family. He has been doing this work for the past 15 years.

She operates 2 businesses: hog raising and buying & selling dried fish. Her husband, Raul, who is 62 years old, works as a laborer. They have 10 children aged between 15 and 37 years old. \r\n\r\nMarina joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2000 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 17 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Marina has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 29,500 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 20,000, lifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her 18th loan, she is borrowing PHP 29,500. She intends to use this to buy medicines and vaccines for pigs so that she can continue to save up for future house repairs and the expansion of her business. Marina is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \t\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She lives in her own home together with her partner, 28 year-old Heber, and their two children: 7 year-old Magaly and 2 year-old Natalie.  She would like to provide a good education for her children so that they can enjoy a better future.\r\n\r\nMagaly and her partner both have plans to carry out many projects.  Three years ago they invested their savings in buying all kinds of spare parts and lubricants for all types of vehicles.  Magaly works in her business selling these products.  She says that it is doing very well and is very profitable.  Sometimes she has a lot of customers to serve and so her partner supports her.  He also teaches her how she should serve and please their customers.  He has experience repairing vehicles.\r\n\r\nMagaly enjoys her business.  In spite of making good profits, she doesn't neglect her friendships.  For this reason, she is very well liked by her neighbors.

It is difficult for them to earn a living because they have no stable job. \r\n\t\r\nHer husband cultivates their parcel of land by planting rice and some vegetables while Febelyn uses their tricycle to earn income. Through her patience and sacrifices, she earns a minimum income of PHP 200 per day. She utilizes this to acquire their daily basic needs and to save for the future of their child. Due to the high cost of commodities, she needs to earn more income to meet their daily needs. Consequently, she wants to borrow additional capital from ASKI, amounting to PHP 7,000. It will be used for the maintenance of their tricycle. She is very grateful for this financial assistance because it will allow her to use her tricycle continuously and thus improve their living conditions.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":406611,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Motorcycle

lives in the outskirts of Guayaquil.  Her house is concrete but it only has running water and electricity; no sewerage.  Gioconda opened a locksmith shop thanks to her husband who worked for a welder 10 years ago.  However, because they did not pay him on time nor offer any benefits, he decided to use what he had learned and open his own shop.  He also began to teach his skills to Gioconda.  Now, Gioconda and her husband work from 8am to 5pm.  They buy solder, anti-rust paint, and black metal sheets.  Some of their better known customers bring their own raw materials in order to save a bit on costs.

S. has a general store in which she sells a little bit of everything, located in the Santa Ana neighborhood, next to the Walter Penki bridge. Se\u00f1ora M. needs financing to buy merchandise for her store, since she has almost no stock. She opens her business from 6 in the morning until 9 at night every day. She is a single mother. She has no dependents now. But she is a woman who likes to work hard and not depend on anyone. She has a regular job, which is to sweep the streets in part of the town in the early morning hours.

Nevertheless it bothers her that some of the drivers take advantage wanting to charge a high fee for transporting the fruit. Her business is profitableas she can easily cover her expenses and the superior education of her daughter. In the future she wants to buy a stall at the central market of the capital to secure her sales and have a stable place to sell her products. This is her tenth loan with MFP and the years she has been working with her community bank make her feel secure to continue working as there is respect and trust among everybody. Valetina plans to invest the money requested in buying more merchandise (vegetable, and local products.)\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Lene Struck Christensen, Kiva

She is married to Joseph L., a security guard, and is the mother to two young children, one of whom is just starting his elementary years while the youngest is still toddling around at home. By the grace of God, Concepcion has managed to support her child's schooling. At this time, she is working hard to be able to send both of her children all the way through college.\r\n\r\nConcepcion operates a variety store where electronic cellular phone load has been incorporated into the inventory. She also does sideline work, doing direct selling of clothing, footwear and cosmetics. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go for to buy one sachet of shampoo, a Php5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale price and selling in piece rate.  Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of Php300 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php9, 000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy more quantities of products like groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She will also invest a portion of the loan to buy electronic cellular phone time from different network providers. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n \r\nConcepcion dreams to be able to encourage her family to join her faith, because as she said, \u201cIt is hard to achieve your dream if you are not active in your relationship with the Lord\u201d.

She earns her living by operating 2 business ventures: a general store and a hog raising business.  Her husband Felix helps her run the businesses.  They have 6 children who are between 36 and 41 years old.  All of them now  have their own family. \r\n\r\nGloria joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2007 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 5 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Gloria has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 15000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 20000, uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 6 cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 15000, which she intends to use as working capital for her businesses so that she can continue to save up for future family needs. Gloria is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams.

She earns a minimum of 1,300 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operating her business, she is requesting a PHP 50,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nJoy hopes her business grows into a mini-grocery, just as she hopes to provide the daily needs of her family and give her children a good and high quality education through all her hard work on her business.

They all run small businesses that bring in a modest income. However, these women and everyone in their village face a serious problem as regards drinking-water, which is desperately lacking locally. The consequences are severe, with continuing elevated rates of diarrhea and related illnesses, as well as infant mortality, in the area. \r\n<p>\r\nFor reasons of health and daily life, these women are requesting a loan of $2,000 to drill a hole for a well. The resulting drinking water will be managed by the Association and sold to the population. This project therefore has not only an economic aspect but more importantly a humanitarian one, which merits support and financing. The conviction of these women, and especially their ability to manage and make their business activities profitable, is evidence that this project will be a fine achievement for the well-being of the entire village and its surrounding area.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>Translated from French by Daniel KUEY\/J,V.

After the separation, she decided to open a tire repair shop in the outskirts of the city.  She thought it was a good business venture, but things did not turn out as she had expected. <p>\r\n\r\nFlor decided to try another business idea and opened a general store\/catering service in her home.

History of note includes: it was once a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; the birthplace of the great Persian poet Rudaki; and the birthplace of the most famous Islamic philosopher Ibn Sina (Avicenna). The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p> \r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n<p>\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients have a viable business proposition when they request a loan. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and IMON will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. It is also a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nTajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She enjoys playing various roles being a woman. But apart from being a child who supports her parents, a supportive housewife and a loving mother to her 16-year-old child and grandmother to her six-year-old grandchild, what challenges her most is her role being a poor woman wanting to rise from poverty. Her membership in ASHI and the opportunity of getting a loan from that institution makes her feel hopeful that someday her dreams will come true.\r\n\r\nDespite her busy schedule in managing and growing her small canteen, which was put up through the loans she received from ASHI, Merlyn makes sure that she can always attend ASHI\u2019s weekly center meeting where she pays her weekly amortization, meeting her group members as well as the rest of the members of ASHI in their center. This is because Merlyn treasures the opportunity she has able to obtain because of ASHI. Now that ASHI has partnered with Kiva, Merlyn\u2019s hope of expanding her business is strengthened. She is requesting a much larger loan to grow her canteen. Through the profits of her business, she wishes to support the education of her child and grandchild who live with her, until they graduate from college.  \r\n\r\nFor a microfinance that uses Grameen methodology, ASHI being the first practitioner in the field saw how these poor women mothers work hard to earn money for the cash flow of her family and to provide her children a better life.

She is married to Frank, 35, and they have three children. They live together in harmony in their own home. Olga and her husband are the pillars for their children, who from a very early age were taught how to tend the land. Olga is a farmer and has four hectares of land where she cultivates coffee and cocoa, plants that originated from the rain forest area in the Apurimac River Valley. She has been dedicated to this activity for the past 11 years, and at harvest time she counts on the support of hired laborers to harvest the crops and transport them to to be dried. What she likes most about her work is harvesting the plants since she can see her months of hard work be repaid with quality fruit. The task she considers to be the most difficult is transporting the products from her community to the commercial centers where she sells her items. In the future she wants to purchase more land and expand her coffee production. This is her fifth loan with Kiva partner MFP, and she feels proud to have repaid every loan punctually since she doesn't want to cause problems for her much loved fellow members of her community bank. With the loan and her accumulated savings, she plans to purchase a plot of land in the city of Santa

During this time of year families buy these for all of the girls in the house, and for the boys, they buy cookies in the form of a horse with the ceramic face of a little pony.  These cookies are purchased by those who have a child in the household; this tradition is almost an obligation in our country.  \n\nLisbeth is grateful for this loan, and she is committed to making her payments according to the established schedule."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":905088,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bakery","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy flour, yeast, sprinkles, and cookies with little faces to make the traditional \"gua gua\" bread.\r\n\r\n","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"CUSCO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.518333 -71.978056","type":"point"}},"partner_id":119,"posted_date":"2011-10-27T01:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lisbet Mayra","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-10-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":235.81},{"due_date":"2011-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":245.16},{"due_date":"2012-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":254.88},{"due_date":"2012-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":264.15}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":88.43},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.93},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":95.58},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":99.06}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":88.43,"local_amount":235.81,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:20:22Z","rounded_local_amount":240.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244511488},{"amount":91.93,"local_amount":245.16,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T09:26:41Z","rounded_local_amount":249.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250718939},{"amount":95.58,"local_amount":254.88,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T09:36:20Z","rounded_local_amount":259.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257121475},{"amount":99.06,"local_amount":264.15,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T08:39:46Z","rounded_local_amount":269.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263246410}],"funded_date":"2011-10-27T22:05:37Z","paid_date":"2012-03-15T08:39:46Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lisa Grobar","image":264298}},{"id":355822,"name":"Wilma","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Wilma is 45 years old and lives in Upper Loboc, Oroquieta City.

She is married and has three children. She enjoys her work of fattening up livestock. This trade has a lot of obstacles and difficulties, because the livestock might fall ill if they are not vaccinated in time, or given other necessary medicine. If they are badly taken care of and poorly fed, the livestock might lose weight and not produce offspring. Thus her husband and son help her with the business. \r\n\r\nRaqiba is a positive woman, and she has a large and amiable family. Raqiba has to work a lot in order to support her family. She works in animal husbandry and milk processing. Her husband helps her with this business. They spend the income received from raising cattle and selling milk on their family, and some goes to helping their elderly parents. \r\n\r\nRaqiba wants to give her children a good education. This is her dream, since she herself was unable to receive a good education. In order to make her dreams a reality, she must work even more and augment her business. In order to increase her herd she needs a small sum of money.

Her parents separated when she was only 5 years old, and she started living with her father. She attended school until the 10th grade, and at the age of 19 she met her husband, with whom she would have 2 children. At the age of 23 she decided to start a business to increase the family's income. She worked several jobs and was most successful selling clothes, which she practices to this day. She thought about renting a store where she could sell her clothes, but she had insufficient funds. Through a friend, she met Hluvuku and asked for a loan of 1,2000 dollars to continue with her store project, having decided to work arduously at building savings to help her further her store. <p> This business has a positive impact on her family, helping her husband support their children and allowing them to purchase a car, which will greatly help her business in traveling for purchases to South Africa and in her deliveries. Her business' impact on the community is also positive. By supplying clothing at reasonable prices to her community, she saves her neighbors time and money from travelling to South Africa. Selling clothes door-to-door is very demanding, and in the future, she intends to build a shop where she can display her clothing. <p> <b>Translated from Portuguese by Marco Alves, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nHercilia Madalena T., nascida em 27 de julho de 1975 em Maputo, seus pais separam se quando ela tinha apenas 5 anos e passou a viver com o pai.

He currently has two children, Intan and Noval, and his income is what ensures their survival.  In 2002, the Bali bombings almost completely destroyed the Balinese economy.  One of the hardest-hit industries was tourism.  After the bombings, hotels had to lay off many of their employees. Unfortunately, due to the circumstances, I Putu Agus Sumerta was let go from his job at a hotel in Denpasar.  Like many others, he had to return to his home village to begin looking for a new source of income.  He decided to go into the clothes tailoring business.  To learn the trade, he studied with his mother, at the home where he was born, in the village of Candikusuma.  With a completely manual sewing machine (they have no electricity), he is now able to make a full outfit worth 40,000 Rupiah in just one 8am to 5pm work day.  He has been very successful in his business, gaining more customers every day.  For major holidays he has lines of customers waiting to put in orders.  In fact, due to the limitations of the tools he is using, he is having to decline more and more customers because he is afraid he won't be able to complete their orders on time.  I Putus Agus Sumerta would like to borrow 2,000,000 Rupiah to purchase a Dynamo electric generator that he can attach to his sewing machine to increase his production and therefore better help his family meet their day-to-day needs.  His oldest daughter is in her final year of primary school, and he also wants to use his increased income to pay for her continued education.\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Bahasa Indonesia by Courtenay Teska Race, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nSebagai Kepala keluarga yang harus bertanggung jawab dalam memenuhi seluruh kebutuhan keluarganya , I Putu Agus Sumerta  yang kini telah di karuniai dua orang anak yakni Intan & Noval sangat memerlukan pekerjaan  yang bisa menjamin kelangsungan hidup keluarga. Hal itu sebenarnya sudah pernah terwujud ,sebelum suatu kejadian (Bom Bali )terjadi,yang membuat hampir seluruh perekonomian di bali terpuruk , khususnya dalam bidang perhotelan .Banyak hotel maupun usaha yang berkaitan dengan pariwisata mengalami kebangkrutan yang Berdampak pada pemutusan hubungan kerja. Seperti yang terjadi terhadap  Putu Agus Sumerta.Mantan seorang karyawan salah satu hotel di Denpasar ini harus rela balik kekampungnya dan harus memulai mencari sumber pendapatan  yang baru . Menjahit pakaian menjadi pilihan Putu Agus ,ketrampilan yang di peroleh dari Ibu kandungnya itu di jalankannya di rumah tempat kelahirannya yaitu di desa Candikusuma . Dengan mesin jahit manual (tanpa tenaga penggerak listrik) dalam sehari Putu Agus bisa menyelesaikan satu stel pakaian dengan ongkos\/upah sebesar Rp 40.000,- ini di kerjakan mulai jam 8 pagi sampai jam 5 sore.   Hasil jaritan Putu Agus Sangat baik sehingga pelangganyapun bertambah banyak lebih lebih menjelang hari raya banyak pelanggan yang  antri untuk di buatkan Baju maupun pakaian lainya . Bahkan tak jarang Putu agus harus menolak pesanan karena takut tak bisa menyelesaikan tepat waktu karena keterbatasan alat yang dimiliki.       \r\nPutu Agus memerlukan pinjaman modal dari Dinari sebesar Rp 2 .000.000,- untuk membeli Dinamo listrik yang dipasangkan pada mesinjahitnya sebagai tenaga pengerak Agar hasil produksinya meningkat dan pendapatannya juga bertambah Sehingga dapat  memenuhi kebutuhan sehari-hari dan juga untuk biaya pendidikan putri sulungnya yang sekarang sudah kelas 5

She lives in her own home with her husband Oscar, 29, and she works with him on a farm.  Together, they want to provide a better life for their beloved son, Aldair.  Working arduously each day in their fields, Marcela is changing their lives.  With her husband she plants beans, corn, and gladioli, which they sell in the markets of Tarma and La Merced, since this is where they can obtain the best prices.  What she likes most about her work is to care for the plantings so that they remain free of diseases and pests.  She has been doing this work for 19 years, and what she considers most difficult is to take her products to the markets where they are sold, since she must carry sacks that are very heavy.  In the future, she hopes to improve her crops and in this way obtain better prices.

Her father was a fisherman and her mother sold fish.\r\n\r\nEach time the river rose they had to leave their home because it would end up under water.  Back then there was still no retaining wall.  Isabel could only study up to her third year of secondary education because when she was 15 her father abandoned the family and, as the eldest daughter, she had to work to help her mom raise her siblings.\r\n\r\nMaria Isabel started working as a cleaner.  At the age of 19 she had her first child and had to go and work on a farm stay as a cook in order to be able to raise her child.\r\n\r\nIsabel currently lives in San Francisco neighborhood, in the city of Concepci\u00f3n with her partner, 32 year-old Carlos Alberto, who works as an assistant chainsaw operator.  They have two children: 15 year-old Daysi and 8 year-old Jos\u00e9 Miguel.  She currently works selling clothes and shoes.\r\n\r\nIsabel is a member of the 'Grupo Unidas' committee which has 19 members who all want to escape the poverty that they live in with their families.  However, in order to achieve this they need the financial help of Kiva through Fundaci\u00f3n Paraguaya.  They are requesting this loan so that they can make progress, make more income and enjoy a better quality of life.  Isabel will invest her loan in buying clothes and shoes for resale, bearing in mind that purchasing goods in large quantities reduces costs and increases

She thus requested financial support in the amount of $550 which was paid back without incident.  \r\nMiss Akou\u00e9l\u00e9 Christine T. has requested a new credit of $900 that will be used as capital for purchasing and selling soap, perfume and imported drinks. This will increase her revenue and allow her to meet the needs of her family.\r\n\r\n<p><p> <b>Translated from French by Lisa Molle, a Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\r\nMlle T.

The reality of their lives makes  any woman who wants to improve the quality of life for her family a real fighter.   This group of women maintains the customs and traditions of Cerro de Oro.   As you see in the photos, all of the women wear a traditional skirt with great pride, and most wear the traditional blouse.   The mother tongue for these women is Maya Tzutujil, but many of them speak Spanish well.  <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>All of the women work in textiles.  Half of them used their loan to buy thread for making the traditional skirts.  These skirts are the same as you see in the photos.  The other half used the money to buy clothing to resell.  Several of the women earn money buying and selling American style clothing, while others sell the traditional clothing.  <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the nice characteristics of this group is that the loan obligations are shared.  They are all requesting similar amounts of money, and they are growing their businesses at the same time.   This helps make it a cohesive group, as the women feel they are all more or less at the same level.  <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The women feel that it's important to work with the methodology of the communal banks, because other forms of credit wouldn't be available to them.  The majority of them don't have much to use as collateral, so the loans via communal banks work well for them. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>These women share the dream of improving the quality of life for their families.  The situation in which they live is not ideal for the optimal development of their children, as the community lacks good services.    This is why through Kiva, we can help these women realize their dreams and continue to help their families.  <\/p>\r\n\r\n<\/p> Translated by Kiva volunteer Emily Charnes <\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<P>Las mujeres del grupo Flor del Cerro 2 son unas personas emprendedoras. La realidad en la que viven las mujeres en Cerro de Oro hace a cualquier mujer que quiere salir adelante junto con su familia una verdadera luchadora. \r\n\r\n<P>Este grupo de se\u00f1oras mantienen las costumbres tradicionales de Cerro de Oro. Como se puede ver en la foto todas las se\u00f1oras lucen su corte, o falda tradicional, con mucho orgullo, y todas excepto una lucen sus m\u00e1gicos huipiles o blusas. La lengua materna de estas mujeres es el Maya Tzutujil, sin embargo algunas tienen la facilidad de desenvolverse bien en el idioma espa\u00f1ol. \r\n\r\n<P>Todas las se\u00f1oras trabajan en el \u00e1rea textil. La mitad de ellas invierten su cr\u00e9dito en la compra de hilo para elaborar los huipiles tradicionales de Cerro de Oro. Estos huipiles se asemejan a los que ellas mismas lucen en la foto. La otra mitad de se\u00f1oras invierten su cr\u00e9dito en la compra de ropa para su reventa. Algunas de ellas trabajan comprando y vendiendo ropa americana, mientras que otras revenden ropa tradicional. \r\n\r\n\r\n<P>Una de las buenas caracter\u00edsticas de este grupo es que en general el rango de pr\u00e9stamos es reducido. Las mujeres est\u00e1n sacando una cantidad de dinero similar. Esto implica que las mujeres se est\u00e1n desarrollando empresarialmente al mismo tiempo. Este rasgo ayuda a la cohesi\u00f3n del grupo, ya que las mujeres sienten que todas est\u00e1n al mismo nivel. \r\n\r\n\r\n<P>Las se\u00f1oras sienten que es realmente importante trabajar bajo la metodolog\u00eda de bancos comunales porque de otra forma ellas no podr\u00edan acceder a un cr\u00e9dito. La mayor\u00eda de ellas no tienen muchas pertenencias o escrituras que pueden dejar como colateral, es por eso que trabajar bajo esta metodolog\u00eda se les hace muy conveniente. \r\n\r\n\r\n<P>El sue\u00f1o de estas mujeres es el de sacar a sus familias adelante. La situaci\u00f3n en la que viven estas mujeres no es ideal para el \u00f3ptimo desarrollo de sus hijos e hijas debido a la falta de buenos servicios en la comunidad. Es por eso que nosotros por medio de Kiva, las tenemos que ayudar para que ellas as\u00ed puedan cumplir su sue\u00f1o, sacar a su familia adelante."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2000,"image":{"id":157527,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing

His wife works as a teacher in a secondary school. Domullo has been working as a traffic cop for twelve years, but has retired early due to worsened health. His pension is not enough to cover life expenses and this is why he decided to start a business by raising and reselling cattle. He is familiar with this business and has done it before, but now he is fully devoting his time to cattle. His health has improved a great deal and he is ready to continue his work. To increase the working capital he decided to get a loan. His wife is pictured here because Domullo himself was not present during the screening session. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Russian by Elena Fedorchuk, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":301547,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy a cattle","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Khujand","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"40.28 69.631667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":47,"posted_date":"2009-04-11T06:20:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":800,"lender_count":28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Domullo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-04-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2009-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2009-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2010-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2010-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":600}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":160},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":160},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":160},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":160},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":160}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":160,"local_amount":600,"processed_date":"2009-10-08T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-04T09:28:47Z","rounded_local_amount":612.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97000834},{"amount":160,"local_amount":600,"processed_date":"2009-11-08T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-25T09:22:02Z","rounded_local_amount":612.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103846211},{"amount":160,"local_amount":600,"processed_date":"2009-12-08T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-10T08:42:17Z","rounded_local_amount":612.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110737312},{"amount":160,"local_amount":600,"processed_date":"2010-01-08T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-06T08:21:23Z","rounded_local_amount":612.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118127043},{"amount":160,"local_amount":600,"processed_date":"2010-02-08T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-06T08:21:34Z","rounded_local_amount":612.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123964053}],"funded_date":"2009-04-19T19:04:20Z","paid_date":"2010-04-06T08:21:34Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Elena Fedorchuk","image":1104450}},{"id":105018,"name":"Sem's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This small loan group is formed by two borrowers and Mr. Sem V., aged 30, is the group leader.

She is married and has four school-aged children.  To make a living, Ni Wayan Suweli owns & operates a general store.  While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling both food & daily use products in the local community.  Ni Wayan Suweli has been engaged in this business for over seven years and earns approximately 750,000 IDR a month from these activities.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Ni Wayan Suweli joined DINARI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.

They are the reason she puts forth so much effort to succeed.  Her business is located in one of the most central parks in the city of Juliaca.  Her snack stand is one of the busiest, given that it is well stocked and people know that they will find what they are looking for there.  This has made her business very profitable, and motivates her to dedicate herself fully to it.\r\n\r\nWhat she enjoys most about her work is chatting with her customers, as this helps ease the burden of all the long workdays.  She has been carrying out this activity for 2 years, and she considers the most challenging aspect of her business to be at her stall all day long without pause.  Over time, she hopes to rent a site in the same area where she could provide a higher level of service to her patrons.\r\n\r\nThis is the fifth loan that Lucia has accessed with MFP, and she knows that the funds will help her improve her future prospects.  However, she also knows she must make her payments on time in order to not create any problems for her cooperative bank.

Her other 4 children are adults and are already independent.\r\n\r\nOne year ago she set up a small food store in a room of her house, since in the neighborhood where she lives there is no competition.

Susana likes her work very much, since it is quiet and she can interact with her neighbors and acquaintances.  She currently sells a little bit of everything, from basic necessities to soft drinks and beer, which she sells a lot of during the weekends.\r\n\r\nAnd, being a hardworking woman, she has plans for the future to expand the facilities of her store and put in some tables and chairs for the comfort of her customers when they want something to drink.\r\n\r\nThis is her 13th loan with MFP and she is very grateful to all of the people who have made her loan possible so that she can continue working to get ahead.  At the same time she is very content with the work of her group because it is made up of people who are very responsible and punctual in their payments.  Susana plans to use the money she now requests to buy a greater quantity of merchandise for her store, since she wants to restock it with a greater variety of products to offer the best to her

This association was founded in 1993 by twenty women entrepreneurs to increase their purchasing power by way of a tontine (a revolving credit system in which each member periodically pays a suitable amount and which funds its various members by turns). This policy does not allow every member to be financed on the same day. \r\n\r\nThe members decided to join IMCEC in order to award loans without guarantee requirements. Thus, the members are divided into sub-groups of five, each with a designated president and a treasurer. These sub-groups, which are called Takku Liggey in the Medina Fall branch, can be the same for several years but often change their members according to the financing of needs and other considerations. \r\n\r\nThe AFDE organizes member meetings each month, when all the sub-groups and branches are invited. It facilitates cooperation for its members, enabling them to buy rice and other goods at better prices. The AFDE is lead by a president by the name of Ms. Mame Diarra MAR and by a treasurer, Ms. Ndeye Ndella Diouf , both residents of Thi\u00e8s.\r\n\r\nThus, the sub-group Takky Liggey n\u00b0 30 regroups five women in the same business. They sell charcoal and firewood under the control of the Water Affairs and Forestry department to avoid contributing (as they say) to the degradation of nature. This loan allows them to develop their activity and reinforce solidarity through their group deposit. The sub-group is led by Ms. Tabara Tiagne, 50 years old and mother of seven children. This lady knows the business and has an accumulated six years\u2019 experience. She is joined in this group by the Treasurer Ms. Anta Gu\u00e8ne, Ms. Ndeye Ndella L., Ms. Ouzine L. and Ms. Khady B..\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Ren\u00e9 McConnell, Kiva

She is a single mother with 2 children who are reliant on her: 11 year-old Roberto Mario, who they call Tito, and Linda Patricia (Pati), who is 6. And the baby who will be born in a few months will be a girl, and she is eager to hold her in her arms. \r\nShe has been an elementary school teacher for 11 years. She teaches in a community called Madero, which is some distance from where she lives. But she is still doing well and has been able to help her family get ahead. People treat her well thanks to the service that she gives to her students and they don't want her to leave her work for any reason because she is a good person.\r\nShe says that she requested a loan to buy materials for her craft production, being: thread, rings, wood, and needles to make hammocks, bags, landscape pictures, and swings. She has been doing this work for 10 months and says that it is going well as her customers buy in bulk and she gives them payment schemes.  \r\nWith the income that she makes from her sales, she buys more material so she can make more crafts, and every day she has more income and will be able to repay the loan that she is requesting from Fundac\u00edon Realidad and the loan will give her better work opportunities. \r\nShe wants to be able to save so that in time she can build a larger house and make her children comfortable. She also wants to have a stationary store where she can sell high-quality goods. She wants this so her children can have a good education and good future.  \r\nMacarena became part of the group when her friend, Flor Delva, who is the group's representative for the loan, invited her. She was interested because the loan payments are easy and the interest is low, so she joined. The group is called \"Ori\u00f3n\" because where they work there is a street of that name. \r\nThere are 4 women in the group and each has a different business, being:\r\nMacarena will use the loan to buy materials to make crafts such as hammocks, swings, pictures, and bags. \r\nFlor Delva will use the loan to buy and sell shoes, sandals, and women's bags.\r\nMar\u00eda Elid\u00eda will use the loan to buy catalogs to sell shoes from the Impulso and Maga brands.\r\nAdalia will use the loan to buy catalogs from Fuller, Jafra, and Blondy to sell perfumes, deodorants, and other goods.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Alison Hynd, Kiva

He lives in the municipality of Malambo, where he raises chickens and pigs. He learned this business more than 12 years ago, thanks to the fact that he always accompanied his father when he was transporting feed for a business that raised and sold chickens. Thus, together with his brothers, he began with 10 poultry sheds in the yard of his house and 100 chickens. As the business grew, he achieved commercial successes such as becoming registered as a supplier for a state enterprise. However, with these achievements also came great challenges: for instance, there were problems with electricity and water in his poultry sheds and he suffered some losses. Because of this, three years ago Alfredo decided to move his business with the help of a family member, relocating it to a lane with all of the necessary conditions to raise animals appropriately. This made his work easier, and now he is more at ease and enthusiastic about increasing the productivity of his business. He has joined with the National Learning Service, SENA, where he participates in a community project providing technical consulting for raising and fattening animals. His loan with Kiva is the first with the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation, and he needs it to buy 500 chickens, 9 packages of concentrated feed, 65 laying hens, and 10 pigs. This will allow him to increase his working capital and expand his commercial coverage to 1000 chickens, in order to increase his income.

This will be her 6th loan with MFP. She needs a lot of help to achieve her goals. Lida loves to work with her village bank because they are people who are always around her and share the same ideals. With the loan money, Lida will be able to buy manure for her coffee and plantain crops, which costs 120 soles per bag.

Homero is titled the El Paso Business Coach. This is a name his son titled him with to bring in more business. H. Homero said he has witnessed small businesses struggle, stay small, and sometimes, flop. This encouraged him to begin The Ascend: Entrepreneurial Growth. The company is almost three years old now. H. Homero noticed a need to build a stronger economy and stop the cost of business. \u201cWe won\u2019t build our economy if we don\u2019t build ourselves,\u201d he stated. The Ascend: Entrepreneurial Growth assists in coaching small businesses on maturity, building infrastructure and creating a system to ensure a business works as an organization.\r\n\r\nThrough his business, H. Homero offers a workshop at no cost to local business owners entitled: \u201cBlueprint for Business Growth.\u201d He, as well, has others that he charges for. H. Homero\u2019s main advantage is the offered one-on-one coaching of his clients and reasonable price compared to major franchise groups. Since he offers the one-on-one coaching, H. Homero\u2019s assistance is client-limited. Because of this, he works with anywhere from a dozen to 20 clients annually. \r\n\r\nThe current hindrance for H. Homero\u2019s business is his marketing presence. H. Homero stressed the complications of working with minor businesses. He said, \u201cThe trick is to bring (his coaching) to those who can\u2019t afford it.\u201d H. Homero expressed that he would love to decrease his prices for those who want and need his help, but at the moment, he cannot afford to do so. H. Homero requested the loan to purchase office equipment and market his business. His primary goal for The Ascend: Entrepreneurial Growth has not been as dramatically accomplished as he expected, he said, however the loan from ACCION Texas has helped. A returning client, H. Homero said one of things that happens as a small business is that projects and advancements such as purchasing software or other supplies are put off until capital is earned, which in turn, holds the business process. \u201cThe loan helps me grow the business now,\u201d he said.\r\n\r\nH. Homero\u2019s work involves educating other entrepreneurs. He said the company is trying to break ground and bring people to his office. As he noticed, other businesses are using their profit to pay franchised business coaches to teach them rudimentary skills they really do not need to pay for. He added: 89 percent of small business owners are sole proprietors leaving that one person to cover every expense and find solutions to every problem, something he is familiar with. H. Homero is also a sole proprietor of his business who sometimes collaborates with other successful business owners. He, too, has learned about small business and entrepreneurship by conducting first-hand interviews with now household names of different industries. \r\nTo find out more about H. Homero and his business, visit his website at: http:\/\/www.ascendeg.com.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients have solid business propositions. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Shahnaz baji wants a loan to buy clothes for her cloth selling business.\r\n\r\nThis is a group loan. The loan funds will be distributed among the group members, each of whom will invest in her own business. The members mutually guarantee one another's loans. If one member does not repay, the other members are responsible.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":850,"image":{"id":321332,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Transportation","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"To

Her children are what motivate her to do all she does.\r\n\r\nMyrho\u2019s days are long and arduous.  She walks the streets of Julilaca distributing boxes of liquor to various stores and warehouses.  She also brings her merchandise to districts outside of Puno.  This business is beneficial for Myrho and she takes advantage of her free moments to take care of her household chores.  She has been doing this for five years and what she likes least is having to walk so much because it makes her weak and too tired to sell with much gusto.  But she knows she has to do this to get ahead.\r\n\r\nIn the near future, she would like to have her own business in an established place \u2013 possibly a grocery store.  She hasn\u2019t decided exactly what it will be yet.  This is her third loan with MFP and she expects to be able to make her payments on time so she doesn\u2019t cause any problems for the other members of her communal bank.  She is well respected because she is so responsible.  She will increase the merchandise she sells with the 1, 500 she has requested in order to improver her earnings.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Shelly Hubman, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":329794,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Incremento de mercader\u00eda","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Juliaca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15.5 -70.133333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-06-07T01:40:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":525,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Myrho","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-05-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-06-08T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:38:45Z","rounded_local_amount":259.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52990702},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-07-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:39:44Z","rounded_local_amount":259.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63211804},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-08-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:18:33Z","rounded_local_amount":259.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73641329},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-09-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:29:43Z","rounded_local_amount":259.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87080768},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-10-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T02:59:48Z","rounded_local_amount":259.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96996908},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-11-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:53:02Z","rounded_local_amount":259.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103842248}],"funded_date":"2009-06-11T01:40:39Z","paid_date":"2009-12-15T13:53:02Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Shelly Hubman","image":226625}},{"id":117322,"name":"Merlita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Merlita O. is from the city of Pandan, Gingoog City.

average of four children each; they live in polygamous families in Comorow, one of the villages in the municipality of Loulouni, which lies in the sub-prefecture of Loulouni, the third administrative region of Mali.\r\n\r\nThey collaborate with the microfinance institution, Soro Yiriwaso, in order to manage successfully their agricultural activities during the winter season. They are on their fourth loan from the institution, having repaid the three previous loans correctly.\r\n\r\nThe crops cultivated by the group are sugar peas and rice. Djeneba D. is planning to use her loan to buy agricultural intrants and small equipment, as well as recruiting workers to maintain her hectare of land. The harvested crop is sold to a customer base made up of men and women.

But they live on their own in the rural community of Santa Clara (in the Peruvian mountain range). Some years ago their son started University at Ica (in the coastal regions of Peru) and according to Carlos, it was then when their dreams and aspirations changed.  When he was 17 years old he started work in agriculture and in those days he worked with great zeal on his plantations of potatoes, peas, and fava beans. His plantations were successful and generated great earnings. In time he started a family and since then he has seen an improvement in his earnings. With the funds he saved he managed to purchase more farmland. Today Carlos is able to sell potatoes in very large quantities. He states \"with these harvests I was able to send my son to school\".  He plans on buying a small house in the city of Ica to be closer to their son. There they plan on opening a small grocery store.  This is his fourth loan with MFP (Kiva Field Partner) and he is grateful for the support he has received through all this time. With these loans he was able to find many successes and much happiness.

is a 45-year-old man. He is married to Lea and has been blessed with 4 children: Marlin, 23 years old and married; Randy, 20 years old and disabled due to an accident and unable to complete his high school education; Dewi, graduated from senior high school but currently unemployed; Juan, 10 years old and in 4th grade. Danny and his family live in their simple house located in Kolhua Village. \r\n\r\nTo generate daily income, Danny runs a small kiosk. Using the small amount of money that he has, Danny purchases various daily basic needs such as soap, toothpaste, snacks, cigarettes, etc. Danny relies on the profit from his kiosk to meet his family's needs. \r\n\r\nDanny's kiosk is located about 20 meters from the main road and is quite difficult for his customers to reach. This poor location has greatly affected his income. Danny serves just a few customers and can only generate a small income, which he spends to replace his business stock, buy food and pay for electricity and other expenses. Danny feels that his income is very small. As head of the family, he keeps thinking about how to improve his business and generate more income. He believes the solution lies in enlarging his kiosk and finding a strategic location but Danny doesn't have enough capital to do so. \r\n\r\nDanny has tried to find a loan to help him improve his business. Fortunately, he met TLM\u2019s Field Officer who introduced him to TLM\u2019s lending program. Danny is interested in joining the individual program and is requesting a loan of IDR 10,000,000. Danny is hoping to get the loan so he can implement his plan."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1125,"image":{"id":713771,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to
