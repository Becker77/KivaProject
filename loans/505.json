They live in large traditional extended families with their children, husbands, parents-in-law, sisters-in-law, etc. They have an average age of 40 and at least 5 children.  They grow mainly rice, and they grown peanuts as a secondary business.  \r\n\r\nConcerned about making their farms profitable, the group members decided to join the Soro Yiriwaso loan program four years ago.  After having correctly repaid the three preceding loans, they are now on their fourth farm loan.  \r\n\r\nThe current loan will be used to buy a sufficient quantity of seeds for planting rice and peanuts, some minor supplies and equipment, and fertilizers and such, for farming.  Supplies are gotten at the marketplaces of Zansoni, M\u2019pessoba, and Fonfona.  Following the off-season, the crops are stored for a certain time, so that they gain in value.  Then the crops are sold retail and wholesale in cash transactions at the M\u2019pessoba and Koutiala markets.  Their customers come generally from large cities.  \r\n\r\nAfter selling their produce, the group members each intend to realize a profit of 65,000 francs CFA that will be used to repay the loan and to cover common family expenses.  \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":975,"image":{"id":330780,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"To buy fertilizers, seeds, and minor supplies and equipment","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Koutiala","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:24Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":975,"lender_count":28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Fatoumata Warazi\u00e9","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fanta ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kadia Noumoudjon ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kadia Moussa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bintou Amadou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Wassa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kadia Ladji ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Awa Sidi ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dj\u00e9n\u00e9ba Nagagnon ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-05-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":450000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":975,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":450000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":975}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":975,"local_amount":450000,"processed_date":"2010-03-07T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:59:47Z","rounded_local_amount":451474.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":129021274}],"funded_date":"2009-07-11T10:50:12Z","paid_date":"2010-04-15T09:59:47Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Daniel Kuey","image":669418}},{"id":117726,"name":"Zenaida","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Zenaida M. is from San Isidro, Medina, Misamis Oriental.

differentiates him from other local residents and makes him stand out as a well-respected and very important member of his community. Farming requires a lot of effort which is why, from a young age, Akbarali has dedicated himself to this business and today is seeking a way to expand his efforts in order to support his family which consists of his wife and a little son.\r\n\r\nBecause his crop provides the main income for the family, Akbarali is seeking a loan of 3,000 Somoni to plow more farmland and purchase seeds and fertilizer. The loan will allow him to expand his farming business. Akbarali hopes the loan will increase his family's income. He hopes you will support him and thanks you for your generosity.\r\n \r\n\r\n<b>More about Tajikistan and IMON International<\/b>\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Ellos viven en su casa propia. Desde que era muy peque\u00f1a aprendi\u00f3 todos los trucos y habilidades para tejer bonitas prendas, actividad que actualmente realiza para mantener a su familia. A ella le gusta mucho su trabajo, porque puede disponer del tiempo para realizar esta actividad, ahora contratan su servicio, para que realice la cantidad necesaria de prendas en una fecha determinada, es por ello que veces trabaja de noche, mientras que en las ma\u00f1anas atiende a sus hijos. Todos los tejidos que elabora son exportados hacia otros pa\u00edses, como China, por tal motivo, su trabajo es muy agotador, ya que debe tejer de 10 a 25 chompas. Es as\u00ed que lleva 11 a\u00f1os de trabajo, ganando experiencia y perseverancia y espera con el tiempo poner un negocio m\u00e1s estable, como instalar una puesto en un mercado muy concurrido; aunque hace algunos a\u00f1os intento hacerlo, vendiendo productos comestibles en su casa, sin embargo no funcion\u00f3, ya que la zona en la que vive no era muy concurrida, pero espera tener suerte esta vez. Este es su primer cr\u00e9dito con MFP y se compromete a ser muy puntual con sus pagos. Con el cr\u00e9dito que solicita, desea comprar material para sus tejidos y poder ganar m\u00e1s y ahorrar y obtener una maquina que le facilite y ahorre tiempo en el tejido.\n\n","en":"Eidencia is 40 years old. She lives in her own home with her children Jessica, age 22, Elsiza, age 18, Nildo, age 13,  Denilson, age 12, and Tatiana, age 5.\r\n\r\nSince the time she was very young, Eidencia has learned the craft of knitting beautiful clothes, including all the tricks of the trade. Now she uses these skills to support her family. \r\n\r\nEidencia really likes her work because it allows her to  manage her own time; her services are now in demand, and she has contracts that request predetermined quantities of her products by a certain date. To get it done, Eidencia sometimes works nights, and in the morning takes care of her children. All the products she makes are exported to other countries, for example China, and making them is quite tiring since she has to knit 10 to 25 sweaters. \r\n\r\nEidencia has been working this way for eleven years, gaining in experience and perseverance and hopes that, with time, she'll be able to develop a more established business - for instance, she would like to have a vending post in a well-attended marketplace. She already tried to do this several years ago, trying to sell groceries from her home, but it wasn't successful since the area where she lives didn't have a lot of customers. However, Eidencia hopes that next time it will work out. \r\n\r\nThis is her first loan with MFP, and Eidencia is committed to be timely with her repayments. The loan she is requesting will be used to buy materials for her knitting; she hopes to earn more and save more and purchase a weaving machine that would allow her to use time more effectively in her knitting.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Andrei Vazhnov, Kiva

Once her mother stopped working as an employee at clothes making satellite firms she decided to give her entrepreneurial spirit free range by setting up her own business taking advantage of all her experience to generate family and independent income.  This was how she invested all her savings from her severance pay to set up this production spot in her own home with her daughter.\r\n\r\nSo, while Beatriz undertakes securing contracts, her mother works designing, preparing, assembling and finishing pieces that become outfits for women, men and children.  Her main customers are located in downtown Barranquilla at commercial spots and also in schools that Beatriz has managed to contact to offer them their services.\r\n\r\nBeatriz and her mother are interested in making their business grow so they\u2019ve called on Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo to get their first Kiva loan that they\u2019ll use to buy raw materials and supplies like fabric, buttons, zippers and thread, because they need to respond to orders from their customers and buying in bulk is more profitable because they save on the purchases with discounts that their suppliers offer.\r\n\r\nHer goal is to structure the business well and, above all, to have a properly structured house of her own where she can add a special space for her micro firm; this is precisely her great challenge.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":825,"image":{"id":779207,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to buy sewing supplies.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2011-05-28T02:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":825,"lender_count":33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Beatriz Elena ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-05-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":825,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":104697},{"due_date":"2011-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":114371},{"due_date":"2011-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":116563},{"due_date":"2011-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":118797},{"due_date":"2011-11-05T07:00:00Z","amount":121074},{"due_date":"2011-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":123394},{"due_date":"2012-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":125760},{"due_date":"2012-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":128170},{"due_date":"2012-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":130626},{"due_date":"2012-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":133130},{"due_date":"2012-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":135682},{"due_date":"2012-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":147736}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.58},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.91},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.11},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65.34},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.59},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":67.86},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":69.17},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.49},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.85},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.22},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.63},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":57.58,"local_amount":104697,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:49:34Z","rounded_local_amount":105089.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221673779},{"amount":62.91,"local_amount":114371,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-17T08:02:23Z","rounded_local_amount":114799.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227320337},{"amount":129.45,"local_amount":235360,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:17:37Z","rounded_local_amount":236242.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238614540},{"amount":575.06,"local_amount":1045081,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T10:20:30Z","rounded_local_amount":1049000.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257188247}],"funded_date":"2011-06-01T02:47:02Z","paid_date":"2012-02-15T10:20:30Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":307064,"name":"Melinda","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Melinda is 38 years old and lives in the Philippines.

Marrion is 16 years old and lives in the town of Hima in the Fort Portal region of Uganda. For the past two years, Marrion has been working hard to manage her pharmacy, which provides medicine and basic treatments to local patients. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Marrion has requested a loan of 300,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to purchase more medicines to sell in her shop, and will help Marrion to generate greater profits and pay her brother's school fees. Marrion hopes that in the future she will be able to buy a plot of land and build a house. \r\n\r\nMarrion is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills training. The ELA program has increased Marrion's future prospects by helping her to learn how to save money and manage her finances."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":898075,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pharmacy","sector":"Health","themes":null,"use":"to

By the leadership of Emily as their facilitator, this group joined One Acre Fund in the year 2011 and will re-enroll in the 2012 program. \r\n\r\nEmily takes care of seven children at home. She joined One Acre Fund in order to access fertilizer and hybrid seeds and ensure food security for her family. In the recent 2011 season, she had a very good maize yield harvesting 15 bags on one acre of land. Before joining One Acre Fund, Emily was only able to harvest seven bags of maize on one acre of land. \r\n\r\nWith this loan, One Acre Fund will purchase fertilizer, seeds, and other important inputs to distribute to Emily and her group during Kenya\u2019s next planting season in February 2012. The distribution of farming inputs is part of One Acre Fund\u2019s integrated agriculture package, which includes training, reliable input supply (such as fertilizer and seeds), credit and insurance. \r\n\r\nWith income from her maize sales, Emily will educate her children, ensure food security and invest in livestock rearing. In 2012, the members of Nandika group will each plant between \u00bd and 1 acre of maize.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":932111,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To source farming inputs, such as seeds and fertilizer, at low prices for the 2012 planting season.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Webuye","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.616667 34.766667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2011-11-30T08:20:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Emily","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jackson","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jael","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Martha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":37100,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37100}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":425}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":425,"local_amount":37100,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-27T10:17:27Z","rounded_local_amount":38377.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315681138}],"funded_date":"2011-12-21T01:17:09Z","paid_date":"2012-11-27T10:17:27Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":368563,"name":"Magdalena","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Magdalena  lives in Kampala, Uganda.

She owns a general store in the local village. Her husband, Mr. Sim Sor, is a farmer who owns 1.5-hectares of land where he cultivates rice to support his family. They have some problems with the rice field because they did not have enough money to buy rice seed. Also, the soil is infertile, it is far from the irrigation system and there are a lot of insects.

More particularly, there was the revolution that happened on the 7th of April and interethnic conflict in the southern part of the Kyrgyz Republic. These events changed the situation in the Kyrgyz Republic in all of its aspects: social, economic, political, etc. While the government is working towards stabilizing the situation, ordinary people are trying to return to their normal way of life. So are Shairkul D., the leader of this group, and all the members of her group.\r\n\r\nShairkul is married and has four children. She works as a cook in the hospital and earns 1,400 soms monthly. She and her husband are representative of traditional Kyrgyz families: they live together with her husband\u2019s parents and breed cattle. They are almost fifteen years into their cattle breeding business. They started their business with an initial investment of 15,000 soms and it now brings 11,500 soms monthly. Now, they have bought a car for her husband and he is working as a taxi driver with an income of 10,000 soms.\r\n\r\nShairkul and her husband realize the crucial role of education and want to give to their elder daughter an opportunity to study at an institution of higher education. Thus, they are asking for a loan of which the most part will go for the payment of the tuition fee for their daughter\u2019s education and the another part will go to the purchase of hay for their cattle in order to continue their cattle breeding business.\r\n\r\nThe other group members:\r\n\r\nKului S. is the treasurer of the group. She is 49 and married with two sons: her elder son lives independently; her second son is 16 and is going to graduate from school this year. Kului works as a cook in the hospital and receives 1,800 soms monthly. Her husband is mainly involved in their family cattle-breeding business but also makes some money as a builder. They started their family cattle breeding business nine years ago with an initial investment of 5,000 soms. Now, they have significantly increased their livestock population and their business brings them 7,800 soms monthly. Together they have built a house for their elder son and he lives there with his wife. Now, their daughter is planning to get married. With the loan, Kului is planning to buy a dowry for her daughter.\r\n\r\nAzamat S. is 27 years old and is single. He works as a masseur in the hospital and receives 2,000 soms monthly. He bought an area of 0.7 hectares (1.75 acres) under crops. He started his business seven years ago with an initial investment of 10,000 soms and it now brings 5,100 soms monthly. Azamat wants to have a beloved wife and many children. Still, before getting married, he wants to build a house where he will live his happy married life with his family. He is asking for a loan which will help him to buy construction materials to build a house and his future.\r\n\r\nNurzat A. is 40 and married. She is a nurse at the central hospital and receives 3,200 soms monthly. She has two daughters: her elder daughter is 16 and is going to graduate this year and her youngest daughter is 13 and goes to school. Nurzat\u2019s husband is a farmer and their family business gives them 11,000 soms monthly. As with other mothers, she wants to give the best to her daughters. Thus, she is applying for a loan in order to pay the tuition fee of the institution of higher education so that her daughter has an opportunity to study and become a qualified specialist in the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---<\/b>\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance, a young and ambitious socially-focused MFI in Kyrgyzstan.\r\n\r\nMol Bulak Finance is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development on the basis of the 3-Ps concept - People (building human capital and taking care of its customers and the society as well), Profit (to be profitable in order to grow further) and the Planet (taking care of the environment).

M..  The group's name was chosen in honor of the street where the group's members live in the settlement of San Juan Jicayan which is located 45 minutes north of Pinotepa Nacional, Oaxaca.\r\nThe women's settlement is entirely maD. up of Mixtec indigenous people.  Most of the inhabitants work in crafts and in farming.  Amongst the hand-crafted items which they produce are 'j\u00edcaras' (traditional drinking bowls maD. from calabashes or gourds), textiles such as 'naguas' (skirts) and 'huipiles' (blouses or tunics).  These 'naguas' and 'huipiles' form part of their traditional dress.\r\n\r\nThe magic of this settlement lies in its traditions and customs but unfortunately its people have suffered great changes.  This is the case, for example, of the patenting of 'huipil' making.  They were displaced by foreign machines and have been robbed of the legacy of their symbology.  In this settlement, poverty prevails and they have been neglected by the authorities.  This means that its  inhabitants have emigrated to the United States and other places away from their communities.  Ignorance and a lack of education are ingredients which combine with the inequality which is found in the majority of the indigenous settlements in this region.  At the end of this story we will see the name of each one of the members of this group and the business activities which they pursue to make money.\r\n\r\nOn this occasion, let us make a space so that we can talk a little about the life of one of the members of this group.  Mrs Julia Dionicio Hern\u00e1ndez is 32 years old.  She is married to 36 year-old F\u00e9lix who has spent all his life working in the fields.  Julia has been married for 15 years and has 5 children who are currently studying.  Her children are: 15 year-old Miguel who is in the third year of high school, 13 year-old Adelina who is in her first year of high school, 10 year-old Florentino, 8 year-old Juana and 7 year-old F\u00e9lix who are in their fifth, third and second years of elementary school.  They all speak Mixtec and their mother speaks only very little Spanish.\r\n\r\nSince she was 10 years old, Julia has been making traditional garments which are now known as  handicrafts such as: 'naguas' (traditional skirts), backstrap loom weavings, 'huipiles' (traditional blouses or tunics), napkins and also hand-maD. threads.  This has been part of a legacy which has been passed down from generation to generation and which also provides money to support the family.  As we have already mentioned, Julia has spent her whole life making handmaD. textiles called 'backstrap loom weaving' but what is backstrap loom weaving and what do you make with it?\r\n\r\nLet us talk a little more about backstrap loom weaving which is known as 'saahma tavi'.  This technique dates back to ancient times.  We can point out that it is from pre-hispanic times and has great value and its own style.  Rustic materials maD. from unique wood are used along with a unique finish.  Items of clothing are maD. such as 'naguas' (traditional skirts which are called 'chee' in Mixtec), 'huipiles' to cover the back and there are also backstrap loom weaving techniques for the making of 'huipiles' in the form of a dress which are called 'shicu lestu'.  In the making of these clothes, the dyes also have ancient origins since they are use dyes obtained from a sea shell known as 'caracol p\u00farpura' (literally, 'purple shell') from which colors such as 'guinda' (a cherry color), 'morado' (a mulberry color) and purple are obtained.  They also use indigo, cochineal and '\u00e1rbol D. caracol' (another kind of shell-based dye).  In fact, these clothes just can't be compared to clothes created on an industrial machine.\r\n\r\nJulia joined a loan group because she needed a loan to acquire the necessary material to make her crafts.  With this money she will be able to buy the following material: cotton threads for making 'huipiles', rustic threads for creating backstrap loom weavings, shell-dyed threads for making 'naguas', different colored threads for making napkins and tablecloths, embroidery threads and different colored worsted yarns and ribbons.\r\n\r\nOne of Julia's most longed-for dreams is to set up an organization of craftswomen where she can preserve and teach the valuable techniques of this art as well as promote these items of clothes which have been displaced by modernist fashion trends.  She would also like for women of few means to be able to learn this traD. so that they can improve their lives and those of their families, to show that indigenous women can shine and no longer need to be in a corner, abandoned and lagging behind.  She also wants to see her children be successful.  She wants them to have a better life, far from poverty and need, and for them not to have to emigrate.  She wants them to be good and hard-working people.\r\n\r\nAll the people who make up this group are hard-working women.  They are all indigenous women, full of vitality and an infinite hope, who believe in their dreams and believe in the goodness of other people.\r\n\r\nJulia is totally grateful for this noble gesture of help which the people who are supporting Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad are offering.  Those around the world who are putting in their grain of sand through Kiva to improve the lives of the most vulnerable.  In the name of her fellow group members, she sends you a big hug.\r\n\r\nBelow we give you the names of those who make up the \u201cAbasolo\u201d group and list their business activities:\r\nLucia D.

Efrance, age 60, is a happily married mother of five who has been in dairy farming in Natete-Kampala for the past 20 years. She also has a side business selling firewood and water from which she ekes out additional profits. Before taking root in any of the aforementioned businesses, she was bearing a hand in a charcoal sales business, which she has since dispensed with. In the future, Efrance says she wants to expand her business horizons, and principally she is looking at constructing her own rental structures.

El problema de su trabajo radica en no poder contar a la mano con los pescados que es el ingrediente fundamental para preparar los platos; es por ello que tiene que realizar viajes a la ciudad de Lima e Iquitos donde encuentra pescados de la mejor calidad. Con el dinero solicitado es para la compra de pescados y mariscos. Pero ahora lo que m\u00e1s prioriza es comprar su propio lote de terreno y as\u00ed obviar el contrato del arrendamientos de locales. Este es su primer cr\u00e9dito de manera individual con MFP, pero a la vez es socio en los bancos comunales donde es muy puntual con sus cronogramas de pago. Con los 3,000 nuevos soles solicitados, comprar\u00e1  pescados y mariscos de las ciudades de Lima e Iquitos.\n\n","en":"Cesar, 27, is a Kimbiri native.  He is single and lives with his parents.  He's an optimistic young man with a strong drive to get ahead in the world.  Cesar began his culinary adventures working as a street vendor, selling on the streets of the Peruvian towns of Kimbiri and San Francisco.  He has a flair for cooking local dishes such as ceviche and when he had enough saved to start a business, he rented space in a building and opened his own restaurant.  He tells us that, on the first day, he sold all the food he had in just a couple of hours.  He has a bigger space now and 2 kitchen assistants.  Cesar likes the work and his customers.  His restaurant is a friendly place where his customers look over pictures of local tourist sites while they wait.  His main problem is that there are no ready supplies of seafood, the basic ingredient of his menu.  He has to go to the cities of Lima and Iquitos where he can get supplies of good-quality products.  Cesar will use this loan to buy fish and other seafood.  His immediate priority, though, is to buy a space for the restaurant, a space that he would own rather than lease.  This is Cesar's first MFP loan, but he's a member of a community bank and has a history of repaying other loans.  He will use this 3,000 new soles loan to buy fish and other seafood in the the cities of Lima and Iquitos."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":741814,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Restaurant","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy supplies of seafood for restaurant business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"CUSCO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.518333 -71.978056","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-03-29T20:30:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1075,"lender_count":36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Cesar ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-03-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":203.42},{"due_date":"2011-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":210.78},{"due_date":"2011-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":221.48},{"due_date":"2011-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":229.23},{"due_date":"2011-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":234.72},{"due_date":"2011-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":243.21},{"due_date":"2011-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":253.98},{"due_date":"2011-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":261.2},{"due_date":"2011-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":272.01},{"due_date":"2012-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":279.46},{"due_date":"2012-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":291.31},{"due_date":"2012-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":299.2}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.89},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.53},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.37},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.14},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.1},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.15},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.01},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":93.6},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":97.47},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100.14},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.39},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":107.21}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":72.89,"local_amount":203.42,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:31:34Z","rounded_local_amount":204.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206196440},{"amount":139.59,"local_amount":389.54,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:41:32Z","rounded_local_amount":392.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211270120},{"amount":142.63,"local_amount":398.03,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:32:11Z","rounded_local_amount":401.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216550138},{"amount":156.93,"local_amount":437.94,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T09:13:29Z","rounded_local_amount":441.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221718814},{"amount":154.64,"local_amount":431.54,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-17T08:12:54Z","rounded_local_amount":434.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227350278},{"amount":124.56,"local_amount":347.61,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:47:57Z","rounded_local_amount":350.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232850765},{"amount":283.76,"local_amount":791.92,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:55:39Z","rounded_local_amount":798.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238665944}],"funded_date":"2011-04-09T15:39:46Z","paid_date":"2011-11-15T10:55:39Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jere Wiseman","image":30736}},{"id":290689,"name":"Namatovu","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Namatovu O.

M., Yamileth del Carmen C. G., and \u00c1lvaro de Jes\u00fas C. G. who come from a small area called San Francisco located near the town of Nindiri.\r\n\r\n37-year old Do\u00f1a Jer\u00f3nima is the coordinator of the group. She comes from a humble background and doesn\u2019t know how to read as she was born into a very poor home and was unable to go to school. Consequently, ever since she was a little girl, she learned to survive by working very hard. At a very young age she learned how to make tortillas which kept her going for many years. She did this until her husband encouraged her to start a business selling calculators. He taught her some business skills and how to deal with the money she earned. Jer\u00f3nima has four children, two of whom are still in school. The two older ones lost interest. For this reason she dreams of learning to read, and in spite of her age she is determined to fulfil this dream and thus motivate her older children to better themselves and improve their lives.\r\n\r\nThis group is starting its eleventh loan cycle, and they are very happy to be able to continue since with the money they have been able to expand their businesses.\r\n\r\nDo\u00f1a Rosibel T. sells fruit and vegetables in the streets of Masaya. She has three children who she hopes will do well in life.

She is 37; married; and has 5 children who are 17, 11, 8, 4, and 1.  The oldest ones go to school.  She studied through 6th grade and had to stop going to school due to her parents' lack of financial resources.  This year she returned to school and is going to the 7th grade.  She lives in her own home with her family.  She also supports her nieces and\/or nephews who live with her.  After she got married, she left Manjacaze for Maputo in 1998 with her husband, who works at the National Road Directive as an inspector.  She is a merchant and has owned her own business for more than 3 years.  She doesn't have employees and only has the help of two of her children.  From this business, she receives a daily profit of 500 meticais.  With the help of the salary of her husband, which is 10,698 meticais a month, she manages to save some in the Barclays bank.  She hasn't had a loan at other banks.  She became familiar with Hluvuku through her friend, Maria Ndlate, who is also a client of the institution.  This is her third loan, and it is for 15,000 meticais.  She will use it to purchase construction materials (metal sheets and bars) to continue putting a roof on her home.  Her previous loans were for 9,000 and 10,000 meticais, which were both used for the same purpose.  After she puts a roof on her home, she hopes to request more loans to finish her house and to furnish it.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Tanya Harper, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":430543,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":null,"use":"Purchase of construction material (cement, sand, etc.)","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MZ","country":"Mozambique","town":"Boane, Maputo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-26.041667 32.325278","type":"point"}},"partner_id":23,"posted_date":"2009-11-24T00:20:15Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":525,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.48,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hortencia Fabiao","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-11-10T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MZN","disbursal_amount":15000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":18,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":681.29},{"due_date":"2010-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":709.29},{"due_date":"2010-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":738.44},{"due_date":"2010-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":768.79},{"due_date":"2010-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":800.38},{"due_date":"2010-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":833.27},{"due_date":"2010-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":867.52},{"due_date":"2010-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":903.17},{"due_date":"2010-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":940.28},{"due_date":"2010-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":978.93},{"due_date":"2010-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1019.16},{"due_date":"2010-11-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1061.04},{"due_date":"2010-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":1104.64},{"due_date":"2011-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":1150.04},{"due_date":"2011-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":1197.3},{"due_date":"2011-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":1246.46}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.85},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":24.82},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.85},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.9},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.02},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.16},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.36},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.62},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.91},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.26},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.67},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.13},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.67},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.25},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.9},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.63}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":71.68,"local_amount":2047.95,"processed_date":"2009-12-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T14:23:56Z","rounded_local_amount":2089.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110709068},{"amount":147.43,"local_amount":4212.21,"processed_date":"2010-02-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-17T07:37:08Z","rounded_local_amount":4297.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123938183},{"amount":72.41,"local_amount":2068.84,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-31T11:19:08Z","rounded_local_amount":2110.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123938184},{"amount":75.83,"local_amount":2180.32,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:14:42Z","rounded_local_amount":2224.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.48,"payment_id":128972054},{"amount":81.9,"local_amount":2340.06,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:14:10Z","rounded_local_amount":2387.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136698636},{"amount":75.27,"local_amount":2150.62,"processed_date":"2010-06-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-14T08:53:23Z","rounded_local_amount":2194.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151916082}],"funded_date":"2009-11-24T05:49:22Z","paid_date":"2010-09-14T08:53:23Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tanya Harper","image":783083}},{"id":158940,"name":"Ifeoma","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ifeoma is a fashion designer and she also sells tailoring materials to make a living.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

He uses this money for household expenses and also saves some in his bank account.\r\n\r\nHe has had loans from other banks. Jo\u00e3o learned about Hluvuku through coworkers who are customers of this institution. This is Jo\u00e3o's fourth loan with Hluvuku. He is asking for 20,000 meticais to buy construction materials (iron, cement, sand and other items) to continue work on his house. The earlier loans for 8,000.00 meticais,12,000.00 meticais and 15,000.00 meticais were for housing.  \r\n\r\nJo\u00e3o's dream is to finish his house. In order to do this, he promises to make his payments on time so he can take out more loans in the future. He does intend to ask for more loans.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":779252,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal

She is Togolese (Togo is a border country of Benin). Apauline is married and the mother of 3 children, all in school. Only two of the children are still her responsibility.  Apauline lives in the Gb\u00e9gamey neighborhood and she does her selling in the market of that district. <P>\r\n\r\nFor 10 years, Apauline has been selling cereals and condiments for sauces. Apauline goes to the little local markets in Benin to buy the cereals that she re-sells at the market of  Gb\u00e9gamey. As for condiments for sauces, Apauline buys her supplies in the international market of Benin. She has already had two loans through ALID\u00e9. These two loans have permitted her to expand her business. However, Apauline wants to continue to develop her business; that is why she is requesting a third loan from ALID\u00e9 to reinforce her working capital so as to better satisfy her clientele. \r\n\r\n \r\nThe significance of ALID\u00e9 in the local language of B\u00e9nin, Fon, is \"there is always a pathway for the poorest of the poor.

Jr. The couple were blessed with four children. Their youngest child is still studying in high school,  but the eldest only finished elementary school while the second and third attended some high school. Letecia considered this a failure for herself but according to her she had no options then. She and her husband were just laborers and had a very small income. They didn't even have capital to start up a business. \r\n\r\nIn 2007, Letecia heard about ASHI. Her dream of having a stable life with stable house and stable future of her children was rekindled, despite her chidlren's educational attainment. When she received her first and succeeding loans from ASHI, shestarted her own business of buying and selling vegetables. It has been two years that she has had this kind of business. Buying and selling vegetables has been a great help to Letecia and her family.  However, the demand of her family grows as years goes by, so  she aspires to have more business that can add  to her present income so she will have bigger profits and savings. \r\n\r\nLetecia thought of raising pigs (hog-fattening) in her backyard to be sold after four months. With this kind of business, she can still manage her previous business, because either her children or husband can feed the pigs at home when she's away selling her vegetables. Letecia's loan is intended for this. Someday, as her income increases, she wants her hog fattening business to grow. She plans to sell her pigs during market day in the town's public market."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":352494,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"purchases

He is 27 years old, married and the father of a 4-year old. He only went to school until the 5th grade due to his parents lack of financial resources. He owns the house where he lives with his family and 4 siblings he also supports.\r\n<p>\r\nHe has lived in Boane since his childhood and has never lived anywhere else. He has had his own business for over 10 years and has no employees. He learned the businees from his parents and works around 10 hours a day. He sells mostly beer, sodas and wine. He makes around 2.000.00mt a week which goes towards house expenses and his savings account. \r\n<p>\r\nHe has never had loans from other banks. He came to know about Hluvuku through his neighbor who is also a member. This loan, in the amount of 10.000.00mt, is his second. He intends to purchase supplies (beer, sodas, wine and others) to increase and diversify his inventory. The previous loan was for 7.000.00mt used for the same purpose. \r\n<p>\r\nIn the future, he would like to request more loans to buy a car to make transporting his inventory easier and to invest in his business.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Betyna Almeida-Covarrubias, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":450926,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Purchase of inventory (beer, sodas and others)","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MZ","country":"Mozambique","town":"Boane, Maputo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-26.041667 32.325278","type":"point"}},"partner_id":23,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sergio Vasco","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-11-23T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MZN","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":18,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":439.43},{"due_date":"2010-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":459.29},{"due_date":"2010-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":480.05},{"due_date":"2010-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":501.75},{"due_date":"2010-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":524.44},{"due_date":"2010-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":548.14},{"due_date":"2010-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":572.92},{"due_date":"2010-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":598.82},{"due_date":"2010-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":625.89},{"due_date":"2010-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":654.18},{"due_date":"2010-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":683.76},{"due_date":"2010-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":714.67},{"due_date":"2010-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":746.97},{"due_date":"2011-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":780.74},{"due_date":"2011-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":816.03},{"due_date":"2011-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":852.92}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15.38},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.08},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.8},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.56},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.35},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.19},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.05},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.96},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.91},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.89},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.93},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25.02},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.14},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.33},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.56},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.85}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Betyna Almeida-Covarrubias","image":null}},{"id":167216,"name":"Crisanta","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Crisanta S.

Later, she started selling cosmetics and apparel as a street vendor in Managua. With the profits she earned, she started making nacatamales (Central American tamales), vigoron (traditional Nicaraguan fast food), and vaho (a mix of meat, green plantains and yuca cooked in banana leaves) on weekends. She then opted to take out a loan and invested it in purchasing more apparel, footwear, and cosmetics to sell them from home. With those profits, she started making breakfast and lunch for the people who work in the Free Trade Zone. On weekends, she sells nacatamales. <p>\r\nWith this loan, she will purchase more beauty products, as well as clothing for men, women and children so that she can keep increasing her inventory and profits because she depends on this money to be able to feed her young children. <p>\r\nShe plans on making household repairs because she needs to have the walls plastered, lay down tile for added hygiene, and replace the doors of her small house.

She lives in Cadiz, Negros Occidental. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2007 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 3,000. Mercedita is borrowing PHP 20,000 to fund operations. This will be her sixth loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 15,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Mercedita aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future wellbeing by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She registered herself as a dealer of JTY Products, a direct selling company with main products of ready-to-wear clothes, home decor items, and home accessories.

En la actualidad los hijos la apoyan, este es precisamente uno de sus logros: el  haberlos sacado adelante, porque han realizado carreras t\u00e9cnicas y ahora son su gran soporte.\nPara Aid\u00e9 tener un negocio  ha sido su mejor empleo, este es su segundo cr\u00e9ditos con la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, organizaci\u00f3n que la acogi\u00f3, cuando en otras hab\u00eda sido rechazada porque su edad no se ajustaba a los par\u00e1metros establecidos por esas empresas;   su negocio ha progresado pero sue\u00f1a con ser exitosa en la venta de mercanc\u00edas, actividad que conoce por su propia experiencia.\n\n","en":"Aid\u00e9e J.

One can hear the music containing rhythms of \u201c<a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Champeta\" target=\"_blank\" >champeta<\/a>\u201d that resonate from wooden boxes called \u201cpickup\u201d throughout the area.  Children and adults can\u2019t help but move to the sound of the music.\r\n<p>\r\nAid\u00e9e lives with her husband and has nine children between the ages of 25 and 39.  She sells lunches and occasionally merchandise.  She wants to gradually transition into her second business and is trying to make changes gradually away from selling lunches, but this process has been a great challenge.  For this reason, she is applying for a loan worth 1,000,000 COP to purchase bed sheets, towels, children\u2019s clothing, and shoes.\r\n<p>\r\nAid\u00e9e started her business with the help of a friend who has experience in buying merchandise from the Department of Guajira.  These products were well-received by her customers, but later Aid\u00e9e started traveling on her own to acquire appliances, clothing, and towels with good results.  She still remembers moving to Barranquilla at the age of 9 from Arenal, in the Department of Bolivar.  Aid\u00e9e was not able to finish high school due to several difficulties, so she decided to sell merchandise and eventually lunches to people in her neighborhood and from the surrounding areas.  Her children currently help her since they represent one of her successes.  She helped them get ahead since they were able to earn technical degrees and are now a great support.\r\n<p>\r\nFor Aid\u00e9e, having a business is the best form of employment.  This is her second loan with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, an organization that welcomed her when others rejected her because her age was not consistent with the parameters they established for these types of enterprises.  She has made progress in her business, but she still dreams of being successful in her merchandise sales because she knows she has the experience.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan

He is separated and lives in his own home together with his daughter, his son-in-law and his two grandchildren.  Leopoldo has been selling decals for car and motorcycle taxi windshields for 16 years.  His sales location is in a busy central avenue in the city, one hour by car from his home.  He really enjoys his work since his creativity and his good eye for detail have enabled him to attract many customers which means his business is profitable and he hasn't needed to make much investment.  However, the number of people in the same trade who offer their products more cheaply has increased.  For this reason, Leopoldo needs to buy some decals, crystals and mirrors wholesale so that he can compete effectively against them.  Leopoldo does have some loyal customers who always prefer to buy from him which gives him the motivation he needs to continue working in this business.  In the future, he plans to set up a restaurant.  He plans to rent premises outside his house and the market and go into business with his daughter.\r\n\r\nThis is Leopoldo's 16th loan with MFP and he pledges to continue making his loan repayments with the same responsibility.

Her husband is a bricklayer who works at times on contract and at other times as an independent.  It is tiring work, but pays well.  Yaritza wakes up early in order to make her husband breakfast and lunch as restaurant food is very expensive.  She owns a grocery store, which she opened seven years ago with monies from a settlement from her previous work as a labourer, as well as with her husband's help.  She will use this loan to increase her inventory with a variety of products, such as staples, candies, and cleaning products to offer to her clients.  She has used previous loans to increase her business.  She is thankful for the trust and help AFODENIC have given her as this is her tenth loan.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is a charming lady who rents her home and lives with her three sons, Alberto, age 25; Ricardo, age 24; and Luis, age 22, who help her very much in her work.  She runs a business renting out tents, tables and chairs for social events.  She is well sought out by customers, as her items are well cared for and her prices are reasonable.  She chose this business because it allows her flexibility and she does not have a \"boss\" to pressure her.   It also allows her to spend time with her sons and stay up late studying.  She has run this business for three years and considers the most difficult part to be carrying the heavy tents to the renters' places.  In the future she will save up the money needed to open store selling groceries.\r\n\r\nThis will be Baliba's fourth loan through MFP (Kiva Field Partner).  As with her previous loans, she plans to make her payments on time, because she knows that not doing so will cause problems for her community bank, with whom she has earned a good reputation for being responsible.  With this loan of \"500 Soles\" ($175 US), she will invest in new tables and chairs, which she expects to be able to rent out for slightly higher prices.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Hugo Reyes, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":391405,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"Purchase of tables and charis to rent out","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Juliaca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15.5 -70.133333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-09-20T05:00:17Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":175,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Balbina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-09-04T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2009-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2009-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2010-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2010-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":85}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.05},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.05},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.05},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.05},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.05},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":29.05,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2009-10-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:00:28Z","rounded_local_amount":84.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96997550},{"amount":29.05,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2009-11-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:53:05Z","rounded_local_amount":84.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103842899},{"amount":87.15,"local_amount":249,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T15:24:58Z","rounded_local_amount":252.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734474},{"amount":29.75,"local_amount":85,"processed_date":"2010-03-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:32:28Z","rounded_local_amount":86.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128992428}],"funded_date":"2009-09-20T06:23:58Z","paid_date":"2010-04-15T09:32:28Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Hugo E.

They organized themselves by means of a \"mesa directiva\", choosing a president, treasurer and secretary from among those who started the group.  \r\n\r\nThe president, Sra. CRISTINA, lives in El Alto and sells food in the Ballivian neighborhood.  She is ambitious for her business.  She only has a single stand now, but she wants to expand it and lease space so that she can increase her income and improve the lives of her family.  She will use money from the loan to buy tables and chairs for her food stand.  \r\n\r\nThe treasurer, Sra. ALICIA sells honey.  She buys her product from producers in various parts of Bolivia and sells it, generally, at markets in La Paz.  She has two daughters, 12 and 9, and her greatest hope is to see them land professional careers.  She is a courageous woman who strives hard to make sure nothing will hold her back.  \r\n\r\nThe secretary, Sra. GUADALUPE, lives in an \"anticretico\" (a lease-purchase arrangement common in Bolivia) in the Ballivian neighborhood.  She makes natural medicines, patches, pomades, etc., all maD. from plants.  She has two children and her husband helps her with the business.  Her greatest wish is to build a covered structure for the business.  She needs the loan to travel to Desaguadero on the Bolivian border with Peru where she buys the product that she sells.\r\n
