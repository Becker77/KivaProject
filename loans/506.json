She is always looking for ways to improve her family\u2019s finances.  In 2001 she joined the Fund for the first time.  With a small loan, she invested in raising livestock; in subsequent rounds she always successfully put the loan to good use and brought in a high income.  From then, her family was able to save up an amount of money.  Even though the money saved up was not very much, it was enough for the family to invest in opening a store specializing in selling rice.  This item is one item that people truly cannot live without.  Starting with the small store, the family has been able to expand the business to a larger operation.  Since shifting focus to this venture, she has seen the family\u2019s finances improve faster; both her children are able to go to school.  In this round of funding the family is requesting 15,000,000 VND.  Their average income is 5,000,000 VND per month.  \r\n<p><b>Translated from Vietnamese by Chi Nguyen, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\nCh\u1ecb \u0110\u00e0o Th\u1ecb H\u1eadu 38 tu\u1ed5i m\u1eb7c d\u00f9 tu\u1ed5i \u0111\u1eddi c\u00f2n tr\u1ebb nh\u01b0ng l\u00e0 ng\u01b0\u1eddi ph\u1ee5 n\u1eef n\u0103ng \u0111\u1ed9ng, nhanh nh\u1eb9n n\u00ean ch\u1ecb lu\u00f4n t\u00ecm m\u1ecdi c\u00e1ch l\u00e0m \u0103n \u0111\u1ec3 n\u00e2ng cao kinh t\u1ebf gia \u0111\u00ecnh.

Abdunosir is a farmer dedicated, for more than 17 years, to the production of potatoes and raising cattle. He is married and has four children. His wife is a housekeeper and the business of Abdunosir is the sole source of income for his family.\r\n\r\nHis potato harvest is about to come and that is why he is requesting a loan of 5,000 Somoni to acquire agricultural products and apply them to his harvest. With part of the loan he will also buy young cattle for raising and selling.\r\n\r\nAbdunosir wishes to improve his living conditions and hopes to do so from the income that his business will bring.   \r\n\r\n\r\n<b>More about Tajikistan and IMON International<\/b>\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

He has a motorcycle and motor vehicle repair shop in a rented space located in a very busy area.  He is partnered with his brother, who is also a mechanic.  Francisco's specific task, however, is running the lathe (he is in charge of boring, connecting rods, and everything else that has to do with the interior parts of the engine), and welding.  He has been doing this for the past 4 years and his work day goes from 6am until 6pm.  Francisco makes an effort to show his customers that he does high quality work and his profits are good because there isn't a motorcycle or a motor vehicle in his area that fails to come to his shop.  In the future, he would like to own his own lathe workshop.  This is his second credit with MFP.  He likes working with his communal bank because they know how to solve problems quickly and they are very well organized and responsible.

For 15 years he has worked independently, and he has his own music band, where he has performed in social gatherings such as graduation parties, weddings, baptisms, birthdays, and all types of events. He has a lot of experience in the music business. He is the representative member of his band, and he also plays the electric drums. This is why he enjoys his work, in the company of the other members of the band. This business of music performances is profitable to Saul since there is great demand for his work and frequently there are events that are done in his city.

Camana has historically been an important tourist destination in Peru, nevertheless, the frequent and  strong earthquakes and tsunamis of the last decade (an 8.4 in 2001 and 8.0 in 2007) decimated the city, destroyed the tourist industry in Camana costing many their jobs, livelihoods and homes. But the result of the unemployment has created an atmosphere prepared for microfinancing. Camana has precious beaches and, in his free time, Walter enjoys fishing to relax a little. In addition, he knows that Peru is known for having the most delicious food in the world and one of the dishes that Walter likes is \"Pure de Papas\" (mashed potatoes). Walter studied up to the fifth year of high school but he would have liked to study journalism. Walter lives with his partner. His spouse is dedicated to selling cakes and sweets on foot. Together they have one child who currently is in his fifth year of high school.\r\n\r\nWalter is dedicated to photography service. He does this work eight hours a day. In one day, Walter can attend to approximately 15 customers and this allows him to earn approximately S. 35 daily and, on a good day, he can earn up to S. 70, which helps with some of the additional home bills as well as support his spouse selling her products. He believes that his business is going well because he is very friendly with customers and because he completes his work on time.\r\n\r\nCurrently, he is very thankful for the Kiva loans since with this support he can purchase materials and printers for his business. This improvement will help him to have a more modern printer and be able to complete more printing jobs than today and in a few months expand his shop which will help him earn more income and fulfill his great dream: to purchase land to build a house."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":966033,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Photography","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to purchase materials and printers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Caman\u00e1","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":139,"posted_date":"2011-12-31T08:30:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":750,"lender_count":26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Walter Augusto","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-12-09T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":135.02},{"due_date":"2012-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":139.94},{"due_date":"2012-03-09T08:00:00Z","amount":149.21},{"due_date":"2012-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":150.52},{"due_date":"2012-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":157.75},{"due_date":"2012-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":161.82},{"due_date":"2012-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":169.07},{"due_date":"2012-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":173.93},{"due_date":"2012-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":180.3},{"due_date":"2012-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":187.6},{"due_date":"2012-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":193.77},{"due_date":"2012-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":201.07}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.63},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.48},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.95},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.45},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.16},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.68},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.4},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.22},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.62},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.35},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.66},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75.4}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":50.63,"local_amount":135.02,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T09:45:49Z","rounded_local_amount":136.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257142556},{"amount":52.48,"local_amount":139.94,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T08:58:04Z","rounded_local_amount":141.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263271147},{"amount":55.95,"local_amount":149.21,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T08:58:58Z","rounded_local_amount":150.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276601702},{"amount":442.88,"local_amount":1180.99,"processed_date":"2012-10-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T12:12:08Z","rounded_local_amount":1193.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315344593},{"amount":72.66,"local_amount":193.77,"processed_date":"2012-11-09T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T12:37:33Z","rounded_local_amount":195.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322953832},{"amount":75.4,"local_amount":201.07,"processed_date":"2012-12-09T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T12:23:11Z","rounded_local_amount":203.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331088269}],"funded_date":"2012-01-16T19:27:51Z","paid_date":"2013-01-15T12:23:11Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":380548,"name":"Lien","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lien, 50, is married and has two children: one son and one daughter.

Thi Nguyen and her husband, Thang Van Nguyen, joined the Fund with the goal of borrowing money to expand their business.  In the first year, since they were not yet experienced with the repayment method of weekly payments, they opted to borrow 700,000 VND to buy two breeding pigs.  During the day her husband works to have money for the weekly payment and in a short time the first loan was repaid and at the same time the couple had saved a small amount of money from selling pigs.  Seeing that borrowing loans and repaying on a weekly basis fit well with the needs of the family, in subsequent funding rounds the family boldly borrowed larger amounts to expand the livestock operations.  Under the more favorable conditions of the business operations, the family\u2019s finances have improved day by day, they have been able to afford more everyday conveniences.  The couple has two children, one grown and one still in school.  In this round of funding the family is requesting 9,000,000 VND to continue investing in raising pigs.  Their average revenue from the livestock and other jobs is 3,500,000 VND per month.\r\nTranslated from Vietnamese by Chi Nguyen, Kiva volunteer.\r\nKh\u00f4ng ch\u1ecbu ch\u1ea5p nh\u1eadn s\u1ef1 ngh\u00e8o t\u00fang m\u00e3i.

Salamague, Lamut, Ifugao. She is 30 years old. Deona Ann is the group leader of an eight-member group loan offered by ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is Deona Ann M.'s Group.\r\n\r\nDeona Ann is married and has two school-aged children. To make a living, Deona Ann owns & operates a business venture in the retail sector running a general store. The main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling a variety of different products in the local community. Deona Ann has been engaged in her business for over five years and earns approximately 4,500 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Deona Ann joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Deona Ann has successfully repaid a previous loan of 12,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Deona Ann is requesting a new loan of 12,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase new items to expand her product offering. This loan will be the fifth loan taken out by Deona Ann from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Shilcayo, San Mart\u00edn Province, San Mart\u00edn.  She is 44 years old, and lives with her one child and his father.  Benita tells us she began her business selling groceries, and has devoted herself to this business for years.  She established her business, saving little by little, and with a loan of S\/. 300.00 began to purchase the products to establish her little shop.  Today Benita's neighbors and friends know her and are well received, and her sales are going well.  This is a great advantage, as generating her own income allows Benita to be responsible with her payments.  With this loan of S\/. 1,500.00, Benita will purchase groceries such as: rice and sugar in bags, packages of milk and cooking oil, packages of soft drinks in different flavors and sizes, cleaning products for the home and personal hygiene products.  This way she will keep her customers satisfied and happy.  Benita feels very satisfied with the work she undertakes, and believes it is worth the sacrifice to achieve the dreams and goals she has established in her life.  She thanks the Manuela Ramos Movement for providing support to her and other women who want to succeed. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Elizabeth Novesky, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":351539,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Purchase groceries to augment her inventory","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"San Mart\u00edn","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":72,"posted_date":"2009-07-14T14:10:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":500,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Benita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-06-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.35}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-07-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:14:46Z","rounded_local_amount":254.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63206179},{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-08-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T18:47:27Z","rounded_local_amount":254.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73635434},{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-09-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T22:45:28Z","rounded_local_amount":254.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87074510},{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-10-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T02:07:32Z","rounded_local_amount":254.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96989849},{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-11-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:41:07Z","rounded_local_amount":254.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103834793},{"amount":83.35,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-12-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T15:07:37Z","rounded_local_amount":254.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110726726}],"funded_date":"2009-07-22T13:49:32Z","paid_date":"2010-01-15T15:07:37Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":125642,"name":"Grace","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Grace is a member of the Upendo North borrower group in Kinyanambo.

Each individual member is involved in a commercial activity such as sewing or various types of sales (shoes, clothing, jewelry, livestock and catalogue items). Each woman will use this loan to make general investments in their productive activity. For example, to purchase chickens, animal feed, or various merchandise for sale. As the Christmas season is upon us, many Costa Ricans will be making gift purchases this month. This represents an opportunity for these women to increase their revenues.  \r\n\r\nMaria Ofelia, the elected president of this group, is a 63-year-old mother of 8 who lives by herself in Paso Canoas. Maria has a sewing business. She produces bedding such as sheets, blankets and pillow covers. She sews during the daytime and at night she prepares the projects she plans to work on for the next day. \r\n\r\nThe community of Paso Canoas is plagued by poverty, partially due to a serious lack of job opportunities. Maria\u2019s goal is to create a better living situation for herself, her fellow group members, as well as strive to provide employment opportunities in the community at large. Her main obstacle has been a lack of access to working capital. This loan will help to address this issue. \r\n\r\nThe members of The Women\u2019s Bank of Dorcas know each other from living in the same community and from meetings at the local church. Maria says the main benefit of receiving a loan from Fundacion Mujer is the low interest rate that will be charged, as compared to other financial institutions. The name of this group is symbolic of a hardworking woman that the members learned of in the bible.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2100,"image":{"id":654356,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":["Underfunded

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Nonetheless, at 27, Sapia still aims to make her business a success as it is the primary means for her to achieve a sustainable living. She attended college and presently resides near the public market in Tanza, Cavite. \r\n\r\nSapia\u2019s business centers on selling retail items such as bags, toys, watches, and other accessories. She sells these among friends, business acquaintances and fellow community members, who do not see it too imprudent to purchase items which might not be considered essential. Sapia locates her business in the community's public market and for four years she has managed to go without any employees. Monthly, she earns an estimated net income of Php 11,680.\r\n\r\nTo help her sustain her business, Sapia decides to ask for help from CCT by applying for a loan for Php 30,000. She wants to use this loan to purchase stocks of school bags and socks, as well as other items such as wallets and watches. Sapia sees the loan as crucial in supporting her working capital and bringing about an increase in her profits. She intends to use the profits to sustain her business and her living.\r\n\r\nThere are many dreams in Sapia\u2019s heart, that is why no matter how big the challenges are, they fail to distract her focus. She dreams of making her business grow and become sustainable, and she is grateful to those people who enable her to achieve it. As a CCT community partner, Sapia faithfully attends the group's weekly fellowship* meeting where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":778792,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

most of the women in her village, Magdalena has many irons in the fire.

She also grows vegetables, and with this loan she will buy a calf to raise for sale. \r\nMagdalena is 40 and has five children, four of school age. Two of them are still in school, but the 13- and 14-year-olds are now working instead of going to school. She herself never went to school and does not read or write. Magdalena's husband left long ago. Magdalena hopes someday to rent another little plot of land to grow more vegetables. Magdalena's village is nestled right against the side of the Santa Maria volcano, part of a complex of volcanoes that regularly rumbles the area and that completely destroyed the village in the early 20th century. It's a place of beautiful green hillsides and lush plots of corn and vegetables, all divided into little sections called cuerdas. The poorer women often rent just one cuerda and try to grow their own corn for the family and sell some vegetables from it. Those who have more sometimes own two or more cuerdas, and sometimes rent even more. It's hard work, and they always refer to their life as a \"battle\" or \"struggle\", but they continue with the battle to feed their families and keep the kids in school.\r\nWritten by Randy Fay and

Her excellent performance in ASHI in terms of repayment and business all throughout her membership made her one of the most outstanding member. Despite the financial struggle she had in all of her life since birth and during marriage especially on raising her 11 children whose age range is from six to 25 years old, she had manage to remain strong and happy. Her loving husband who is a driver has been so supportive to her especially on her desire for requesting bigger amount of loan. As agreed by both of them, Rose Eden is now requesting for a much bigger amount of loan which will be used for buying a new motorcycle intended for a tricycle (motorcycle with sidecar) for hire business to be managed by her husband. This is to replace their old second hand motorcycle which was bought more than five years ago.\n\nTricycle is one of the most common means of transportation people in the municipality take in going to different villages and neighboring municipalities. \n\nThough at some point of her life, Rose Eden is so disappointed because three of her elder children had decided to stop schooling yet she never loses hope that the rest of them aside from her disabled child will be pursuing their education. She hoped that through her continues loaning, she will be able to grow her business to be able to sustain the education of their children and improve their standard of living.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":400893,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Motorcycle

Thanks to the support of her spouse and her own effort, she was able to expand her business, which began with little inventory and in a small space and now has a bigger space and a large clientele.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She has two children and one dependent to take care of.\r\n\r\nGiven the variety of fruits, vegetables and other foods that she sells, Immaculate has managed to attract and hold her own big and reliable share of clients.

He works in diverse fields in the area. Since this activity does not provide him with enough stablility to pay his personal expenses and help his parents, he began additional work raising animals and selling wood.\r\n\r\nJuan buys carob trees recently felled from sellers in the area and cuts them into pieces to offer them to his customers in 30-unit \"armadas\" (bundles of wood). The business selling wood is useful in the area where he lives since the majority of families cook their food with this product. Additionaly, he raises animals in pens to sell them to vendors who visit the area.\r\n\r\nJuan has already had a loan financed by Kiva and, thanks to that money, he acquired more wood with which he was able to expand his business.

She earns her living by operating fishing and fish vending businesses. Her husband Benito, who is 45 years old, works as a fisherman to earn his living and helps in his wife's business activities.  They have four children who are between 15 and 24 years old. Isabelita joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2004 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 15 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Isabelita has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 17,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 10,000, uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 16th loan, she is borrowing PHP 17,000 to buy fishing gear and equipment so that she can continue to save up for education and home repairs. Isabelita is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Kanymkul sells six or seven liters of milk a day; in this way, she earns about 3,000 soms per month. \r\n\r\nKanymkul applied for the loan because she needs additional financial funds to increase the number of livestock.

She is 40 years old, married, and went to school until the 7th grade.  She is the mother of one son who is studying at the Pedagogical University in the Capital.\r\n\r\nLaurentina left Zavala with her parents who were serving in Namaacha, a town on the border of Swaziland, since her father was an official of the local government.  Having arrived in Namaacha she did not have access to schooling due to a lack of documentation for transfers from one school to another so she went without.\r\n\r\nTime passed, and she became pregnant with her first and only child who was rejected by her boyfriend who alleged that the child she hoped to have did not belong to him.  Laurentina became desperate and asked for help from her father who gave her some funds.  She began her own business of selling empanadas on the black market.  With the funds collected she began to prepare food on the Swaziland border where there was a large flux of people.\r\n\r\nToday she is the owner of a food stand.  Every day she purchases 10 chickens at 100 each, 5kg of stomach at 50 per kg, and 5kg of beef at 95 per kg.  Each plate has a price.  For example, the chicken plate is 40MT per plate, and she can make 7 plates per chicken.  The beef and the stomach do not have exact numbers because it depends on the quality of the meat.\r\n\r\nShe sells 1,500MT on the normal days and 2,300MT on the busy days, but she is only able to save 500MT due to the expenses of her son, who is at the university, and her 2 employees.  One of her employees helps her in the stand earning 800MT, and the other helps at home earning 700MT monthly.\r\n\r\nThis is Laurentina's second loan with Hluvuku and her first with Kiva.  This 10,000MT will be used to purchase more products since she is ready to open another food stand in the informal market, Shoprite, to resell staple products.  She is confident that she will be able to pay off the loan before the stipulated time and request another loan in order to furnish her home.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Jared

This place is known for its craftwork in weaving and also for archeological sites like Cauzhin and Tambo de Marivi\u00f1a, which attract national and foreign tourists alike. The community bank consists of a group of businesswomen who have forged a solid friendship while always looking to improve their families and community bank. Rosario C. is an active member of this community bank. She lives in Cumbe, is 54 years old, married and has three children, ages 33, 30 and 20. Her eldest daughter has her own family and lives at home, while the other two migrated abroad in search of better days for themselves and their parents. Her husband is a construction worker, and with everyone's efforts they were able to build their home. Rosario dedicates herself to households chores and also raises animals like chickens, guinea pigs, pigs, sheep and cows, which produce milk that she delivers to neighbors in her community. She raises the animals as much for her family to eat as to sell them. Rosario has 12 years' experience working with loans from Kiva partner Foundacion Espoir, and with them she has purchased her animals little by little. With the new loan she is requesting, she plans to purchase fertilizer and seeds for her animals' pastures.

Her home is located in Para\u00edso de Guayaquil.  She has been married for nine years.  Her husband works as a carpenter and construction worker.  They have a three year-old daughter.\r\n\r\nA year ago a friend invited her to sell Yanbal beauty products.  This allowed her to save up some money, which she invested in clothing, which she sold alongside the Yanbal items.  Adela now works anytime her customers request her products.  She sells perfumes, creams, lotions, clothing, and makeup.  One of her biggest complications is when her customers do not cancel orders in a timely manner and she must then pay for the items herself.\r\n\r\nShe will use the money from this loan to invest in other Yanbal products and clothing in order to be able to offer a wider assortment.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to tmhe 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.
