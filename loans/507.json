He has been characterized as a very spirited and strong person whose successes are directly applied to his family, composed of his wife and 3 children.  Hotamjon raises livestock for sale. It is necessary to point out that this is the only income that supports his family, which really needs it. Today Hotamjon looks for support from IMON International to obtain the necessary loan to purchase cows to raise.  With this loan his beloved family will benefit as much as he will.   \r\n  \r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She has been a member of  Banco Communal Soluci\u00f3n for 8 years.  During this time, she saved enough money to build a second floor in her house.  She also bought appliances and cooking utensils but the most help she received from Banco Comunal was advice on how to educate her children with love and care.   <p>\r\n\r\nIn her business, Mabel sells fruit - an activity she learned from her mother when she was a little girl.  Mabel buys prickly pear cactus, which is a fruit native to the region and sells it wholesale at markets in Lima.  In these same markets, she also buys fruits like papaya, apples, pepino, and others that are in high demand to sell in Ayacuchan markets. <p>\r\n\r\nHowever, Mabel has another business where she sells auto spare parts from her home.  She started this business 10 years ago because her husband was a mechanic.  At the time, she thought about supplying the parts that her husband needed.  This is how Mabel started delivering parts from Lima.  Now, her store has spare parts and auto lubricants.  <p>\r\n\r\nThe loan she needs amounts to 3000 Peruvian sols.  The total will be invested in boxes and barrels of car lubricants like oil from Shell.  Her savings will then be used to build a third floor in her house and for her own savings.   Her dream is to buy a cart to transport her load and to have her children become professionals.\r\n\r\n<P><b> Translated from Spanish by Geraldine Kim, Kiva Translator.  <\/b><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMabel Nelly tiene 38 a\u00f1os de edad y tiene 3 hijos de 22, 20 y 2 a\u00f1os.

Usaha yang sudah digelutinya puluhan tahun ini memang dulu hanya dengan modal pas-pasan. Tetapi sekarang melihat permintaan akan batu bata yang meningkat karena ramainya pembangunan di daerah sekitarnya maka Nyoman Suanda berniat meningkatkan kapasitas hasil batu bata yang diproduksinya. DINARI merespon kebutuhan modal Nyoman Suanda setelah melihat permohonan yang masuk ke DINARI dimana rencananya pinjaman sebesar Rp.4.000.000,- dengan jangka waktu 12 bulan dan pembayaran cicilan setiap bulan ini akan digunakan Nyoman Suanda untuk menambah modal baik untuk membeli bahan baku batu bata maupun untuk membayar karyawannya sebanyak 2 orang. Keuntungan yang diperoleh perbulannya mencapai Rp.2.000.000,- dimana harga dari batu bata per buahnya adalah Rp.400,- dan Nyoman Suanda mampu menjual batu bata sebanyak 5000 buah setiap bulannya. Dari usahanya ini, Nyoman Suanda mampu menghidupi istrinya yang hanya sebagai ibu rumah tangga serta mampu juga menyekolahkan ketiga anaknya di bangku SD.\n\n\n","en":"An economic condition that corners people to the toughest direction forces people to work even harder. I Nyoman Suanda, who produces red bricks for construction, is one of them. He started his business tens of years ago with limited capital.

DINARI responded to Nyoman Suanda\u2019s capital need after reviewing the proposal. The proposal stated that the 4,000,000 IDR loan, paid in 12 monthly payments, will be used to purchase raw materials and to pay his two employees. His sales in each month is 2,000,000 IDR in which he can sell 5,000 bricks at the price of  400 IDR each. From this business Nyoman Suanda can support his wife and send his three children to elementary school. \r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Indonesian by Arliadi (Ludi) Mahadi, Kiva

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She believes the pasture she gives to her cow provides great-tasting dairy products that are more nutritious and flavourful than those processed and sold at shops. She will also be able to produce more milk and increase her sales volume. \r\n\r\nShe is going to use the extra income to pay for the rising family expenses and also to grow her asset base in order to lead a financially secure life in the future.  \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1666221,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to purchase a dairy cow.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Eldoret","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.516667 35.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":800,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mercy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-08-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":68275,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":16,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":3136.07},{"due_date":"2014-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":3873.23},{"due_date":"2014-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":4030.82},{"due_date":"2014-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":4086.17},{"due_date":"2014-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":4242.44},{"due_date":"2015-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":4310.54},{"due_date":"2015-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":4426.67},{"due_date":"2015-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":4650.65},{"due_date":"2015-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":4671.21},{"due_date":"2015-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":4823.87},{"due_date":"2015-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":4927.05},{"due_date":"2015-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":5078.08},{"due_date":"2015-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":5196.56},{"due_date":"2015-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":5336.55},{"due_date":"2015-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":5485.09}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.75},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.38},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.23},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.88},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.71},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.51},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.87},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.49},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.74},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.52},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.73},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.5},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.89},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.53},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":64.27}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Christine Haiss","image":1251749}},{"id":984174,"name":"Rukiah","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rukia is a 45-year-old business lady from Busia, Kenya.

She worked an administrator for a realty company there.  She decided to return to Peru with her family because she lost her job.  Her husband got a job as a driver for a poultry processor and from time to time, they gave him chickens.  When her husband was injured in an automobile accident, Flor was obliged to go to work and what could be better than selling the extra chickens around the house.\r\n<p>\r\nFor eight years, Flor earned a living selling chickens until her father asked her to take charge of the cleaning product shop.  Flor says that things are going very well now and her husband helps her tend the shop.  She hopes to open another shop in another market in the near future because the money that she earns isn't enough to pay for both her daughters' schooling and medicine for her husband who suffers from diabetes.\r\n<p><b>Translated from Spanish by Jere Wiseman, Kiva Volunteer<\/b><p>\r\nEl puesto de art\u00edculos de limpieza que Flor T. y su esposo manejan desde hace cuatro le perteneci\u00f3 a su papa.

This is 30 year old Dina B. from Mwanza. She is married and has been running a pharmacy business since 2006. Dina sells different medicines which are used as treatment for different sicknesses.  She works at the business for 12 hours per day, 6 days per week and is assisted by one employee. Dina currently earns about 270USD from her business.

Dina thanks you for your support!\r\n\r\nABOUT SELFINA!\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":303412,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pharmacy","sector":"Health","themes":null,"use":"To purchase more medicine to resell to customers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mwanza","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.516667 32.9","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-04-14T20:20:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Dina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-04-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-27T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-05-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:14:40Z","rounded_local_amount":106160,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613694},{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-06-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:02:36Z","rounded_local_amount":106160,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010773},{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-07-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:39:12Z","rounded_local_amount":106160,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63233059},{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-08-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:53:14Z","rounded_local_amount":106160,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73664850},{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-09-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T02:46:33Z","rounded_local_amount":106160,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87105562}],"funded_date":"2009-04-15T02:52:05Z","paid_date":"2009-10-16T02:46:33Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jennifer Waring","image":null}},{"id":105630,"name":"Marina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs Marina P. is married to Russel P., a driver, and they are blessed with three children.

He has been engaged in this business for over six years and earns approximately 500 WST a month.\r\n\r\nSofarania joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and his ability to engage in business activities.

This previous loan was used to purchase general farm supplies and equipment.\r\n\r\nSofarania is now requesting a new loan of 3,000 WST which will be used to purchase fertilizer such as manure. The loan will be his 6th from SPBD. He plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand his business.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>About SPBD:<\/b>\r\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.

She is Elba Mar\u00eda Bastos, a great entrepreneur that ever since she assumed the responsibility of being a mother, she started selling bottled drinks and ice cream.  With her profits and persistence in saving, she managed to obtain her first refrigerator for the business, and crates of drinks that she would sell first at retail, and progressively at wholesale. With this business, she was able to provide a higher education for her first son, but the extended labor required led her to extreme exhaustion; she decided to change her business to selling fast food, an activity that she does on the weekends and for which she bought a hot dog cart. In her current business, she sells carne asada (grilled steaks), hot dogs, hamburgers, which she combines with other consumables as part of her innovative potential; her food has become a delight in the Costa Hermosa neighborhood, a community of hard working people that appreciate the quality of her products, and the cleanliness of her operation since they know health is a priority for her.

His farm produces pineapples, coffee, tea, milk and maize, which he sells locally. He has also employed a farmhand from his community.\r\n\r\nVincent is 50 years old and married with 6 children, ages ranging between 7 and 18. All the children are currently attending school. He solely depends on the income from his farming activities to cater to the basic needs of the family. He however faces the challenge of drought, which affects his produce and the poor road network.\r\n\r\nVincent has a clean record with Juhudi Kilimo after he successfully completed his previous loan of KES.45,000. He has requested this loan of KES.60,000 to purchase a dairy cow.

She earns her living by operating three business ventures: a general store, buying and selling rice and a catering\/food vending business. Her husband, Ricardo B. Sr., who is 62 years old, also helps in his wife's business activities. They have six children who are 31 to 43 years old. \r\n\r\nRafaela joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2006 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past four loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Rafaela has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 10,000 PHP helped her earn a monthly profit of approximately $200, raising the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 5th cycle loan, she is again borrowing 10,000 PHP, which she intends to use to purchase more stock to sell so that she can continue to save up for future family needs and the payment of debts. Rafaela B. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.\r\n\r\nHelp NWTF continue its mission to help the poorest in the Philippines by clicking  the link to the  NWTF Kiva lending team  on Kiva.org to join our

He is 38 years old and went to school until the 12th grade.  He is married, and he is the father of 2 children.  The first is 5 years old, and the second is 1 year old.  Only the oldest is in school.  Calisto left Inhambane for Namaacha, a town on the border of Swaziland, after he finished the 5th grade.  His oldest brother was transferred to Namaacha and he came with him.  When he arrived he continued with his studies, and consequently he earned a scholarship to be a legal assistant.  He found work in the courts as a legal assistant, but as his institution was not acredited, he did not have the right to a salary.\r\n\r\nThe school entered into contracts, and he was one of the beneficiaries.  He is already on the staff as an assistant instructor.  He works from 7:00am until 12:00pm and earn a monthly sum of 5,900MT.  Besides teaching he has also does advocacy work for his clients who, in spite of being delayed, have had success in the cause process.  Calisto, with help from his wife, who is a health official, was able to collect enough money to begin his work, but he was unable to finish so he approached Hluvuku and solicited a loan for 15,000MT to continue because the rain causes his bricks to break very easily.\r\n\r\nBesides his children, he is responsible for  his sister and nephew who live with him in his house.  This is his first loan with Hluvuku and with Kiva.  The 15,000MT will be used to purchase construction materials to finish his veranda that is being eroded from the rain.  He is confident that he will pay off the loan before maturity and request another to finish the maintenance as well as paint his house.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Jared Wandry, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":303436,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":null,"use":"Purchase construction materials","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MZ","country":"Mozambique","town":"Namaacha","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-25.970278 32.025556","type":"point"}},"partner_id":23,"posted_date":"2009-04-21T17:30:24Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":575,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Calisto Simeao ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MZN","disbursal_amount":15000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":16,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":813.89},{"due_date":"2009-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":847.34},{"due_date":"2009-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":882.16},{"due_date":"2009-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":918.41},{"due_date":"2009-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":956.16},{"due_date":"2009-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":995.45},{"due_date":"2009-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1036.36},{"due_date":"2009-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":1078.95},{"due_date":"2009-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":1123.29},{"due_date":"2010-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":1169.45},{"due_date":"2010-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":1217.51},{"due_date":"2010-03-11T08:00:00Z","amount":1267.55},{"due_date":"2010-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1319.64},{"due_date":"2010-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1373.84}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.2},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.48},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.82},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.21},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.65},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.16},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39.73},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.36},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.06},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.83},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.67},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.59},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.59},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":31.19,"local_amount":813.89,"processed_date":"2009-04-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-20T08:28:28Z","rounded_local_amount":850.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35994951},{"amount":32.48,"local_amount":847.34,"processed_date":"2009-05-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T23:48:44Z","rounded_local_amount":885.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44577727},{"amount":33.82,"local_amount":882.16,"processed_date":"2009-06-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T21:24:47Z","rounded_local_amount":921.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52971092},{"amount":35.22,"local_amount":918.41,"processed_date":"2009-07-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T14:55:00Z","rounded_local_amount":959.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63190919},{"amount":36.65,"local_amount":956.16,"processed_date":"2009-08-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T16:48:52Z","rounded_local_amount":998.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73618800},{"amount":132.1,"local_amount":3446.13,"processed_date":"2009-09-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T19:49:55Z","rounded_local_amount":3599.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87056648},{"amount":136.19,"local_amount":3552.87,"processed_date":"2009-10-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T23:28:03Z","rounded_local_amount":3711.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96971596},{"amount":137.35,"local_amount":3583.04,"processed_date":"2009-12-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T14:23:34Z","rounded_local_amount":3742.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110708741}],"funded_date":"2009-04-21T20:08:59Z","paid_date":"2010-01-15T14:23:34Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":105646,"name":"Delia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Delia es socia del Banco Comunal Golondrinas.\nDelia es casada, tiene 39 a\u00f1os y 5 hijos, Delia junto a su esposo se dedican al alquiler de maquinarias de construcci\u00f3n a instituciones.

(0) is a 38-year-old woman living in the town of Maninoa, Siumu. She is married and has six adult children.\r\n\r\nElena owns and operates a tailoring business, providing children's tailoring services to local community members. She has been engaged in this business for over four years and earns approximately 800 WST a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2004, Elena joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 3,200 WST from SPBD. This previous loan was used to purchase a new sewing machine.\r\n\r\nElena is now requesting a new loan of 3,000 WST which will be used to purchase additional tailoring equipment such as needles and thread. The loan will be her 6th from SPBD. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>About SPBD:<\/b>\r\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self-esteem.\r\n\r\n\r\n<font size=\"1\"> <b>*Note:<\/b> To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Her loans, which were used largely to buy food for chickens, have always been repaid punctually. In the next round, she would like to borrow 7.840.000 VND to invest in her livestock.

Bernadith is the group leader of a 3-member group loan offered by PMPC. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is \"Bernadith C.\u2019s Group\". \r\n\r\nBernadith is 35 years old, married and blessed with four children who are now school-aged. To make a living, she is presently engaged in farming and housekeeping activities. Her husband is a band saw laborer. She\u2019s been engaged in this kind of activity for 10 years already. She\u2019s earning an average amount of not less than Php 2,000 a month from these activities. \r\n\r\nOn December 6, 2007, Bernadith joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  As an active member of Paglaum MPC under the PDP-LP, a micro-finance program that reaches out to rural communities, Bernadith has successfully repaid a loan amount of Php 14,500. She is now requesting a loan of Php 5,000 as her 5th loan which will be used for  house repairs and renovation.

She is requesting her first loan for 1,000 WST, which she will use to purchase baking equipment. Elisapeta plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":932494,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bakery","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to

from Tanzania! Sheila is the owner of a Mama Lishe or local caf\u00e9 in Dar es Salaam. When you see a SELFINA entrepreneur whose business is a restaurant or caf\u00e9, you may have to adjust your mental image of what that is. A local restaurant or caf\u00e9 in Tanzania usually consists of a rough wooden table and some long, wooden benches, with the sky as a ceiling. Such places don't even appear in the Lonely Planet's budget guide, but if you're looking for a cheap and tasty meal, and someone to have a chat with, this is the place to be. The food is all local: rice, ugali (a hot sticky dough, made from maize flour), plantain (a cooked savory banana), all served with beans, vegetables, meat, and a variety of yummy sauces. As a forty-year-old divorced mother of four (one of her children is still in school), profits from the caf\u00e9 are essential to helping her family satisfy their daily needs. Sheila started her caf\u00e9 in 2002 and has since been earning a monthly profit of 200 USD, which she uses towards school fees and food for the family. Sheila is requesting a loan of 275 USD to expand her caf\u00e9 and help propel her business to increased profits and her family to an improved standard of living. The loan will be used to purchase cutlery, crockery, and more chairs for her customers. Sheila is a hard worker who can be found at her caf\u00e9 for long hours every day of the week! Sheila would like to be successful enough to expand her caf\u00e9 to other locations.\r\n<p>\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of microcredit in Tanzania. The organization is devoted to the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through microfinance as a practical way to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women. Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets; because of this, they are deemed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support, hence poor access to basic needs and services. When a client needs working capital to buy a specific item, SELFINA buys the equipment for said client and extends a loan to her. The same equipment is then leased back to the client so they can use it while in process of paying back their loan, a process called a sale-and-leaseback arrangement. Once the loan has been repaid, SELFINA transfers the ownership of the equipment to the client. The advantage of microleasing over traditional microfinance loans is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the

Both are studying in elementary school while she works from 8 AM to 4 PM Monday through Friday.  With 19-years of service as a health worker, she requests a loan to start on the construction of her house.  She would like to build an 8-square metered house in Alcaldia de Juigalpa with the INVUR (Institute of Urban and Rural Housing).  Where Ms. Lidia currently resides she must pay MINSA (Ministry of Health) which operates FETASALUD (Federation of Health Workers) and the conditions there provide no privacy for her growing children.

Each member is currently living in extreme poverty, and is not living with any of the luxuries that we often take for granted. Each member is hoping to take this first loan and get started on their very own small business. The ideas range from clothing stores to food markets. This loan will give an opportunity to 5 people who have not had many good opportunities in their life, and give them a chance to change their future.\r\n\r\nSanta J. is the representative of this group and is extremely excited about this opportunity. Santa is the mother of two young children and realized she needed to do something when she couldn't afford school for both her children.

agriculture business is one that requires much effort, for the simple reason that it requires sun exposure, the physical exertion of moving animals from one place to another, as well as the work it takes to tend to various crops. Abdukayum, has dedicated himself for already twelve years to cattle raising, which supports his humble family which so relies on him.\r\n\r\nCurrently, Abdukayum has turned to IMON International for a loan of 1000 USD to purchase calves that he can raise. It\u2019s important to note that the granting of this loan will not only benefit him, but also his dearest children and wife who he loves greatly.\r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She has two children, ages 12 and 16. They live in Esquilan, which is a community in the Colcapirhua province of Cochabamba. Isabel works in dairy production, and Carlos works in drilling.\r\n\r\nIsabel had various problems in December of 2009; that is when her husband suffered a serious drilling accident that maD. them realize that the company and the job paid poorly. She had to sell her cows in order to help pay for her husband's operations as well as for her children's schooling. Carlos' parents did not want to help; she paid everything herself. Carlos was left without a job -he couldn't walk- and this year in February, he went through another operation for his spine, which went well because he has begun to walk and has started physical therapy in order to be able to work and help his wife and kids. Isabel is a woman who never left Carlos' siD.. In those moments when he was in bad shape, she never lost her faith or hope that Carlos would succeed and fight to become well.\r\n\r\nIsabel is asking for this loan to be able to buy a new head of cattle and so she can to produce more milk and make farm cheese to sell at the Quillacollo market. With this help she can earn more income until her husband is totally recovered and that they can work together so that their children can have careers and a better future and, above all, to teach them the value of life and to continue supporting their father so that he can return to work. Together they are a very united family, and they have dreams they hope to achieve in the future, such as the youngest son who wants to study medicine in order to help children of poor families in their neighborhood and to also help people who need it, like his father needed help after his accident. \r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Sarah Merchlewitz, Kiva

He is married and the father of 12 children. He lives at home in the Dabani borough of the San Prefecture (4th administrative region of the Republic of Mali).\r\n\r\nOver 20 years ago, he opted for the commerce of televisions and related accessories, a business he learned from his older brother. For the past ten years he has been running his own business at the main market in San. He is in high demand, particularly during the weekly market fairs in San and surrounding areas.\r\n\r\nTo diversify his activities, he decided two years ago to call upon the Soro Yiriwaso MFI. He is requesting a third individual loan, having fully reimbursed the two preceding ones. Mr. Abdoulaye will use this loan to buy different televisions, DVD and VCD players (with 14, 21, and 26-inch screens).\r\n\r\nHe used to get his supplies from wholesalers in San, but as he increased his working capital, he now would like to go as far as Lom\u00e9 (the capital of Togo). He sells in his shop at San\u2019s main market and in weekly market fairs, to a customer base of both men and women, for cash or credit.\r\n\r\nHe is hoping to attain monthly earnings of 175,000 FCFA he will use to reimburse the loan, pay his children\u2019s tuition fees, buy food, and reinvest the remainder in other revenue-generating activities.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Ren\u00e9 McConnell, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":975,"image":{"id":540151,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Electronics Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"buy electronic appliances","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"San","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:17Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":975,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Abdoulaye ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-04-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":975,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2010-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2010-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2010-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2010-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2010-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":162.5},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":162.5},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":162.5},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":162.5},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":162.5},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":162.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":325,"local_amount":166666.66,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:17:05Z","rounded_local_amount":170121.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151961545},{"amount":162.5,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T12:01:29Z","rounded_local_amount":85060.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159699664},{"amount":162.5,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:58:13Z","rounded_local_amount":85061,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166913553},{"amount":162.5,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:40:57Z","rounded_local_amount":85060.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172180713},{"amount":162.5,"local_amount":83333.35,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T16:14:08Z","rounded_local_amount":85061.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177476685}],"funded_date":"2010-06-15T21:20:28Z","paid_date":"2010-11-15T16:14:08Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ren\u00e9 McConnell","image":467423}},{"id":204844,"name":"Sashi","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Sashi A. is a farmer in the village of Sainbu-Bhaishipati, Lalitpur.\r\n\r\nSashi owns a piece of land where she grows green vegetables; mostly she prefers to grow seasonal vegetables.

Taba-ao, Sagay City, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by fishing and selling fish.  Her husband Deonesio V., who is 54 years old, works as a fisherman to earn his living.  They have 7 children who are 17 to  34 years old. Carmencita joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2003 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 9 cycle loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Carmencita has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 19500 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 20000,  uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 10th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 15000, which she intends to use purchase more fishing nets and repair her existing nets so that she could continue to save up for future and also repair and improve their fishing boat. Carmencita V. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She is a resident of San Pedro, San Jose Antique, Philippines. She is married to Ruby S. who is a driver and they are blessed with four children. They are Julier who is 36 years old, Glen who is 34 years old, Zaldy who is 31 years old and Charlene who is 29 years old. Through their hardship, industry and the support of ASHI, two of their children have  finished college.\r\n\r\nHer loans in ASHI really help them a lot because the income that they get from her business is used for their daily expenditures.\r\n\r\nAzucena has been a member of ASHI for eight years already and, because of her good attitude, she had been elected as center chief of San Pedro Center 10 of ASHI ASB at present. As a member, she maintains her good performance, which is why she got a bigger loan. \r\n\r\nShe aspires to have a loan from ASHI, through the partnership of KIVA, for PHP 24,000 to use as additional capital for their hog fattening and tricycle businesses.\r\n\r\nIf this request is granted, it will be a great help for them to sustain the needs of the family and to help their relatives and neighbors.\r\n\r\nTheir greatest dream is to build a decent and comfortable house with their income and to improve their business so that they will be financially stable.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":635650,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"As

She and her family are currently living in Hung Nguyen Town, Nghe An Province. In 2007, Mrs. T. joined TYM Fund, who gave her loan to purchase vehicles so her husband could transport goods for customers. Mrs. T. also opens an internet caf\u00e9 at home to increase family\u2019s income. And since she has the advantage of living in a populated area, her business has been relatively lucrative so far. In the next round of loan, Mrs. T. hopes for a loan of 9.000.000 VND ($550) to purchase more facilities (computers) for her internet caf\u00e9. Her family\u2019s monthly income is 4.000.000 VND. <p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Translated from Vietnamese by Khoa Nguyen, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nCh\u1ecb Nguy\u1ec5n Th\u1ecb T. n\u0103m nay 24 tu\u1ed5i.

eleven and twelve. She is thirty-five years old. She started her ice-cream business in 2005. She works six days a week for four hours a day and is assisted by two employees. She earns a monthly profit of about $100 from this business. Pendo is requesting a loan of $450 to purchase another refrigerator and additional containers. She thanks you for your support.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>SELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility as a practical way to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women. Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions as they lack tangible collateral assets. This leads to poor financial support hence poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. When a client needs working capital to buy a specific item, SELFINA buys the equipment for said client and extends a loan to her. The same equipment is then leased back to the client so she can use it while in process of paying back her loan \u00d0 a process called a sale and leaseback arrangement. Once the loan has been repaid, SELFINA transfers ownership of the equipment to the client. The advantage of microleasing over traditional microfinance loans is that is allows clients.<\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":202005,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To purchase a refrigerator and additional containers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mwanza","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.516667 32.9","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-09-15T18:50:28Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":450,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Pendo","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-09-29T20:47:52Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-10-29T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2008-11-29T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2008-12-29T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-01-29T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-03-29T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-04-29T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-05-29T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-06-29T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-07-29T07:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":45,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2008-10-29T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-11-16T08:57:32Z","rounded_local_amount":51840,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373738},{"amount":45,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2008-11-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T04:19:08Z","rounded_local_amount":51840,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5347980},{"amount":45,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2008-12-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-17T09:14:46Z","rounded_local_amount":51840,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9970554},{"amount":45,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-01-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:16:56Z","rounded_local_amount":51840,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14886771},{"amount":45,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:04:23Z","rounded_local_amount":51840,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20436031},{"amount":45,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-03-29T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:57:28Z","rounded_local_amount":51840,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130304},{"amount":45,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-04-29T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:27:00Z","rounded_local_amount":51840,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027135},{"amount":45,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-05-29T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:15:38Z","rounded_local_amount":51840,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613175},{"amount":45,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-06-29T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:03:25Z","rounded_local_amount":51840,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010258},{"amount":45,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-07-29T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:40:09Z","rounded_local_amount":51840,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63232569}],"funded_date":"2008-09-15T20:47:52Z","paid_date":"2009-08-15T18:40:09Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Rachel Brooks","image":643421}},{"id":68812,"name":"Pepe","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Pepe A., 50, is married with 4 children.

Kedepan setelah menerima pinjaman ini rencananya akan dibelikan bibit babi penggemukan sebanyak 2 ekor dulu disamping sekarang di rumahnya juga sudah ada babi-babi dari modal sendiri yang dipelihara. Harga bibit per ekor berkisar Rp.350.000,- dan sisa pinjaman nanti akan digunakan untuk biaya pakan babi selama 6 bulan pemeliharaan. Luh Eka berharap bisa mendapat keuntungan mencapai Rp.500.000,-. Hasil pelihara babi ini diharapkan bisa meningkatkan penghasilan keluarganya dan mampu membiayai anaknya yang masih kecil.","en":"Increased pressures from day to day living expenses, made Luh Eka could not depend on field farming with her husband. Luh Eka tried to increase results from pig farming which is already her side job mornings and evenings. But seeing results from pig raising is quite good,  Luh Eka decided to increase her pig populations by borrowing capital from DINARI for Rp.3,750,000,- (Translator\u2019s note: 1 US$ fluctuates between Rp10,000-12,000.00) for a period of 6 months, and payment at period end after the pigs are sold.

Zone VI, Cadiz City, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating two business ventures:  a general store and a pig-fattening business. Myrna joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2000 because she aspired to something better for her family. With the help of her past sixteen loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Myrna has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty. Her previous loan of PHP 15000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 5200, improving her family's standard of living.  This time, for her seventeenth loan, she is borrowing PHP 17000, which she intends to use to buy more inventory to sell in her general store.  With the increased income, she will continue to save up for the future education of her child. Myrna J. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means \"honorable\"). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed on a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She lives in Purok Bugnay, Barangay Vista Alegre, Ilog, Negros Occidental. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2001 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her buying and selling of Nipa and general store businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of $114. \r\n\r\nJocel is now borrowing 29,500 PHP so that she can purchase more materials.  This will be her 17th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of 29,000 PHP, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Jocel aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well being by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

With this goal in mind, she opened her business. For more than four years, she has run a grocery store.

& 3 (source for the development). She lives in the beautiful town of Samana with her long term partner and their two children. This area, like nearly all impoverished areas of the Dominican Republic, suffers from unreliable running water (none of which is potable) and electricity.\r\n\r\nFiordaliza is receiving her 7th loan with Esperanza Internacional. She started having Esperanza loans and became a member of this group around 4 years ago when she was started doing some business to help her family's income. She is selling cosmetics from a popular brand and who sells their products through their catalog.
