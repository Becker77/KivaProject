She is married and has four children. They live within the Kibera slums of Nairobi. She also takes care of six orphans left behind by her brother who passed away in 2000 due to HIV\/AIDS.\r\n\r\nInitially, Pamela was employed at a salon where she was paid by commission for the work done.  However, the pay was little. She persevered because she had a large family looking up to her. Pamela saved some money from the two years she was employed, which she used to buy a second-hand blowdryer and dryer. Afterwards, through a village merry-go-round group for women, Pamela received Ksh 2,000 (USD 28) which she used to purchase combs, towels and a sink.\r\n\r\nIn 2003, Pamela started her own salon. Due to her skill in hairdressing, including braiding, weaving, perming (chemical application for hair straightening) and styling, the demand for her services has increased. She is therefore requesting a loan of USD 100 to enable her buy an additional blowdryer, four big chairs and two small chairs for the children. \r\n\r\nBecause her clientele has increased, she wants them to be comfortable while waiting to be served.

He is 52, married with two children and lives in the village of Saatli town in the south-central flat area of the Azerbaijan Republic in the Caucasus region.\r\n\r\nNizami has run his business since early childhood when he helped his father to graze the family herd.  After he married and lived separately, Nizami started his own business with two cows given to him as a gift by his father.  Today his number of milk producing cows has risen to 12.  \r\n\r\nNizami sells 120 litres of milk daily in Saatli town, but he sees that he can provide more customers with milk.  To do this he has to increase the number of milk cows in his herd.

Fortunita's dreams are to add on to her house, have a larger selection of products for her business, and that her children go to school and become professionals. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michele Magrino, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":281967,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"For the purchase of sweaters and pants","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":70,"posted_date":"2009-03-08T05:40:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":625,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Fortunita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-02-19T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2009-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2009-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2009-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":156.25},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":156.25},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":156.25},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":156.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":156.25,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2009-03-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T18:12:25Z","rounded_local_amount":511.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27089291},{"amount":156.25,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2009-04-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T16:04:07Z","rounded_local_amount":511.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35982608},{"amount":156.25,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2009-05-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T22:51:16Z","rounded_local_amount":511.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44443124},{"amount":156.25,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2009-06-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T20:24:14Z","rounded_local_amount":511.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52953418}],"funded_date":"2009-03-08T13:23:40Z","paid_date":"2009-07-15T20:24:14Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Michele Magrino","image":387464}},{"id":97114,"name":"Ruth","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ruth owns a poultry farm where she rears poultry birds.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.<P>\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.<P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n<P>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is very active and hardworking since she is responsible for all of her home expenses. She has been a member of the ALCOM \u201cGrupo Unido\u201d for three and a half years together with nine other people and currently holds the position of treasurer in the group. Leila works at selling clothing, shoes and accessories, offering them to all the people she knows, going door to door and visiting companies. She began this business as a young woman because already at 15 years old she had to think about how to take care of her daughter, so she started selling gelatin as a vendor. Thus, she earned a little income, which was 160 soles that she used to buy clothes to sell to her neighbors and friends. In the beginning, she was not earning much due to her lack of experience. With hard work and effort, she has been able to acquire items for her house, furniture, give her daughters an education and help her mother pay off her debt. The requested loan will go towards the down payment on a motorscooter, which will be very useful for transporting her merchandise since she currently must walk a great deal bearing the weight. With a means of transport, it will be easier for her and she will be able to visit more customers. \n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Tara Binetti, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3275,"image":{"id":411260,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Down payment for a motorscooter","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":93,"posted_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:36Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":3275,"lender_count":47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Neridad Esperanza","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marcelina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Jesus","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Leila ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eulogia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Genoveva","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ana Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Emperatriz","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Cesar","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-10-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":9300,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":3275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":2325},{"due_date":"2009-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":2325},{"due_date":"2010-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":2325},{"due_date":"2010-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":2325}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":818.75},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":818.75},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":818.75},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":818.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":818.75,"local_amount":2325,"processed_date":"2009-11-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T12:11:44Z","rounded_local_amount":2333.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103780211},{"amount":491.25,"local_amount":1395,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T12:46:59Z","rounded_local_amount":1400.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110669080},{"amount":1146.25,"local_amount":3255,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:15:22Z","rounded_local_amount":3266.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118064538},{"amount":818.75,"local_amount":2325,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T09:46:22Z","rounded_local_amount":2333.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123899603}],"funded_date":"2009-11-23T02:51:48Z","paid_date":"2010-03-15T09:46:22Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tara Binetti","image":null}},{"id":150496,"name":"Justiniano Fernando","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Justiniano tiene 41 a\u00f1os, es separado , y vive con sus 2 hijos en su casa propia la cual es de adobe.

He considers his business to be rather profitable because it allows him to support his family, invest in his lands, and save for any unexpected event.

She is 60 years old. Restituta is widowed and has 2 adult-aged children. To make a living, Restituta owns & operates a business venture in the food sector operating a mini-restaurant. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from serving a variety of different meals to customers like adobo & afritada in the local community. Restituta has been engaged in her business for over 5 years and earns approximately 10000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Restituta joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Restituta has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to to purchase food & drinks for the restaurant. Restituta is requesting a new loan of 8000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional ingredients like meat & vegetables & working capital. This loan will be the 2nd loan taken out by Restituta from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

L. mujer\u201d is a small rural community bank of FINCA Peru\u2019s Wari-project which provides its credit with educational services in the rural areas of Huancavelica. Huancavelica is considered one of the poorest regions of Peru and has many limitations, being a very mountainous area (altituD. ranges from 6,000 \u2013 17,000 ft above sea level). People there also face the cold, the difficulty growing crops, and the lack of an adequate infrastructure of roads and communication systems.\r\n<P>\r\nBCR \u201cAmanecer D. L. mujer\u201d, whose name can be translated as the \u201cAwakening of the Woman\u201d, is located in the community of AntacalL. in the district of Anco, province of Churcampa. The main activities of the population are growing corn (lower altitudes), potatoes and wheat (higher altitudes); raising guinea-pigs, pigs, and chicken, and they also have cows and bulls. The community of AntacalL. faces many difficulties due to its remoteness, lack of public transportation and access to markets. It receives very little in the way of public and social services. <P>\r\n\r\nThe bank has just completed half a year of existence and its first loan-cycle, with currently 11 female borrowers and a total loan of 3,600 soles (about US$ 1,240). The loans range from 100, 200, 400 soles, up to 600 soles. Besides repaying their loans, the group was able to save over 1,500 soles (about US$ 520)  during the first loan-cycle, and they will continue to put asiD. savings in the future.<P>\r\n\r\nDuring their first loan cycle, most members have learned how to do business. Whereas before most of their production was for home consumption, more and more they have learned to be entrepreneurs, to earn a little money with the work they do.  And, sometimes for the first time in their lives, they have learned how to improve the quality of their lives and the importance of saving.\r\n<P>\r\nOne of the members of the community bank is Saturnina Dur\u00e1n Chacasan. Saturnina buys and sells \"tuna\", the fruit of the tuna-cactus. Besides buying the fruit down at the Mantaro river-basin, she grows her own tuna in a small field of tuna-cactuses. She sells her tunas in one of the major cities in the central Peruvian Andes, Huancayo, more than 5 hours away from AntacalL.--at least, when she is lucky enough to find transportation. Her new loan of 500 soles, she will not invest in her tuna-business, however. This time she will buy a cow! Starting a new business! Although the cow will cost her 1,000 soles, she will put in the other half of the price of the cow herself, from her savings. One of the things she learned in FINCA Peru is not to talk badly of other people.<P>\r\n\r\nAnother story is that of Florentina M. Dur\u00e1n, who has her business of baking and selling bread. Like all women in the community bank, she also has her fields with corn and wheat. Most of the production is for home consumption, but fortunately she also is able to sell some of her product. She will invest her 200 soles loan to buy more wheat for her bakery.\r\n<P>\r\nRosa Ana S. D. L. C., who has requested a 400 soles loan, has a small business selling shoes, and Sundays when AntacalL. has its weekly market, she also sells meals. She will invest her loan in buying new shoes for her business. It's a good time for that, because schools are about to start again, and most children need new shoes to go with their school uniforms. And, like most members of her group, her dream is for her family to improve their quality of life and for her four children to study. She will use her savings for buying school necessities because a new school year is starting."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1275,"image":{"id":137343,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"expanding their small businesses or starting up new ones","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":70,"posted_date":"2008-03-20T16:10:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1275,"lender_count":27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Susana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dionicia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Norberte","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosa Ana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mayela Elvira","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maribel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Florentina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Saturnina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Saturnina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Regina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-04-03T21:11:29Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3600,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":1275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2008-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2008-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2008-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2008-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2008-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":600}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":212.5},{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":212.5},{"due_date":"2008-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":212.5},{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":212.5},{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":212.5},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":212.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":213,"local_amount":601.41,"processed_date":"2008-05-03T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T03:52:47Z","rounded_local_amount":613.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":199956},{"amount":213,"local_amount":601.41,"processed_date":"2008-06-03T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T03:53:45Z","rounded_local_amount":613.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":226957},{"amount":213,"local_amount":601.41,"processed_date":"2008-07-03T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T04:00:29Z","rounded_local_amount":613.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":256202},{"amount":213,"local_amount":601.41,"processed_date":"2008-08-03T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T04:03:08Z","rounded_local_amount":613.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":284933},{"amount":213,"local_amount":601.41,"processed_date":"2008-09-03T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-09-09T01:56:29Z","rounded_local_amount":613.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315124},{"amount":210,"local_amount":592.94,"processed_date":"2008-10-03T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-10T07:20:18Z","rounded_local_amount":604.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":346665}],"funded_date":"2008-03-20T21:11:29Z","paid_date":"2008-10-10T07:20:18Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":43860,"name":"Kulwa's Umoja Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Kulwa M. is 58 years old, married and has two children, ages 21 and 19.

I. is 36 years old and lives in a monogamous family with one child in the area of Attbougou, one of the outlying areas of the city of S\u00e9gou (the fourth administrative region of the republic of Mali). For social reasons, she left school early. After attempting many profit-generating businesses without success, her grandmother taught her the secret art of incense (traditional deodorant) production. She finished her apprenticeship and for the last 10 years has practiced this business. Today, she enjoys the benefits of a good reputation on a regional scale. She receives orders from all over the sub-region of West Africa (Burkina Faso, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire). To make a good quality incense with a pleasant smell requires magnonkis\u00e8ni, an exotic plant highly valued in West Africa, to be seasoned with perfumes and eau de Cologne for one month. To satisfy her growing clientele, she decided two years ago to join Soro Yiriwaso microfinance institution. After four joint group loans all which were properly repaid, she has requested her first individual loan. With this loan she plans to purchase 30 kg of incense seed (magnonkis\u00e8ni), 70 kg of K\u00e8ni (natural incense), 15 boxes of perfume (including eau de Cologne) and empty bottles. She gets her supplies mostly from the large market in the city of S\u00e9gou and sells her product for cash or on credit to a clientele composed mainly of women and men from Mali and neighboring countries. When weddings take place she is in very high demand due to the fact that her product is highly valued by newlyweds. She plans to earn a monthly income of 50,000 FCFA which will be used mainly to increase her business capital. Her dream is to build a new home. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Allana Carlyle, Kiva

The rainy season is the most difficult time for Juan as his sales are very low during this time.  He has had his business for 6 years and feels that it is time to grow.  He always takes some sweets from his stand to give to his beloved nephews, who love him like a father.  This is the first loan that Juan has applied for and he is confident that he will be able to make the payments on time.  He is one of the most active members of his community bank and is well loved and respected.  With the money from the loan he will purchase more merchandise to help grow his business.\r\n\r\n <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Matthew Raimondi, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":271200,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To increase his inventory","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Juliaca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15.5 -70.133333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-02-16T06:30:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":175,"lender_count":4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juan","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-02-04T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2009-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2009-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2009-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2009-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2009-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":85}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":29.05},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.05},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.05},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.05},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.05},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":29.05,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2009-03-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:31:54Z","rounded_local_amount":94.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27117057},{"amount":29.04,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2009-04-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:44:01Z","rounded_local_amount":94.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36011970},{"amount":29.05,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T01:01:24Z","rounded_local_amount":94.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44595555},{"amount":29.05,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2009-06-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:37:08Z","rounded_local_amount":94.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52989817},{"amount":29.06,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2009-07-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:39:59Z","rounded_local_amount":94.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63210953},{"amount":29.75,"local_amount":85,"processed_date":"2009-08-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:17:57Z","rounded_local_amount":96.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73640458}],"funded_date":"2009-02-16T06:53:05Z","paid_date":"2009-09-15T19:17:57Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Matt Raimondi","image":549898}},{"id":93034,"name":"Jesus Antonio","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Jes\u00fas es socio del Banco Comunal Las Gaviotas.\nJes\u00fas es conviviente, tiene 38 a\u00f1os y 3 hijos, Jes\u00fas de acuerdo a la temporada y demanda vende diferentes productos como en \u00e9poca escolar vende mochilas, en carnavales talco, serpentinas.

For example, the SOAT, which is an insurance that covers all medical treatments for his passengers in case of an accident.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Today, Marino continues to follow this path, partly since he could not finish school because his parents did not have enough money to support him.  That's how he started cultivating cocoa, working hard from dawn until dusk.  These days, however, his work is much more efficient, as he uses a technique that is better than the traditional one.

This is the reason he has come to microfinance partner MFP to ask for a loan to fulfill his goals.  This will be his first loan with MFP, and he promises to pay his installments punctually.

She has 7 children, two of which live with her in her home.  Her husband was a farmer and acquired land to farm and for his children to live on when he was alive.  Now Luc\u00eda is alone, and her oldest children have moved to the cities.  Since then her plantings have decreased, and she only grows enough for her personal consumption.  She rents the rest of the land to generate economic income.  Now she dedicates most of her time to raising livestock.  She mainly has cows and rams.  At 5:00 a.m. she prepares her food and feeds her dogs, who are experts in rounding up the rams, and leaves to graze her animals.  Luc\u00eda is very happy with agriculture and caring for her animals.  If she needs money urgently, she sells some of her animals.  To attend all of the payment meetings of her communal bank, on those days she feeds her animals in the corral and they don't go out to graze.  This is her eighth loan with MFP, and in all of this time she has repaid them punctually.  The money that she is requesting will go towards preparing her farmland so it will be ready for the next planting.

Also worth mentioning is that they own their own vehicle, and he uses it as a taxi during the day and at night he rents it to a driver, and his wife distributes citrus fruits wholesale to the markets, both occupations being very good fields of work.  The couple have built a good and steady client base with whom they work directly, all this yielding a steady income for them.

A mother of a family, she lives with her husband in the Lives sector, a rural area in the district of Uni\u00f3n Agua Blanca of San Miguel province, in the Cajamarca region. It is located in the mountainous part of the country, four hours away from the city of Chiclayo, capital of the Lambayeque region. \r\n\r\nSince she was very young, Presila has been working in agriculture and cattle farming. She and her husband grow different crops and sell the milk produced by their animals. The income from these activities has supported them since they got married and allowed them to raise their children who are already independent and have formed families of their own.\r\n\r\nThe area where Presila and her husband live is known for the cultivation of various grains and cereals. This season, they have sown corn and peas; they hope that the crops will result in enough income to allow them to make ends meet over the following months. Presila would like weed out and fertilize the crops that she and her husband have sown. This is why she approached Edpyme Alternativa for the first time to seek a loan of 2000 soles.\r\n\r\nPresila is a very hard-working woman who is devoted to her family. Her greatest wish is to bring a better quality of life to her family and make improvements to her home, which is currently made from rustic materials.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by

She lives in Sitio Daan Banwa, Brgy. Su-ay, Himamaylan City, Negros Occidental. \r\n\r\nAzucena has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 1989 and has improved her living conditions with the help of loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her hog fattening  business, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average income of 15,000 Philippine pesos (PHP). \r\n\r\nAzucena is borrowing 29,500 PHP so that she can buy an additional hog for future income. This will be her 22nd loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of 29,500 PHP (which she paid off well within its term) was just another step on her journey towards economic freedom. Azucena hopes to improve her family's living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the <i>Dungganon<\/i> way. \r\n\r\n<b>About NWTF:<\/b>\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project <i>Dungganon<\/i> (a Hiligaynon word that means <u>honorable<\/u>). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them <i>Dungganon<\/i> - a title of esteem  that is bestowed on a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Many head of cattle have passed through her care. \r\n\r\nNowadays she owns a cow with a calf. It yields fresh milk every morning which she distributes to her regular customers. Buraima remembers how, being a young lady in 1971, she started with the purchase of her first cow, in which she put big hopes, and spent the last savings in her family budget. At that time, she and her husband were a young couple and her husband was farmer. Since that time, milk products bring in a significant portion of Buraima\u2019s income. \r\n\r\nThanks to those financial assets, she raised three kids, helped with their employment and finished major repairing at her house. She invests her monthly income of about $215 back into her business. This time she needs some financial assistance in purchasing one more cow.

Nana\u2019s husband works in the family-owned cornfield, where 2 - 3 tonnes of maize are harvested for the season. The total harvest is used on the farm for feeding the animals. \r\n\r\nWith the requested loan, Nana plans to purchase construction materials for a new cattle shed. The existing one is already too small and doesn\u2019t allow Nana to plan future expansion of the family\u2019s farming activities.

For lack of adequate working capital, Millicent buys a few stocks of lace materials and garment cloth and sells through hawking.

","en":"Ra\u00fal is 27 years old, is a calm and responsible man, and lives with the mother of his only son in his aunt\u2019s house. Since he was a child, he has worked in agriculture and has taken care of his plants. Now, he and his partner have decided to work together because they want to go forward by means of their crops. For this, they have rented farms, where they will sow potatoes and peas. They will pay between 280 and 340 soles for each planting. At the same time, they have joined the community lands so that in later years they will be able to become co-proprietors. Ra\u00fal is very happy with his agricultural work. For this, he wakes up very early so that at 8 in the morning he can begin his work, and he catches up with his wife at lunch. To achieve very good harvests this season, he hopes to have the opportunity to buy land that is easily accessible by cars, so that he can avoid transportation work during the harvest months. Though he joined later, his peers at the community bank got their ninth loan from MFP. For this, his fifth loan, he will continue paying his installments punctually. The money he is requesting will be invested to buy chemical fertilizers for his potato crop. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Avni Shah, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":825,"image":{"id":352149,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy fertilizers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-07-14T17:30:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":825,"lender_count":30,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ra\u00fal","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-06-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":825,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":2500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":825}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":825,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2009-12-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T15:22:35Z","rounded_local_amount":2512.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734037}],"funded_date":"2009-07-16T03:42:41Z","paid_date":"2010-01-15T15:22:35Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Avni","image":null}},{"id":125834,"name":"William De Los Reyes","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El se\u00f1or William S\u00e1nchez M. tiene  37 a\u00f1os de edad, es casado y actualmente tiene un hijo el cual es menor de edad.

He is a hardworking man who lives with his wife, Cledina, who is 33 years old and with whom he has 2 children. They all live together in their own house, in the town of Patay. He has been working in agriculture for more than 13 years, planting potatoes and peas on some pieces of land he owns. Generally his wife is in charge of the domestic work and caring for their children. \r\n\r\nWhat Delbor likes most is cultivating potatoes and watching them as they grow because he is very careful with his crops; he is certain that taking good care of the land is the key to having successful harvests. On the other hand, he dislikes fighting against the climatic variations. The wind and the rain are very strong and they don\u2019t let the plants develop normally. He is steadfast and continues in his work because he finds his work profitable since it allows him to cover educating his children, the costs of his household, and to save to buy more land so he can plant more. He has also been able to open a small grocery store in his house. \r\n\r\nThis is his fourth loan with MFP, and he is happy to continue working with the members of his communal bank, who all work actively. With his loan he plans to buy several sacks of organic fertilizer for his next planting. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jennifer Day, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":580478,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy sacks of organic fertilizer.

Bernadette has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional inventory and working capital. Bernadette is requesting a new loan of 15,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This will be the third loan taken out by Bernadette from ASKI.

","en":"Irene is a native of the state of Michoac\u00e1n. She is 58 years old and has a fifth-grade education. She says she stopped going to school because her parents didn't want her to continue her education due to a lack of financial resources because she had many siblings and they couldn't afford to buy books. Irene is married to Pedro, who makes a living as a construction worker. They have seven children, of which two live with them: Guadalupe, 21, and Tomasa, 12, who is in school. Irene runs a convenience store out of her home and makes a living selling ornamental flowers, avocados and chili peppers, since she has a garden and a nursery. She goes out on boats to sell them to suppliers in the city of Zitacuaro, and almost always what she sells is on order from customers. Irene is requesting the loan from Kiva partner Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad to purchase eggs, sugar, soups, beans and other products of more primary need. She says that previously she made a living on selling seasonal fruits and legumes in the regional street markets but for health reasons she decided to open a store out of her home since her back and bones ached out of the effort from loading the very heavy cargo into the boats. She says that she and her clients are going to benefit from the loan because they won't go to other, more remote stores and will be able to find everything they need in her store. Irene will also be able to sell her avocados and chili peppers out of her home. Her goal is to expand her garden of avocados and chili peppers and also stock her store with products so that her local customers don't have to travel to Zitacuaro or have travel expenses. Irene says that her store is going very well and that her avocado and chili pepper sales are gaining customers in her area. She says with the earnings she makes she will paint and remodel her home."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":720317,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Purchase supplies to stock her store","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Zitacuaro, Estado de Michoac\u00e1n.","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2011-03-09T03:10:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Irene","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-02-24T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":5000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":432.78},{"due_date":"2011-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":465.23},{"due_date":"2011-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":475.27},{"due_date":"2011-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":485.52},{"due_date":"2011-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":496},{"due_date":"2011-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":506.7},{"due_date":"2011-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":517.63},{"due_date":"2011-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":528.8},{"due_date":"2011-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":540.21},{"due_date":"2011-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":551.86}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.79},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.54},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.4},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.27},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.16},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.07},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.94},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.92},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.91}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":76.33,"local_amount":898.01,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:10:33Z","rounded_local_amount":923.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201292471},{"amount":81.67,"local_amount":961.01,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:09:04Z","rounded_local_amount":988.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206160729},{"amount":85.23,"local_amount":1002.48,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:21:53Z","rounded_local_amount":1031.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211233603},{"amount":181.77,"local_amount":2138.5,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:12:22Z","rounded_local_amount":2200.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216512428}],"funded_date":"2011-03-09T09:08:31Z","paid_date":"2011-07-15T11:12:22Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Marty Greenstein","image":null}},{"id":282391,"name":"Jaqueline","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jacqueline is 49 years old and is married with three children.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling animal feed and farm-related products in the local community. Anecita has been engaged in this business for over 14 years and earns approximately 5,000 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 1997, Anecita joined NWTF to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Anecita has successfully repaid a previous loan of 19,000 PHP from NWTF. Anecita is now requesting a new loan of 19,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. The loan will be her 17th loan taken out from NWTF. Anecita plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay the tuition fees of her children.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc., has answered the calls of not just of a few but thousands of women.

He has a business selling metal boxes and other items to the local people for the past two years. He says that this business is profitable and the only major challenges he has are that there are very many people in the area doing the same kind of business as his, hence customers are spoiled for choice, and high prices of raw materials. However, he works very hard to keep his business doing well. \r\n\r\nMutunga is using his loan of Kes 50,000 to buy more scrap metal to make the metal boxes to sell.

Socorro is the group leader of a seven-member group loan offered by ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nMa. Socorro is 37 years old, married, and has three school-aged children. To make a living, Ma. Socorro owns and operates a  general store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling both food and daily use products in the local community. Ma. Socorro is just starting this business.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Ma. Socorro joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Ma. Socorro has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from ASKI, which was used to purchase additional products to sell. Ma. Socorro is requesting a new loan of 9,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be Ma. Socorro's second loan from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 38 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherpeople, and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":664713,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To purchase additional products to sell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Carabatan Chica, Cauayan City, Isabela","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":123,"posted_date":"2010-12-14T20:40:11Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ma.

In order to properly care for her family, she left her job teaching pre-school, where she cared for children under 5 years old.  Her husband works for the local government as an agricultural engineer for rural development projects.  Aware of the expenses she caused in leaving her job, she opened a small bookstore in her house where she sells paper, pens, notebooks, and other desk supplies.  However, she is most passionate about farming.  She grows coffee, which she harvests once a year, on her four hectares of farmland and later sells the grains to the Sanchirio Palomar area cooperative through her father, who is one of the members of the cooperative.  Now she wants to improve her production and continue progressing with her business.  She belongs to the Desarrollando para el Progreso de Prisma Communal Bank and this is her first loan with MFP, where she is sure that she will meet her goals.  Lizet is getting ready for the school year and her coffee harvest.  For this reason, she plans to use the loan to purchase organic manure, office supplies, and use the rest to pay the farm workers that she will hire to collect the first coffee beans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":732658,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bookstore","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy school items and materials to sell for the school year, as well as to hire workers to pick coffee beans","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-03-17T17:40:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lizet ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-03-11T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":375}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":375,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:47:28Z","rounded_local_amount":1038,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232850706}],"funded_date":"2011-03-17T19:07:50Z","paid_date":"2011-10-15T09:47:28Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen O'Connell","image":578556}},{"id":286506,"name":"Olive","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Olive M. is 25 years old, married to a barber and has two children who are three years old and two months old.

She tells us that her business is going very well because she has good customers who come to her for the good service that she provides and for her good work.  She would like to continue stocking her business and so is requesting a loan to buy clothing and tools which she needs for her blacksmith's such as iron, sheets of metal, paints, etc.  She is grateful to Fundaci\u00f3n Paraguaya and Kiva for the opportunity that they are giving her."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3250,"image":{"id":905826,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Blacksmith","sector":"Manufacturing","themes":null,"use":"to buy iron, sheets of metal, paint and other products","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PY","country":"Paraguay","town":"Ciudad del Este","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-25.516667 -54.616667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":58,"posted_date":"2011-11-04T11:00:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":3250,"lender_count":112,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Guillermina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dominga ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mirian ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Leidy ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Adelaida ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosalina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Modesta ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Claudelina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ilda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Johana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bernarda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Paola ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Germania ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Digna ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Liliana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PYG","disbursal_amount":13544535,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":3250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-04T07:00:00Z","amount":2257423},{"due_date":"2011-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":2257423},{"due_date":"2012-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":2257423},{"due_date":"2012-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":2257423},{"due_date":"2012-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":2257423},{"due_date":"2012-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":2257420}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":541.67},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":541.66},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":541.67},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":541.67},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":541.66},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":541.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":541.67,"local_amount":2257423,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:02:38Z","rounded_local_amount":2266875.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244571014},{"amount":541.66,"local_amount":2257423,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:09:12Z","rounded_local_amount":2266875.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250782319},{"amount":541.67,"local_amount":2257423,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T10:23:52Z","rounded_local_amount":2266875.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257190763},{"amount":541.67,"local_amount":2257423,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:38:09Z","rounded_local_amount":2266875.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263326992},{"amount":541.66,"local_amount":2257423,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T09:36:49Z","rounded_local_amount":2266875.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270041093},{"amount":541.67,"local_amount":2257420,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-16T08:31:34Z","rounded_local_amount":2266872.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276653263}],"funded_date":"2011-11-09T08:39:07Z","paid_date":"2012-05-16T08:31:34Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Oxnard","image":null}},{"id":356206,"name":"Susan","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Susan is 50 years old and lives in Canubay, Oroquieta City.

M. is a single mother who raised 10 children on her own and is the proud grandmother of 22 grandchildren who all still reside close together in Samana. One of her oldest sons helps her run a store selling food staples. Her store features her renowned chicken that Julia claims is the freshest around. She purchases live chickens from local markets, then plucks and prepares them for resale from her store.
