This is 32-year-old Tulibasobi M. from Kyela. She is widow with two children between the ages of 13 and 15.\n\nTulibasobi has been selling vitenge and rice since 2002. She sells traditional clothing worn by Tanzanian women, called kanga and vitenge. The kanga is a piece of printed cotton fabric often with a border along all four sides. It is printed using the silkscreen method with its pattern in frames. Kitenge (the Swahili plural is vitenge) is a cotton fabric with a wax print, printed by using rotary printing machines. Kitenge is a communicating textile - the various colors, patterns, writings and symbols represent moods, feelings, cultures, and traditions of native African people.\n\nTulibasobi works at the business for 9 - 12 hours per day, 6 days per week. She currently earns about 350 USD a month from her business.\n\nTulibasobi is requesting a loan of 325 USD in order to purchase more vitenge and crops in bulk. In the future, she plans to open the same business at another location. Tulibasobi thanks you for your support!\n\nABOUT SELFINA: \nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use their equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":303771,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing

He is very responsible and a bit shy. He currently lives in a rented house. Eight months ago, he started a grocery business in his home which is very close to a local school. Since classes have started up again, his sales of candies have grown. For this reason, he has started preparing other snacks and desserts such as jello, stuffed potatoes and lollipops which he sells during the school's recess. In this way, Edgar can earn the money he needs to pay his rent and personal expenses. This makes him very happy with his business and it was one of his dreams to have his own store. Now that he has one, he would like to save up to buy land and build his own home. \r\n\r\nThis is his second loan with MFP.

She lives at home with her mother in the Maica Central area of the city of Cochabamba.  \r\n\r\nSeminia married very young, so she had to begin working from a young age to support her new family.

Teresita has been engaged in her business for over 12 years and earns approximately 4,500 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Teresita joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Teresita has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10,000 PHP from HSPFI. Teresita is requesting a new loan of 12,000 PHP which to purchase additional products to sell. This will be Teresita's fourth loan taken from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, we created this template for our field staff to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She would like to continue this collaboration with Soro Yiriwaso in order to cultivate her land better and derive a bigger income from it.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":811043,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"to pay the costs of manual labor and buy seeds, fertilizers etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Tamba","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:20Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Safiatou Sibiri ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Awa Sidiki ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alimatou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatoumata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Aminata Thino ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Achitan Issa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-06-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":145000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":145000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":325}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":325,"local_amount":145000,"processed_date":"2012-03-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-11T08:20:03Z","rounded_local_amount":150033.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270139825}],"funded_date":"2011-08-02T21:07:15Z","paid_date":"2012-05-11T08:20:03Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Katharina S","image":340594}},{"id":319694,"name":"Liberty","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Liberty is a 28-year-old married woman who lives in Lopez Jaena, Misamis Occidental, Philippines.

Her customers come from Benin, Nigeria and Ghana. With her business, Mrs. A. has been able to construct her own home. Continually presented with competition by others who enter into the pearl trade, she needs to find ways to remain competitive. This is difficult with her limited stock. In order to improve this, she is asking for a loan of 500,000 FCFA in order to purchase one container of pearls. With her new stock, she will be able to improve her sales. <p>Translated from French to English by Kiva Volunteer, Kristin Connor.<p>\r\n\r\n\r\nN\u00e9e le 12 octobre 1956 \u00e0 Lom\u00e9, Madame A.

He says that both places are very far from his house and it is difficult for him to get to them given that the roads are not in very good condition and there is also poor public transportation. \r\n\r\nBecause of this Miguel has decided to purchase a motorcycle to be able to ease the way he travels and to be able to save time and make the most of it. For this he needs a loan of 400,000 CRC to purchase the motorcycle and in that way have his own vehicle that will allow him to continue moving forward and will facilitate his way of travel. \r\n\r\nMiguel is part of the Bancruce Communal Finance Institution, one the 100 organizations that are members of EDESA in Costa Rica.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from raising cattle for sale. Esperideon has been engaged in his business for over five years and earns approximately 6,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Esperideon joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Esperideon has successfully repaid a previous loan of 25,000 PHP from GDMPC. This previous loan was used to purchase additional animals. Esperideon is requesting a new loan of 25,000 PHP which will be used to purchase livestock feed and other supplies. This loan will be the second loan taken out by Esperideon from GDMPC. He plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement the family's income. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three units offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental.

She is 35 years old and married with four school-aged children. To make a living, Alicia raises pigs for sale. Alicia has been engaged in her business for over five years and earns approximately $68 a month from this activity.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Alicia joined the Kiva field partner, ASKI, to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation by engaging in business activities. Alicia has successfully repaid a previous loan of 15,000 PHP from ASKI. Alicia is requesting a new loan of 20,000 PHP which will be used to purchase livestock feed and other supplies. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay the tuition fees of her children. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful micro-finance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

She has successfully repaid a previous loan from ASKI. This loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Lery is requesting a new loan of 8,000 PHP, which will also be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be her second from ASKI.

Throughout Luis' life, he has had to work in the fields to survive. Since he was very young, his parents taught him how to work on the farm, and for this reason he decided to continue in the family profession. He now has his own fields, where he grows coffee and bananas. Once his crops are harvested, he takes them to sell at the market in the city of La Merced. He has done this work for 10 years, and he continues to enjoy planting, since he knows that his family's well-being depends on his work. What he considers most difficult is protecting his crops from abrupt changes in the weather, since these greatly affect his productivity. In the future, he hopes to continue working hard and improving his crops. This is his third loan with MFP, and he knows that it will be very beneficial for the development of his farm.

Jose G. is a very humble and hard working person that dreams of having a home in a good state of repair. He works together with his wife in the central market of the municipality in La Union. They sell fruits and vegetables, a business they have had for the past 2 years. It is thanks to this business that they are able to provide for all of the household needs.  The home they live in is rented. Jose and his wife are very responsible people and they dream of having a safe home where to live comfortably. For this reason Jose requests a loan, so that they may continue building their own home. With this loan he will be able to purchase all the necessary material, such as: cement, bricks, iron rods, roofing, etc. He will use these materials to finish building their home and have their own home in which to live. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Erika Lindig, Kiva

He has been married for 32 years to Petrona, age 51. They have 5 children together, 2 of whom are school aged, and 3 of whom are grown and are professionals, thanks to their parents. 20 years ago, he started with a small store in his home. His wife tended to the store while he worked on buying animals to do farm work, which they would later sell for meat in the store. The whole family works together in the store now, as it is the most important and highly-trafficked store in the city. He now wants to buy more merchandise such as drinks and basic staples such as flour, yerba, noodles and rice in bulk in order to get lower prices and thus obtain better earnings from the sales.<br

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She scours the village streets riding on her pedicab (rickshaw), collecting each household\u2019s rubbish.  Her husband does the same routine in other areas.  Before they dump everything at the city\u2019s waste disposal facility, they salvage anything of value, such as paper, bottles, and scrap metals, and sell these to buyers who in turn sell them to foundries and large junk shops.  After her daily garbage collection, she tends her ukay-ukay store (used clothing).  She earns more than P13,000 per month from these activities.\r\n\r\nChinita joined the Center for Community Transformation (CCT) Credit Cooperative in 2006.  This time, she has applied for a new P20,000 loan with CCT to purchase parts for the repair of her pedicab, and for her used clothing business.\r\n \r\nIt has been Chinita\u2019s long sought-after dream to have her own house and business lot, including her own junk shop.

Her goal is to fatten the livestock to be able to sell them at a good price, to pray for her loan and to help her improve their quality of life.\r\n\r\nMaricruz is a hardworking and attentive woman who has always known to keep moving forward to improve in life and to achieve what she wants.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":771222,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase poultry and feed.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Urubamba - Urubamba - Cusco","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":119,"posted_date":"2011-05-19T18:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":200,"lender_count":6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maricruz","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-05-09T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":75.53},{"due_date":"2011-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":78.53},{"due_date":"2011-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":81.65},{"due_date":"2011-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":84.89},{"due_date":"2011-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":88.25},{"due_date":"2011-11-05T07:00:00Z","amount":91.15}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.21},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.41},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.66},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.96},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.3},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.46}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":30.21,"local_amount":75.53,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T10:36:12Z","rounded_local_amount":83.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216455823},{"amount":31.41,"local_amount":78.53,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:21:04Z","rounded_local_amount":86.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221619470},{"amount":32.66,"local_amount":81.65,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T08:32:07Z","rounded_local_amount":90.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":226988259},{"amount":33.96,"local_amount":84.89,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T08:26:23Z","rounded_local_amount":93.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232746959},{"amount":35.3,"local_amount":88.25,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T09:28:17Z","rounded_local_amount":97.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238551167},{"amount":36.46,"local_amount":91.15,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:18:56Z","rounded_local_amount":100.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244510121}],"funded_date":"2011-05-19T18:45:22Z","paid_date":"2011-12-15T09:18:56Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":303335,"name":"David","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"David is 42 years old and operates Nyagah Metal works where he makes window frames and doors.

She studied through her 3rd year of high school and afterwards studied fashion and clothing production for 6 months in the Elizabeth Harden Institute in Trujillo, Peru.  She could not finish studying because she had to take care of her daughters while they were small.  She has three children:  two are married and one is still in high school.  She lives in the city of Trujillo, in the province of Trujillo, La Libertad, Peru.\r\n\r\nTo improve her economic situation, fifteen years ago she started a business selling electric stoves in Tacora.  Now she sells groceries in her home; in the afternoons she sells mazamorra (a local dessert); however, sometimes she does not have time to sell her mazamorra because she has to wash clothing for neighbors.  She also works by sewing sheets for a hotel.  She has worked with the Manuela Ramos institution for a year after a friend invited her to participate in the Successful Women II village bank.  She decided to participate in the bank because she wanted to grow her business, and with her first loan of $175, she purchased butter, cookies, rice, sugar, and one display case where she could show her mazamorra.\r\n\r\nWith this $400 loan which she will repay in 4 months, she would like to invest in the purchase of one display case, one scale, milk, toilet paper, cleaning supplies, cocoa, and vegetable oil.  She dreams of having a \u201cminimarket,\u201d since all the money she earns through her business helps her daughter to finish studying so she can become a professional.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Scott Crandall, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":202268,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Purhcase of a display case, a scale, and various groceries","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Trujillo-Trujillo-La Libertad","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.115994 -79.02998","type":"point"}},"partner_id":72,"posted_date":"2008-10-01T07:01:21Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Teresa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-10-15T16:01:37Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1200,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2008-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2009-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2009-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":300}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":100}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":100,"local_amount":300,"processed_date":"2008-11-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-16T07:54:20Z","rounded_local_amount":300.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5330793},{"amount":100,"local_amount":300,"processed_date":"2008-12-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T00:47:57Z","rounded_local_amount":300.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9951163},{"amount":100,"local_amount":300,"processed_date":"2009-01-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T13:43:54Z","rounded_local_amount":300.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":10224190},{"amount":100,"local_amount":300,"processed_date":"2009-02-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T19:47:21Z","rounded_local_amount":300.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20416926}],"funded_date":"2008-10-01T16:01:37Z","paid_date":"2009-03-16T19:47:21Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Scott Crandall","image":163705}},{"id":68956,"name":"Israyil","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Israyil M. is 28 years old.

In this area, you can find an abundance of pine trees, eucalyptus trees and quinua plants.  The region identifies itself with the stone frog, <em>qampato<\/em>, and its myths and stories.  Since its foundation, the area has been very welcoming, despite being a small town.  The main activity of the town is cattle farming.  Here, you can find cows, horses and sheep living in open spaces suitable for the breeding of such animals.  Farmers plant crops in tracts and grow a natural form of a native potato species.  Women involved in businesses knit and weave socks, <em>chullos<\/em> (a type of hat), caps, shawls, etc.\r\n<p>\r\nIsidora Q. is married and has 8 children.  She is a weaver and buys and sells cloth.  The most difficult challenge she has faced is when her land was taken over.  The people who took her land threw rocks at her and she was hit many times and became sick.  Her life changed.  With FINCA Peru, she learned solidarity, to become a saver and be punctual in her payments.  She is grateful to FINCA because they lent her 400 nuevos soles without difficulty and trusted her.  For this reason, they elected her to be President of the village bank.  She purchases merchandise and brings it to other places to barter, exchanging meat for cloth.  Isidora's dream is to have enough food to eat everyday and have more livestock, mostly cows and sheep.\r\n<p>\r\nSabina B. is married with three children who are 3 months, 6 years old and 12 years old.  She has a business, working as a weaver of alpaca wool.  Sabina makes caps, shawls and socks.  Now she buys more wool for the orders she receives from small businesses in her town.  In the village bank, she feels like she is with family.  She likes the bank because they concern themselves about how she is doing.  She follows the rules closely, has learned how to save and has many friends.  Her dream is to have her own store, full of merchandise.\r\n<p>\r\nSonia C. is married and has 3 children who are 5, 9 and 12 years old.  She crochets and knits, making pompom decorations for belts and skirts.  She has learned how to save and be a participatory leader.  She loves the bank very much.  She is going to invest the loan that FINCA gave her in the purchase of more bundles of wool.  She plans to make 30 pompoms a day and 900 per month.  Her dream is to buy sewing machines and two mending machines.  She will work until her dream comes true.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Priya Bapat, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2125,"image":{"id":222026,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Knitting","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"El Bancomunal Santa Lucia requests a loan of $2125 so the 11 partners can invest in their businesses","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Huancavelica","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.766667 -74.983333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":70,"posted_date":"2008-11-18T06:30:24Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2125,"lender_count":26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sabina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sonia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Isidora","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juliana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Valentina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nelitina Gladys","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Celestina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Paulina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sonia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alejandra","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-10-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":6500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":2125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":1083.33},{"due_date":"2008-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":1083.33},{"due_date":"2009-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":1083.33},{"due_date":"2009-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":1083.33},{"due_date":"2009-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":1083.33},{"due_date":"2009-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1083.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":354.17},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":354.17},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":354.17},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":354.17},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":354.17},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":354.15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":354.17,"local_amount":1083.33,"processed_date":"2008-11-26T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-16T04:12:13Z","rounded_local_amount":1095.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5314880},{"amount":354.28,"local_amount":1083.67,"processed_date":"2008-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-15T20:48:51Z","rounded_local_amount":1096.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9932607},{"amount":354.05,"local_amount":1082.99,"processed_date":"2009-01-25T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T12:12:24Z","rounded_local_amount":1095.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":10214903},{"amount":354.17,"local_amount":1083.33,"processed_date":"2009-02-24T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T08:26:42Z","rounded_local_amount":1095.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20396633},{"amount":354.17,"local_amount":1083.33,"processed_date":"2009-03-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T18:15:08Z","rounded_local_amount":1095.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27088409},{"amount":354.16,"local_amount":1083.35,"processed_date":"2009-04-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T16:08:07Z","rounded_local_amount":1095.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35981881}],"funded_date":"2008-11-18T14:15:49Z","paid_date":"2009-05-15T16:08:07Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Priya Bapat","image":null}},{"id":77150,"name":"Juanita","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Juanita, socia del Banco Comunal \u201cLa Mujer Riojana\u201d, vive en el departamento de San Mart\u00edn, provincia y distrito de Rioja.

She has been happy with her life since she married Francisco, despite the poor kind of living they had then. Fely and her husband lack the education that is required to be employed. Therefore, they have used their own skills to earn money for their children and to survive. \r\n\r\nFrancisco is a farmer who doesn't have his own land to farm. Other people in their village hire him during the rice planting and harvest season. His service fee is not enough to meet the expenses of his five children. In addition to being a mother, Fely had the courage to start her own small business to augment her husband's income. She has the skill to raise livestock in their wide and verdant backyard. However, because her business income was not enough to meet her family's expenses, she could not use it as business capital and there was no microfinance institution in their village that would trust her with a loan.\r\n\r\nIn 2005, Fely joined a group of poor women who share the same aspiration in life -- to bring their families out of poverty. With other four women, she received a loan from ASHI. From then on, Fely's business had direction and was sustained. After a series of loans from ASHI, she noticed improvements in her family's life. With her previous loan, she bought a calf and two piglets. Those piglets are already sold, and she now wants to buy more piglets to replace them, so she is applying for another loan. \r\n\r\nFely has never wanted anything else in her life as a mother other than to give her children a better future by sending them to school through college. However, she failed with her four eldest children, because some of them married at an early age and others stopped going to school and worked instead. Fely's last hope is youngest child who is in the third year of high school and will soon be in college, and, also, her grandchildren.

She has been engaged in this activity for eight years and enjoys most taking care of her fields.

This capital will allow us to buy raw materials in necessary quantity which we will dye and put up for sale in reception centers in our Department and other villages in Senegal. The most positive part is that the interest these young girls are taking in this aspect of production, which until now was done abroad, will make our work sustainable. To all the benefits, training will be added, and all thanks to Kiva. Now the young village girls and women know that they can make it with a common project and little good will. \r\n<p> <b>Translated from French by Liana Bianchi, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nNous avions d\u00e9j\u00e0 b\u00e9n\u00e9fici\u00e9 d'un premier pr\u00eat qui nous a mis sur la bonne voie pour l'ind\u00e9pendance \r\n\r\nfinanci\u00e8re et nous esp\u00e8rons qu'avec ce renouvellement faire la m\u00eame activit\u00e9 en y ajoutant la formation des \r\n\r\njeunes filles du village qui commence \u00e0 s'int\u00e9resser aux activit\u00e9s que nous sommes entrain de mener dans \r\n\r\nnotre \u00e9covillage.

After marriage, her husband and she mainly focused on farming and raising livestock. In 2003, she joined the TYM Fund. Initially, she borrowed money to invest in raising livestock but the profit was not substantial. As an active and creative woman, she decided to use the subsequent loan to invest in a general store. She was willing to learn and obtain experiences in doing business so her general store has been expanding ever since. Currently, her general store has a wide range of goods, bringing her a stable source of income. Her monthly income of 3,000,000VND (about 200USD) allows her to improve her family's standard of living and take care of her children. This time, she would like to borrow 900USD to continue investing in her general store.\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Vietnamese by Pham Yen Thanh, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nCh\u1ecb D. n\u0103m nay 31 tu\u1ed5i, gia \u0111\u00ecnh ch\u1ecb c\u00f3 2 con \u0111ang tu\u1ed5i \u0111i h\u1ecdc.

This is 46-year-old Hawa from Dar es Salaam. She is a  widow with five children between the ages of 18 and 27 years. Hawa has been running a kuku or poultry business since 2006. Raising kuku is a popular micro-business in Tanzania, especially amongst SELFINA clients. Kuku means chickens in Swahili, and raising them for sale is popular for a number of reasons. First, they require little start-up capital: you can start with one or two, and either add to them as you go, or wait for them to multiply naturally! They also require little space; sometimes you can just let them run around in your garden or compound. While they are growing they produce eggs, which can either be sold to provide a supplementary source of income or eaten to provide a supplementary source of protein. Hawa's business is doing well. She works at the business for twelve hours per day, seven days per week and is assisted by one employee. Hawa currently earns about 500 USD from her business. She is requesting a loan of 675 USD in order to purchase more chicks. In the future, she plans to renovate the kuku house and establish a clothes business where she can sell women clothes. Hawa thanks you for your support!\r\n<P>\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit through micro-leasing in Tanzania. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women and uses the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets; thus they are deemed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro-leasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":212238,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To purchase more chicks","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Dar es Salaam","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-6.8 39.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-10-17T00:00:19Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":675,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hawa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-10-31T06:46:48Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":800000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":80000},{"due_date":"2008-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":80000},{"due_date":"2009-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":80000},{"due_date":"2009-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":80000},{"due_date":"2009-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":80000},{"due_date":"2009-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":80000},{"due_date":"2009-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":80000},{"due_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":80000},{"due_date":"2009-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":80000},{"due_date":"2009-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":80000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":67.5},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":67.5},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":67.5},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":67.5},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":67.5},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.5},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.5},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.5},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.5},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":67.5,"local_amount":80000,"processed_date":"2008-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T04:22:01Z","rounded_local_amount":80325,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5348055},{"amount":67.5,"local_amount":80000,"processed_date":"2008-12-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-17T09:15:10Z","rounded_local_amount":80325,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9970638},{"amount":67.5,"local_amount":80000,"processed_date":"2009-01-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:17:05Z","rounded_local_amount":80325,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14886855},{"amount":67.5,"local_amount":80000,"processed_date":"2009-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:04:53Z","rounded_local_amount":80325,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20436115},{"amount":67.5,"local_amount":80000,"processed_date":"2009-03-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:57:37Z","rounded_local_amount":80325,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130388},{"amount":67.5,"local_amount":80000,"processed_date":"2009-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:27:13Z","rounded_local_amount":80325,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027196},{"amount":67.5,"local_amount":80000,"processed_date":"2009-05-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:15:55Z","rounded_local_amount":80325,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613236},{"amount":67.5,"local_amount":80000,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:03:57Z","rounded_local_amount":80325,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010319},{"amount":67.5,"local_amount":80000,"processed_date":"2009-07-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:41:50Z","rounded_local_amount":80325,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63232630},{"amount":67.5,"local_amount":80000,"processed_date":"2009-08-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:55:51Z","rounded_local_amount":80325,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73664446}],"funded_date":"2008-10-17T06:46:48Z","paid_date":"2009-09-15T21:55:51Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jason Groce","image":null}},{"id":73070,"name":"Nisida Aurora","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Nisida pertenece al Banco Comunal \u201cMujeres Perseverantes\u201d, ubicado en la Carretera Antigua de Yarinacocha N\u00ba 290, distrito de Yarinacocha, provincia de Coronel Portillo, departamento de Ucayali.

She currently has a loyal clientele who come to her place daily to buy, and she personally attends to them with her characteristic charisma.  With this loan of S\/. 1,700.00, she will buy all kinds of items such as plastic toys for children, and cosmetics such as colognes, creams, lipstick, and different brands of nail polish.

That s why in 1993, Busada began to engage in stock-breeding by buying milk cows. Also, she started to cultivate a plot of land with kidney-beans and perennial herbs, which serve as concentration of forage for her cattle and ensure a high quality of milk. \r\n\r\nBusada plans to use this loan of 80,000 KGS to buy four milk cows, which will lead to an increase of milk sales, and to purchase mineral fertilizers for her plot of land.

Normally those \"colmado\"s are in the neighborhood, a short walking distance from any home. Lucia will use the profits to have a better life, after she can finish building her house, and could have a successful business and good savings.\r\n\r\nThis Esperanza associate's story is representative of her group and of Esperanza's Haitian and Dominican  clients generally (many of whom recently emigrated to the DR from Haiti). Her group is located in Puerto Plata, a port town on the north coast where the economy depends on tourism. This area, like nearly all impoverished areas of the Dominican Republic, suffers from unreliable running water (none of which is potable) and electricity.

","en":"Margarita lives with her husband and with their 3 children between the ages of 29 and 34 years. They live in the city of Cartagena where she is the owner of a general store. She also provides telecommunications services. Her experience small business dates back 15 years when she started out selling casual clothing crafted by a friend. She gradually built a clientele that was increasingly demanding. With her saving she decided to import a variety of clothing and shoes from the cities of Medellin (department of Antioquia) and Bucaramanga (department of Santander), and it has done very well. With those savings she stabilized her business by installing a store in her house and later she gradually included a new service to her business, telecommunications. These businesses have been important in the maintenance of their home. Her greatest challenge is an insufficient working capital to meet client demand and this is the reason why she requests a Kiva loan. With her loan she will purchase office supplies and accessories to stock her display cases with high selling merchandise. A purchase in larger volumes compared to what she usually works with will help her attain special discounts and opportunities to increase her sales volumes. It will also give her experience in managing her investment which increases her potential for success.

In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a PHP 5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. She also sells Balut (Duck egg) and fish balls for additional income. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 500 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 28,000 loan. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, beverages and other products to add to her inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nOliva hopes to be able to expand soon, just as she dreams of being able to give her family a good future through all her hard work in her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay Micro Finance

D. is a citizen of the Shahrinav area. He lives with his family, is married and has 4 children. He works as a veterinarian, but also is engaged in a small business. In his home he has opened a small shop where he trades food and economic goods. He has been engaged in this kind of business for 14 years. Currently he wishes to increase his assortment by increasing his commodity circulation. However this can only be achieved by receiving a loan, and that is why he has asked Kiva for help. He wants to receive a loan in the amount of 2500 somoni and plans to repay the loan within 15 months. He lives in a secluded area, therefore by increasing his business he can help the people of his region.<p><b>Translated from Russian by Maria Lyuksyutova, Kiva

That will help his family to generate additional income.  \r\n\r\nWe appreciate your support for Don Sixto's projects.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Scott Crandall, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":212264,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Purchase one more cow in order to make cheese","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2008-10-20T20:30:14Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sixto","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-11-03T22:47:02Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2009-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2009-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2009-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2009-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2009-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":166.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.35}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":58.33,"local_amount":166.67,"processed_date":"2008-12-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T01:14:25Z","rounded_local_amount":176.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9957299},{"amount":58.33,"local_amount":166.67,"processed_date":"2009-01-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T14:01:13Z","rounded_local_amount":176.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":10227549},{"amount":58.33,"local_amount":166.67,"processed_date":"2009-02-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T20:01:47Z","rounded_local_amount":176.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20422784},{"amount":58.33,"local_amount":166.67,"processed_date":"2009-03-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:31:54Z","rounded_local_amount":176.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27116007},{"amount":58.33,"local_amount":166.67,"processed_date":"2009-04-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:40:34Z","rounded_local_amount":176.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36010968},{"amount":58.35,"local_amount":166.65,"processed_date":"2009-05-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T00:53:53Z","rounded_local_amount":176.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44594632}],"funded_date":"2008-10-20T21:47:02Z","paid_date":"2009-06-16T00:53:53Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Scott Crandall","image":163705}},{"id":73086,"name":"Chanthol","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Chanthol K. was born in 1978 and now she lives in Ang Tanuo village in Takeo Province.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93 percent of the country is mountainous and only 7 percent of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients have a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Abduahad is 31 years old and married with two children.\r\n<p>\r\nFor six years Abduahad has been involved in the business of repairing vehicles. He started as a mechanic and gradually managed to open his own repair shop. Abduahad is well-known in his neighborhood as an excellent mechanic. He tries to fix any problem and the prices for his services are quite fair which attract lots of clients. All this allows Abduahad to generate a stable income for his family and to educate his children.\r\n<p>\r\nToday Abduahad requests $1000 to purchase spare parts for repairing cars. He plans to repay the loan in 12 months and thanks everyone for support.\r\n<p><br>\r\n<b>More about Tajikistan and IMON International<\/b><br>\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and for it\u2019s famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets such as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after Tajikistan\u2019s independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n<p>\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b><br>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

These three children are still in school and help him with his store.\r\n\r\nNazrullo has thirteen years experience with his business selling groceries. With his small savings and on his own initiative, he decided to set up the store nine years ago. He thought about it because there wasn\u2019t this type of business in his neighborhood.\r\n\r\nThanks to the store, Nazrullo was able to buy a small used car which he uses to do deliveries in the mornings from time to time. His wife doesn\u2019t work and when Nazrullo needs to go out she is in charge of selling the groceries. Nazrullo works everyday of the week from 6 a.m. to 10 p.m. This hardworking father is motivated by his great love for his family.\r\n\r\nThis is the third time Nazrullo has requested a loan from IMON International and he has proven to be responsible with his repayments in the past. He wants to use the loan to invest in his store. He is sincerely grateful for your support.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>More about Tajikistan and IMON International<\/b>\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

Banzragch is 61 years old and lives with his wife and son in Ulaanbaatar, the largest city and capital of Mongolia. His son is 21 years old and currently attends university in the city. His wife helps out with managing the family business. Banzragch operates a small grocery shop in his town. He started his business in 2004 with capital of 400,000 tugrugs (~280 USD) after receving a loan from Xacbank, Kiva's Mongolian partner MFI.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  Today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n\r\nTajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged an already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still lives in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.
