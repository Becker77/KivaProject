They are building their own house to give their daughter a better standard of living.  Ever since she has taken on the responsibility of wife and mother, she has looked for ways to generate more income.  Thanks to the support of her sister, she started with cosmetic sales 5 years ago.  First she helped with the sales but little by little she became independent thanks to the large number of customers she had made.  Now she has gone into partnership with her sister.  They make hand-made necklaces at home to later sell at the district fairs.  At the same time they teach jewelry making in some schools.  Ana is very happy since she is gifted at teaching.  In the same way, she tries to turn every social setting into an opportunity to look for people who could turn into potential customers for her business.

He started his business in 1992 and after several years in business, he was able to afford to buy a larger, more reliable automobile. But the van he has purchased was a disadvantageous one that  requires too much petrol which has made it hard for him to manage his business successfully and make a profit. \r\n\r\nDosbol is still operating his transportation business  but supplements his  service earnings by transporting raw materials such as sheepskins, goat skins and wool and coal from the countryside to the province center. He works very hard to provide for his family. He says, \u201cMy only wish is to support my children's education and have them become good people.\u201d \r\n\r\nDosbol is requesting a 2,000,000 MNT loan to purchase tires for his automobile and a large amount of coal for his business.

The business started years ago when, due to an increase in family expenditures, mainly because of the children\u2019s education and other household difficulties.  This small business owner got a small loan from a family member, traveled to Cartagena, the most important tourist city in Colombia, and bought some products that she brought to her hometown.\r\n\r\nShe had total sales success.  She sold the merchandise to neighbors, friends, family and those that were referred to her.  She required a down payment and gave them up to 45 days to pay off the balance.  Clientele and orders began to increase.  With satisfaction, Betty says that today she helps her husband with family costs, without neglecting her duties as mother and wife because her business does not take up all of her time.  Her profit margin from this activity is 38%, on average.\r\n\r\nThis is Betty's first loan with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, to be invested in the purchase of clothes for men, women, and children and for footwear, perfume and women\u2019s accessories.  Because it is close to the December season, orders have increased substantially.  As time passes, this micro-entrepreneur has been able to establish a good client base and has separated from those that are delinquent.  In the not so distant future, she dreams of opening a store where she can offer all of her products and more comfortably attend to all that visit.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":643000,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Products

She earns her living by operating three business ventures: a sari-sari store, electronic reloading and a food vending business. Her husband Carlito, who is 49 years old, works as an electrician and plumber to earn his living. She has five children who are between 20 and 28 years old. Susan joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2000 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 15 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Susan has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 20,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 6,000, uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her 16th loan, she is borrowing PHP 21,000 to use as funds for her business operations so that she can continue to save up for future household expenses and savings. Susan is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She is married and has 6 children between 21 and 36 years old. The two youngest, who live with her, still go to school. Alda finished 6th grade in the old educational system and did not continue because of financial difficulties. She lives in her own house and supports a grandson and a nephew who live with her.\n\nShe left Inharrime to move to Maputo with her family when she was still a child. Now she has a farm of about 2 hectares where she has been growing vegetables with the help of one employee for more than 10 years. Through this work she earns about 3,000 meticais per month, which she uses for household expenses.\n\nAlda has never had loans from other banks. She learned about Hluvuku through coworkers who are customers of this institution. This is Alda's fourth loan with Hluvuku, and she is asking for 20,000 meticais to buy farm supplies (seeds, fertilizer, compost, and increase her area of production) to increase the amount she grows. The earlier loans for 8,500.00 meticais,10,000.00 meticais and 15,000.00 meticais were for agribusiness.\n\nShe promises to pay off her loan on time so she can have other loans in the future. Alda intends to ask for more loans both to increase her farmland and to try to start some construction work.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":779247,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farm

She is 31 years old, married and the mother of 3 children and one stepson who are 14, 12, 5 and 2 years old. The two oldest are in school. She only went to school until the 6th grade due to her parents lack of financial resources. She owns the house where she lives with her family and does not support anyone else.\r\n<p>\r\nShe left the Chokwe District to go to Matola with her parents due to the destabilization war of 1983. In 1999, she left with her parents to Boane in order to establish the home where they now live. She has had her own business for over 20 years. She learned the businees from her mother in Matola when she was 10 years old. She works around 10 hours a day. She has no employees and makes around 7.000.00mt a month which goes towards house expenses and savings. \r\n<p>\r\nShe has never had loans from other banks. She came to know Hluvuku through community leadership during mobilization meetings. This loan, in the amount of 8.000.00mt, is her fourth. She intends to purchase supplies (beans, eggs, flour and others) to increase her inventory. The previous loans were for 5.000.00mt, 8.000.00mt and 11.000.00mt and were used in housing and her business. \r\n<p>\r\nIn the future, she would like to request more loans to finish her construction and offer better living conditions to her family.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Betyna Almeida-Covarrubias, Kiva

Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement.

It was the site of a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, Western culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n\t\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after it gained its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History \r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

They know the variety of merchandise that she has in her store and don't hesitate to buy from her, since they have the security of knowing they'll find what they need. \r\n\r\nWhat she likes most about her work is selling and talking with her customers. She has been in this business for 20 years and considers the toughest part to be getting up early to open her store, but even so she knows that it's her job and she has to do it. She hopes that in the future her business will grow and bring in more income; for this reason she hopes that the loan will help to solidify her plans. \r\n\r\nThis will be her 12th loan with MFP and she has always proven to be punctual in making her payments and expects she will be now, too. In her village bank she is very dear to the rest of her members because she is very responsible. With the 2,000 nuevos soles that she requested, she will buy more products to better stock her grocery store.

He opted for commerce in clothing, more precisely in second-hand clothing, a business he learned from his father, who is an elderly vendor in the city.  He has been in this business for over 30 years and is much in demand by his customers for the quality of his goods \r\n\r\nTo satisfy his burgeoning customer base, Drissa decided to join the microfinance institution Soro Yiriwaso two years ago.  He is on his second individual loan.  His preceding loan was repaid ahead of schedule.  With this loan, he intends to buy a ball of jerseys and one and a half balls of shoes.  The clothing is purchased locally from city wholesalers and is resold at the retail level, cash or credit accepted, to customers composed of women and men. \r\n\r\nWith this loan, he envisions realizing a monthly profit of 100,000 francs CFA that will be used essentially to augment his working capital, to help with family expenses, to make loan interest payments, and to invest the rest in his business. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":322181,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Used Clothing","sector":"Clothing","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"To buy second-hand clothing","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sikasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.316667 -5.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:24Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":525,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Drissa","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-05-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":250000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2010-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":83333.34}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":175,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-08-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T22:43:56Z","rounded_local_amount":84721.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73678841},{"amount":175,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-11-11T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:56:43Z","rounded_local_amount":84721.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103873541},{"amount":175,"local_amount":83333.34,"processed_date":"2010-02-09T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T11:18:38Z","rounded_local_amount":84721.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123991011}],"funded_date":"2009-06-16T19:30:16Z","paid_date":"2010-03-15T11:18:38Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Daniel Kuey","image":669418}},{"id":113690,"name":"Lilia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lilia L. is from the town of Polanco, Zamboanga del Norte.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The store is home to Crafts Corner, one entity of the store where Delia creates handmade items such as headbands for babies and children, decorated knit hats and other accessories. She uses her time wisely and works on these crafts while business is slow in the mornings. During heavy business times, she uses these crafts to ease customers into conversation; thereafter she educates them about the other half of her business where she sells reshaping garments, created by a family-owned business and orthopedists to improve people\u2019s back, posture and help lose weight. She also sells various natural ingredient cleansers. \r\n\r\nDelia works in a separate part of Wonderland of the Americas Mall similar to an indoor flea market where she is in competition with major businesses. The section of the mall is closed Monday and Tuesday so, in July 2011, she started to sell her crafts at stores to market her business. She said she has to work other venues on her days off for additional income. In the past, Delia has worked as an independent agent of Mary Kay but has never sold as much product as she does now. It has always been a passion for Delia to own her own store, she said. Though she does craft shows, she feels that owning a storefront makes her business more credible. \r\n\r\nShe initially entered the profession to educate people about health. Delia said some people are possibly not taught but, \u201cWhen we\u2019re younger, we don\u2019t pay too much attention to what\u2019s important such as which nutritional products are good for you and important.\u201d As part of a solution, she came up with the idea for her store. Most recently, she employs herself, but as a part of the multi-level business with Ayrss\u2019 reshaping garment, she sometimes has multiple people in her store to help talk about the product and conduct fittings. \r\n\r\nDelia will use the loan to purchase more products and supplies. She said this will help her generate more business as she\u2019s also been looking for two mobile carrying cases: one to showcase her crafts, the other for the nutritional products and reshaping garments as often as she can. The ones she is interested in are five feet tall and have wheels. Without the loan, she feels she would not be able to enjoy the convenience of going out as much as she does to sell her crafts. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2150,"image":{"id":967320,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Health","sector":"Health","themes":null,"use":"To pay for more health products and supplies.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"US","country":"United States","town":"San Antonio, Texas","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39.76 -98.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":173,"posted_date":"2011-12-29T19:20:22Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2150,"lender_count":73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Delia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-12-06T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":2140,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":2150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":151.14},{"due_date":"2012-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":167.2},{"due_date":"2012-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":171.54},{"due_date":"2012-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":172.36},{"due_date":"2012-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":175.72},{"due_date":"2012-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":177.67},{"due_date":"2012-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":180.93},{"due_date":"2012-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":183.14},{"due_date":"2012-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":185.93},{"due_date":"2012-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":189.04},{"due_date":"2012-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":191.65},{"due_date":"2012-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":193.68}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":151.85},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":167.98},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":172.34},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":173.16},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":176.55},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":178.5},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":181.77},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":184},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":186.8},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":189.92},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":192.54},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":194.59}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":151.85,"local_amount":151.14,"processed_date":"2012-01-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T09:11:48Z","rounded_local_amount":151.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257101382},{"amount":167.98,"local_amount":167.2,"processed_date":"2012-02-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T08:08:40Z","rounded_local_amount":167.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263226493},{"amount":325.75,"local_amount":324.23,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-16T07:53:59Z","rounded_local_amount":325.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283412429},{"amount":556.57,"local_amount":553.99,"processed_date":"2012-07-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-16T08:13:47Z","rounded_local_amount":556.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294508071},{"amount":184,"local_amount":183.14,"processed_date":"2012-08-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T08:45:58Z","rounded_local_amount":184,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301315555},{"amount":376.72,"local_amount":374.97,"processed_date":"2012-10-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T10:49:23Z","rounded_local_amount":376.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315305831},{"amount":192.54,"local_amount":191.65,"processed_date":"2012-11-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T11:11:03Z","rounded_local_amount":192.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322914515},{"amount":194.59,"local_amount":193.68,"processed_date":"2012-12-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-18T09:54:18Z","rounded_local_amount":194.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331745342}],"funded_date":"2011-12-29T23:03:43Z","paid_date":"2013-01-18T09:54:18Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":380916,"name":"Ana Lilian","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Ana tiene 28 a\u00f1os de edad, vive con su compa\u00f1ero de vida.\n\nElla tiene 8 a\u00f1os de administrar su propio negocio de sala de belleza.

She is applying for a loan to buy more seasonal fruits for her son so that he is able to expand his business and earns good profits.<p>\r\nShe is joined in her loan group by a few more members. Rukhsana baji wants a loan to buy marbles for her marble selling business. Kaneez baji and Sharifan baji each want a loan to buy more shoes for their shoe selling businesses. Zahida baji wants a loan to buy iron to resell. Ghulam Fatima baji wants a loan to buy ingredients (lentils, cooking oil and spices) for her food business. <p>\r\nThis is a group loan. The loan funds will be distributed among the group members, each of whom will invest in her own business. The members mutually guarantee one another's loans. If one member does not repay, the other members are responsible."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1300,"image":{"id":220781,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits &

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is a hardworking lady. \r\n<p>\r\nFlavia makes chicken feed from fresh animal blood, shells and bones. She employs people to go to Lufula slaughterhouses to collect the fresh blood in cans. She boils this with ingredients from Ugachick Poultry Breeders Limited in Gayaza, as an independent producer. Once done, she sells to Ugachick itself, although the payments take two weeks to come through. This is one reason she also sells to other firms that pay instant cash for her to remain in business. \r\n<p>\r\n Her previous loan helped her renovate her recently built house and now she needs a loan to help buy more raw materials for her business. She also wants to put a concrete floor in her house to get rid of the dust. She is very grateful for her previous loans and those to come.

They sell their retail ware at the Bougoula Heamu market and through home sales; they take cash or credit payments from a customer base of men and women. \r\nThe women envisage making an average monthly profit of 32.500 FCFA each, a part of which would be used for savings and their families' needs, and the rest would be reinvested in business activities. \r\nThey hope to maintain their collaboration with Soro Yiriwaso and its partner Kiva in order to improve their living conditions.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Danielle Treharne, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":440544,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"To purchase various items.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sikasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.316667 -5.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2009-12-05T15:40:12Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1050,"lender_count":30,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Awa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bintou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Barakissa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatoumata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sanata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fanta ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-11-18T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":450000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":75000},{"due_date":"2010-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":75000},{"due_date":"2010-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":75000},{"due_date":"2010-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":75000},{"due_date":"2010-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":75000},{"due_date":"2010-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":75000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":175,"local_amount":75000,"processed_date":"2009-12-18T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T17:05:39Z","rounded_local_amount":76050.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110763606},{"amount":175,"local_amount":75000,"processed_date":"2010-01-18T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-21T08:49:54Z","rounded_local_amount":76050.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118152440},{"amount":175,"local_amount":75000,"processed_date":"2010-02-18T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-18T08:48:55Z","rounded_local_amount":76050.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123991282},{"amount":175,"local_amount":75000,"processed_date":"2010-03-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-18T08:32:39Z","rounded_local_amount":76050.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":129021552},{"amount":175,"local_amount":75000,"processed_date":"2010-04-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T12:15:22Z","rounded_local_amount":76050.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136746348},{"amount":175,"local_amount":75000,"processed_date":"2010-05-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T10:03:29Z","rounded_local_amount":76050.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144778893}],"funded_date":"2009-12-16T03:47:36Z","paid_date":"2010-06-15T10:03:29Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Danielle Treharne","image":null}},{"id":163130,"name":"Korb","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Korb N. lives in Rolus village in Takeo province.

Inici\u00f3 su actividad de vender almuerzos hace tres a\u00f1os; inicialmente elaboraba la comida en su casa vendi\u00e9ndola a sus vecinos, hasta que uno de ellos le comentara que donde \u00e9l trabajaba no hab\u00eda quien vendiera almuerzos; fue as\u00ed como Margarita se instal\u00f3 en la Zona Industrial de Mamonal, lugar cercano a Cartagena que concentra  muchas empresas importantes del pa\u00eds.

R. is a businesswoman from Cartagena who has ambitious goals for her food business; she hopes it will grow to such an extent that her products will be known city-wide and that, some day, she will be recognized as one of Colombia\u2019s greatest businesswomen.  \r\n\r\nShe started her business selling breakfasts three years ago.  Initially, she made the meals at home and sold them to her neighbors until one of them mentioned to her that where he worked there was no one selling meals.  This was how Margarita set herself up in the Mamonal Industrial Zone, a site near Cartagena that concentrates many of the country\u2019s important companies.  She borrowed money that had to be repaid the next day to buy raw materials and prepare the lunches.\r\n\r\nGradually, her customer base grew.  Since the business needed an injection of capital, she called upon Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, an organization to which she is grateful for giving her the opportunity to launch her business, to increase her income a bit, and to replace the money for that loan she needed to repay the next day.\r\n\r\nThis $2.000.000 loan is her second one and she will use it to buy ingredients for her meals as well as tables and chairs for her business.\r\n\r\nBecause the Fundaci\u00f3n has supported her both financially and personally, she feels very loyal to it.  Her previous loans helped her increase her profits and to expand her service area in her type of work with better quality service; she has two employees and she is happy because she is generating income in other homes like hers.\r\n\r\nMargarita considers her greatest challenge to be having to face life alone with her three children.  However, thanks to God she was able to overcome and today she is happy knowing that she is making the effort for her children to advance.  She has taught them that life isn\u2019t easy but that with effort, dedication and lots of love, one can reach one\u2019s goals.\r\n\r\nThis is her lesson.  It helps her to face difficulties as part of life and business.  For example, when sales are down and they barely produce sufficient income to meet basic needs of her family and her business, she forges ahead even if she has to delay reaching her dreams because she knows that the first priority must be to reinvest in her business so that she can be sure to provide for her family\u2019s support.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan,

They live together in a community located at the edge of the Peruvian jungle, where they have their own home.  Raul is a very demanding person.  Considering that he lived with little money and convinced his wife to increase the size of their farm land, since they worked in small parcels and the money they were making from the sale of their products was not enough.  Currently they produce a larger quantity of cacao and their profits have increased considerably.  He still feel that there are many things to be accomplished in this life, and for this reason he is planning to buy more farmland in the future from other producers, with the goal of planting other products such as coffee and citrus fruit.  He knows very well that he needs to move at a slow and secure pace, and works hard every day, takes good care of his crops so that they are not damaged by pests.  He works together with his wife for 10 hours of every day.  At planting and harvest times, he hires laborers to help him get his final product.  This is a second loan with MFP and he commits to pay his installments on time.  Also, he is eternally grateful to his community group for the organization and fellowship that they show in their team work.  Raul is planning to use the loan money to provide adequate maintenance to his fields by buying manure and fertilizer with the purpose of improving the quality of his products.    <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Laura Bobbit, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":539838,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":" Purchase of fertilizers and supplies for the care of his crops.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"CUSCO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.518333 -71.978056","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-05-14T06:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":725,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Raul ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-04-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":725}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":725,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T08:52:35Z","rounded_local_amount":2057.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195886416}],"funded_date":"2010-05-28T11:38:48Z","paid_date":"2011-03-24T08:52:35Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Laura Bobbit","image":null}},{"id":204696,"name":"God Is In Control Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Esther N., who is holding the sign, is the leader of a group of five borrowers called \"God Is In Control\".

C. is from the village of District 1. She is 41 years old. Salina is the group leader of a five-member group loan offered by ASKI.

The official name of this borrowing group is Salina D. C. group.\r\n\r\nSalina is married and has one adult child. To make a living, Salina owns and operates a specialized retail store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling daily use products such as shampoo, soap and toothpaste in the local community. Salina has been engaged in her business for more than five years and earns approximately 3,500 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Salina joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Salina has successfully repaid a previous loan of 8,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase new items to expand her product offering. Salina is requesting a new loan of 12,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the third loan taken out by Salina from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 38 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

They live in Melitopol, which is a small town with limited options for finding work.  This is why Victoria used an opportunity, which presented itself to her in 2002, to get involved in selling children's clothing at the town's central market.  Her retail outlet is known to regular customers because a wide assortment of merchandise at affordable prices can be found there.  Currently, Victoria's working capital is 12 000 hryvnia.  She wants to use a loan in the sum of 10 000 hryvnia to purchase a winter selection of children's clothing.  Considering that Victoria is a single mother and has no other means to make a living, this loan will be a good help for her business and family as a

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.<P>\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<P>\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

They all live in traditional extended families and average 44 years of age and 5 children each.  They all live in the Bamanan Kin district of Markala (fourth administrative region of the Republic of Mali). The group members do commerce in fruit, <i>pagnes<\/i> (colorful West African cloth), locally-made fruit juices, soap, kitchen utensils, etc. \r\n\r\nConcerned about augmenting their working capital, the women decided to collaborate with Soro Yiriwaso and are now on their fourth solidarity loan, after having repaid the preceding ones.  This loan will be used to buy 21 bolts of Wax <i>pagnes<\/i>, a 300-count sack of soap, a cart-load of mangoes, seven parcels of calabash bowls, and some ladles.  The women resupply themselves with Wax <i>pagnes<\/i> at the grand marketplace of Bamako; with mangoes and soaps at the Diamarabougou fair; and with bowls and ladles at the Tona fair.  The goods are resold to a mixed customer base, cash or credit accepted, in the districts of Markala going door-to-door, and at the fairs of Diamarabougou and Sibila. \r\n\r\nThe women hope to realize an average monthly profit of 46,000 francs CFA that will be used for food and for covering the children's schooling costs.  Their ambition is to save money and to become wholesalers selling soap and livestock feed.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":950,"image":{"id":322218,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"To buy various goods","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"S\u00e9gou","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:24Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":950,"lender_count":30,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sayon","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fanta                        ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dj\u00e9n\u00e9ba                      ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Diaratou                   ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Awa           ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mamou        ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-05-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":450000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":950,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":75000},{"due_date":"2009-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":75000},{"due_date":"2009-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":75000},{"due_date":"2009-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":75000},{"due_date":"2009-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":75000},{"due_date":"2009-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":75000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":158.33},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":158.33},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":158.33},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":158.33},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":158.33},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":158.35}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":158.33,"local_amount":75000,"processed_date":"2009-06-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:22:18Z","rounded_local_amount":76652.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53020274},{"amount":158.33,"local_amount":75000,"processed_date":"2009-07-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T19:19:52Z","rounded_local_amount":76652.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63243030},{"amount":158.33,"local_amount":75000,"processed_date":"2009-08-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T22:43:26Z","rounded_local_amount":76652.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73678850},{"amount":158.33,"local_amount":75000,"processed_date":"2009-09-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T03:56:11Z","rounded_local_amount":76652.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87112640},{"amount":158.33,"local_amount":75000,"processed_date":"2009-10-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T07:09:25Z","rounded_local_amount":76652.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97028207},{"amount":158.35,"local_amount":75000,"processed_date":"2009-11-08T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:56:29Z","rounded_local_amount":76652.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103873545}],"funded_date":"2009-06-11T20:51:47Z","paid_date":"2009-12-15T14:56:29Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Daniel Kuey","image":669418}},{"id":113722,"name":"Nh\u1eef Th\u1ecb Nguy\u1ec7t","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"N.

Nevertheless, because she is a very entrepreneurial woman, she has also been selling food (barbecued foods, kebabs, and other regional specialties) on Saturdays and Sundays for the past 3 years.\r\n\r\nWhat she likes best about her work is the feeling of being active, as well as the ability to be profitable because revenues are constant.  Before, she would have liked to have had a minimarket.  This is her 7th loan with MFP.  She is happy to be part of a communal bank because all her peers are nice and accomplished.  With the funds from this loan, she will refurbish her rented rooms to offer her tenants more comfortable conditions.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Julia Kastner, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":430653,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"Refurbishing rented rooms","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-11-19T19:40:18Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":700,"lender_count":27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marlene","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-10-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":299.27},{"due_date":"2009-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":318.56},{"due_date":"2010-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":322.95},{"due_date":"2010-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":338.19},{"due_date":"2010-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":355.11},{"due_date":"2010-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":365.92}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":104.74},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":111.5},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":113.03},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":118.37},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":124.29},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.07}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":104.74,"local_amount":299.27,"processed_date":"2009-11-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:55:54Z","rounded_local_amount":302.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103843219},{"amount":216.24,"local_amount":617.83,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-25T09:54:46Z","rounded_local_amount":623.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734811},{"amount":8.29,"local_amount":23.68,"processed_date":"2010-01-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:10:33Z","rounded_local_amount":23.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118124146},{"amount":118.37,"local_amount":338.19,"processed_date":"2010-02-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:49:10Z","rounded_local_amount":341.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123959875},{"amount":124.29,"local_amount":355.11,"processed_date":"2010-03-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:33:07Z","rounded_local_amount":358.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128992720},{"amount":128.07,"local_amount":365.92,"processed_date":"2010-04-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:37:48Z","rounded_local_amount":369.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136717504}],"funded_date":"2009-11-22T04:38:21Z","paid_date":"2010-05-15T11:37:48Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Julia Kastner","image":343837}},{"id":159000,"name":"Leoncie","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Leoncie is 38 years old, is married with four children, and she takes care of two dependents.

Fifty kilometers from the city are the ruins of Ingapirca, one of the most visited tourist sites for natives and foreigners in Ecuador. Azogues and Ca\u00f1ar are famous for its craftwork, especially for making straw hats and ceramic products. The people are cordial and very kind, including the community bank members who work hard every day to provide a better present and future to their family. Martha lives in the community of Zhizhiquin with her husband, who works at a sawmill they own, and their four children, ages 13, 11, 8 and 5, who are all in school. Together they have been able to build their own home through a lot of hard work and sacrifice. Martha has helped her husband at the sawmill for the past three years and also dedicates herself to household chores and caring for a cow they own.

It goes without saying that Farming, has from time in memorial, been the backbone of most business in Uganda. Many families subsisted on it to start other businesses, educate their children and to make ends meet. One individual who did not gloss over this reality is one high spirited 38 year married mother of 4, who goes by the name of A. Harriet.

For a person who describes herself as a hard worker, it is no surprise that her business has made progress through the course of the last 10 years. In a month, she has been making profits that have consistently totaled up to 600,000 shillings. Like any other business person who aims at making more profits, she is taking a long view with plans of transforming into a wholesale business.

She is a woman who is not afraid of the difficulties encountered along the way to her destiny.  She was able to raise her only daughter by herself.  She gave her daughter an education.  She separated from her live-in partner, and from that time on she has been in charge of her household.  She lives with her only daughter and her grandson in her own house.  Every day they share the desire and enthusiasm of getting ahead and having a better quality of life.\r\n\r\nJuana makes clothes.  She makes her own designs, and she makes clothes for her customers.  They always seek her out so that her magic hands will make their garments.  They have faith that she will do a very good job.  She has a small workshop in her house where she does all of her work.\r\n\r\nShe started her work 20 years ago.  She started making simple things.  With time and experience she decided to make more complicated things until she managed the good finishing touch that she now has.\r\n\r\nShe works alone, and she is more than happy to be doing what she likes.  Things are going very well for her.  She has a lot of customers who ask for her very often.  Also, when there are no customers she makes her designs.  That way she is able to sell in her free time.\r\n\r\nIn the beginning she felt of little use in her house.  She only waited for the money that her live-in partner earned from his work.  But, she decided to do something.  From then on she is more than happy to be able to do this work.  It has allowed her to live her life with a measure of comfort.  She now wishes to work more and more in order to be able to continue growing with this work.\r\n\r\nThis will be her first loan with MFP.  She is very happy to know that she will have financial support through the loan that she was granted.  This way she will be able to firm up some plans she has for her business.  She pledges to be a responsible member and to make her payments punctually.  She wants to work well with her communal bank, where there are good references about being supportive and punctual\r\n\r\nShe will use the requested 1,000 soles to buy materials to be able to continue with her work.  Among the things she will buy are fabric, needles, elastics, and patterns.  This way she will be able to sew in greater quantity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":940792,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cloth & Dressmaking

Her husband, retired for 15 years with a meager and irregular pension, does not contribute productively anymore to household expenses. Thus, to deal with school fees and the teaching of the children, Mrs. A., in addition to her principal business - the sale and storage of cereals (millets, corn, and beans) - has added the preparation of \u2019Tchoukoutou,\u2019 a millet-based drink which is very popular with the local population. However, her limited financial mans do not allow her to develop and enlarge her business. Still, she is a confident woman with a good sense of managing the gifts of others, which has translated into two previous loans of $350 and $650, repaid without any problems whatsoever. Seasoned and committed to her business, she deserves to be supported financially in her activities. \r\n\r\n<p>So, she is asking for a loan of $950 to obtain a stable stockpile of cereals and to resell these in times of scarcity.

Mrs. Yenny used to work as a housekeeper and it was there that she first saw that the woman she worked for brought clothes, sheets, quilts and other products from Oruro as her business. This sparked her interest in the business and, with the help of her employer, she began to drive her on the trips to distribute the products in the markets in Santa Cruz. Three years ago she became independent and brings all the before-mentioned products to her home, which she inherited, where she has a small building she and her husband worked to put up.  Six months ago her youngest child was born and, because of this, she stopped traveling and her resources have begun to decrease. The loan she would like to receive from this organization would be of much help to allow her to start traveling and begin to increase profits once again.  Lately she is buying very little merchandise, but here in Santa Cruz she could distribute it all at once to the businesses with encouraging profits.  Her dream is to be able to bring a lot of merchandise like her former employer did and, in this way, finish the construction of her home and buy her own vehicle.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from

(vendors) working in Thies, a city about 70km from Dakar.  The association, named after an important marabout (a religious leader in West African Islam), was founded in 2006 by a group of entrepreneurial women from the Cit\u00e9 Lamy neighborhood.  The aim was to help the members finance their small businesses through a revolving savings fund called a tontine, in which members contribute a small amount to the pot each month to finance one member's activities.  Today, the association has evolved to secure group loans for its members through cooperation with UIMCEC.  Groups of five are financed through 10-month loans in which each member receives an equal amount.  On the 20th of each month, the members of the association hold a meeting to collect the repayments.  Currently, there are 14 groups of women financed through UIMCEC.  Sope Serigne Babacar Sy is headed by Ms. CoumB. Faye, the president, and Ms. Oumu Ngom, the treasurer.  \n\nAwa B. heads group No. 3.  She has been selling perfumes and cosmetics for about four years.   Awa chose perfume sales as they sell quite quickly - currently, the Casablanca and Aqua de Gio scents are the best sellers, she says.  Awa is married and the mother of two children, aged 2 and 6.\n\nThe other groups members are: Mareme D., who sells detergents and soaps; Gnangna D. who has a small kiosk selling small items from perfumes to candies; Maimouna F. who has a small vegetable stall in the market of Grand Thies; and Aly T. who sells marmite cooking pots in the same market.  Each group member receives 100,000 FCFA in loan financing to bolster her respective activity.  This is the second loan for the group.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":466116,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Perfumes","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To
