The loan will be used to buy more cosmetic  body lotions and will help Monica to generate greater profits and pay school fees for herself. Monica hopes that in the future she will be able to become a doctor. \r\n\r\nMonica is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities and a forum for life-skills training.

Ibanda seem minimal. It takes lots of enterprise, conviction, and credible ideas outside of the conventional box. This reality dawned on Benard a decade ago as he set forth in the aforementioned trade. A steady and satisfactory trajectory has been formidable to sustain and consolidate, but, nevertheless, Benard has made inroads. His kind of business would do really well in a metropolis like Kampala or Jinja, but Benard is undeterred.\r\n\r\nHe has been able to get into the good graces of those he has served, and, as such, has carved out his own niche. His clientele base is not so big if parallels are drawn with other entrepreneurs engaged in the same trade in places like Mbarara--fast becoming Western Uganda's commercial city. That, however, does not unnerve him. He is upbeat about the future prospects of his business, and he believes this Kiva loan will come in handy in his drive to open new horizons for his trade.\r\n\r\nBenard, a lusty widower with four children, says he began his business with income from his crude alcohol sales business. Thus far, his business's sales returns total 500,000 Ugandan shillings. Benard also ekes out supplementary income from a modest food sales business.

Mary Prah, her mother, helps her because Jameratu had to go to the hospital for treatment for a minor illness (Mary is in the picture). \r\n<p>\r\nJameratu owns and operates a grocery shop in one of the busy local markets.

Samak\u00e9, age 37, is the father of three children and lives with his wife and children in a monogamous family in the Dougounina district of the city of Bougouni (third administrative region of the Republic of Mali).  Not having attended school, he soon began working to earn a living.  Before running a business buying and selling electronics that he learned from his brother, he was a village farmer for ten years.  With three years of experience, he has a good command of his commercial business and is well-known by his customers, who are growing in number. \r\n\r\nIn his search for supplemental financial resources, he decided to join Soro Yiriwaso and is on his first individual loan for buying electronics (lamps, flashlights, radios...)  Supplies are gotten from wholesalers in Bamako (capital of Mali), and sales are made locally in Bougouni to customers composed of local people and fair vendors from surrounding villages. \r\n\r\nWith this loan, he intends to realize a monthly profit of 30,000 francs CFA that will be used to make loan interest payments and to provide for his family.  In the years to come, he envisions expanding his shop.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":322949,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Electronics Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"To buy electronic goods","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Bougouni","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.416667 -7.483333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:25Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":625,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Saibou","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-05-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":300000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2009-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2009-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2009-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2009-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2009-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2009-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2010-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2010-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":33333.36}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.44},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.44},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.44},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.44},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":69.44},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":69.44},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":69.44},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":69.44},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.48}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":69.44,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2009-06-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:23:02Z","rounded_local_amount":33390.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53020279},{"amount":69.44,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2009-07-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T19:20:27Z","rounded_local_amount":33390.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63243035},{"amount":69.44,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2009-08-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T22:43:55Z","rounded_local_amount":33390.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73678860},{"amount":69.44,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2009-09-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T03:56:49Z","rounded_local_amount":33390.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87112645},{"amount":69.44,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2009-10-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T07:10:00Z","rounded_local_amount":33390.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97028212},{"amount":69.44,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2009-11-11T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:56:46Z","rounded_local_amount":33390.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103873549},{"amount":69.44,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2009-12-11T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T17:03:53Z","rounded_local_amount":33390.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110763288},{"amount":69.44,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2010-01-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:36:13Z","rounded_local_amount":33390.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118152091},{"amount":69.48,"local_amount":33333.36,"processed_date":"2010-02-09T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T11:18:38Z","rounded_local_amount":33390.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123991016}],"funded_date":"2009-06-17T12:55:32Z","paid_date":"2010-03-15T11:18:38Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Daniel Kuey","image":669418}},{"id":114142,"name":"\u0110\u1eb7ng's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"\"\u0110\u1eb7ng Th\u1ecb T.

She is very optimistic that her business will grow and wishes to earn a better income for her family.\r\n\r\nMarilou said that she likes the services of CEVI because they give the lowest interest rate, which is 2% a month and is very affordable to repay.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":383001,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy piglets and pig feed","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Surallah, South Cotabato","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"6.366667 124.733333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":125,"posted_date":"2009-09-05T15:10:11Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":175,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marilou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-08-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":8000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":8000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":175}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":175,"local_amount":8000,"processed_date":"2010-01-21T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:09:25Z","rounded_local_amount":8524.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118059934}],"funded_date":"2009-09-05T18:37:45Z","paid_date":"2010-02-15T11:09:25Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jeff Avery","image":233371}},{"id":138771,"name":"Chantal","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Chantal U. is 46 years old, is married with five children, and she takes care of eight dependents.\r\n\r\nChantal has been in the business of selling clothes for fiive years, working ten hours a day, but her monthly earnings are still low.

M. is thirty years old, married, and has two sons aged nine years old and four years old. His business is located in Thika town. Thika is the region in Kenya known for its production of pineapples. He has been selling fruit such as bananas, water melon, oranges, apples, mangoes, avocados, paw paws and pineapples for the last three years to the local people. He also supplies fruits to other fruit vendors in the area. \r\n\r\nBenson says that this business is profitable and the major challenge he has is that there are other people in the area doing the same business as his and so customers are not very loyal as they are spoilt for choice. However he works very hard to keep his business doing well. He is using his loan of Kes 80,000 to buy more fruits to expand his business. He hopes to expand his business to wholesale, open up a food processing plant and become the manager. He describes himself as charismatic, hard-working and

She lives with her husband and two children in their own house. For more than twenty years, she has been producing artisan embroideries and items of clothing typical to the area. From the comfort of her own home, she splits her time between carrying out the domestic tasks and spending time on this artisan craft. During the festive seasons, between June and July, the demand for these embroideries increases, along with her income. She enjoys her work very much; for her it is a hobby and allows her to demonstrate her ability to make good use of colours in her embroideries. She therefore does not intend to stop working and wants to progress further and further with her business. This is her ninth loan with MFP, and she is very happy to know that she has a means of financial support as she has always proved to be responsible with her payments. She is also grateful to be part of her communal group because all of its members are responsible and supportive people. She will invest the loan requested in the purchase of materials such as threads and fabrics to continue her embroidery.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Kate Stansfield, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":565623,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Embroidery","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"To buy fabrics and threads.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"HUANCAYO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.066667 -75.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-07-10T14:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Yudy ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-06-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":218.67},{"due_date":"2010-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":233.44},{"due_date":"2010-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":244.31},{"due_date":"2010-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":256.9},{"due_date":"2010-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":267.62},{"due_date":"2010-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":279.06}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.18},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.59},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.58},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":94.2},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":98.13},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":102.32}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":80.18,"local_amount":218.67,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:37:15Z","rounded_local_amount":226.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159673554},{"amount":85.59,"local_amount":233.44,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:39:54Z","rounded_local_amount":241.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166887373},{"amount":89.58,"local_amount":244.31,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:25:36Z","rounded_local_amount":252.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172154384},{"amount":94.2,"local_amount":256.9,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T15:13:57Z","rounded_local_amount":265.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177449679},{"amount":98.13,"local_amount":267.62,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:00:27Z","rounded_local_amount":277.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182588388},{"amount":102.32,"local_amount":279.06,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T14:03:38Z","rounded_local_amount":288.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188724874}],"funded_date":"2010-07-10T16:55:11Z","paid_date":"2011-01-15T14:03:38Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kate Stansfield","image":null}},{"id":217422,"name":"Luz","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Luz joined ASHI in 2005; aiming to get out of the spiral of poverty, and consistently acquire working capital for her \"sari-sari\" (variety) store and food vending ventures.

He started this business 7 years ago with a small number of livestock. But as his business has developed, he has acquired greater quantities of animals for their eventual sale and gain from their derivatives. According to Muminjon, he works very hard so that he can support his children. For that reason, he is always looking for a way to improve the living of his family. Currently Muminjon needs a loan of 2,300 USD in order to purchase more cattle and later resell after breeding them. This will allow him to fully meet the needs of his family and educate all of his children.    \r\n  \r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has 14 members, men and women.  This communal bank is dedicated to short cycle corn, orange and cocoa bean farming.\r\n\r\nFabiola is a corn, orange and cocoa bean farmer.  Her purchases and her sales take place in Chillanes Canton.  She\u2019s asking for the loan to buy seeds and farming supplies like urea, Matamonte [herbicide], fertilizer and weed killer to maintain her crops in good condition.\r\n\r\nThe loan will be very helpful because she\u2019ll be able to improve her quality of life.

M. y M., 39 years old, makes and sells hand woven mats. These traditional mats are used as beds or as a place to sit. Berta learned this age-old tradition from her mom. and believes it is important to pass on the art to her children. She dedicates her time to creating the mats and can produce up to a few dozen per week if that's all she's working on. Her children help with the weaving, and Berta is pleased to have money and not be dependent on her husband's meager earnings.\r\n<p>\r\nBerta is married and lives with her husband, who works in the fields.

Her business is doing well. She works at the business for 12 hours per day, five days per week and is assisted by one employee. Salma currently earns about 300 USD from her business.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women and uses the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets; thus they are deemed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro-leasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":212540,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Office Supplies","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To purchase additional stock of stationary","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Dar es Salaam","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-6.8 39.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-10-17T01:10:16Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Salma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-10-31T09:34:09Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2008-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-01-31T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-03-31T07:00:00Z","amount":100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":85},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":85},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":85},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":85},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":85}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":85,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2008-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T04:22:22Z","rounded_local_amount":102467.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5348063},{"amount":85,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2008-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-17T09:15:34Z","rounded_local_amount":102467.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9970646},{"amount":85,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:17:21Z","rounded_local_amount":102467.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14886863},{"amount":85,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:04:53Z","rounded_local_amount":102467.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20436123},{"amount":85,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:57:53Z","rounded_local_amount":102467.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130396}],"funded_date":"2008-10-17T09:34:09Z","paid_date":"2009-04-15T21:57:53Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jason Groce","image":null}},{"id":73198,"name":"Rosa Angelica","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Rosa pertenece al Banco Comunal \u201cCoraz\u00f3n de Jes\u00fas\u201d, ubicado en el Jr. Angamos Mz.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

The main source of income for the business comes primarily from processing and selling pork products in the local community, particularly pork longganisa and tocino.

R. was born in and lives in the Barlovento neighborhood of Barranquilla.  It is an ancient community, which was invaded.  It is extremely vulnerable.  It is characterized by the activity of recycling.  Since she was little she was involved in making food because her parents did.  They did this on the outskirts of the ancient town river. They worked in this area because of its proximity to a branch of the largest river in Colombia, El Magdalena.\n\nShe is the oldest of four siblings.  She lived with her mother and the abandonment of her father.  That is why she saw the need to help with the household chores and with the business when she was barely ten years old.  She helped in order to get her younger siblings ahead.  This prevented her from going to school.  Reading and writing were not a practical necessity, and they were not important to the families of that era.\n\nRepeating her parents\u2019 history, Mar\u00eda del Carmen had twins after becoming engaged.  At first, her spouse supplied the basic family necessities.  But, after a short amount of time he abandoned them.  She had to work very hard to get her family ahead.  Without an education, and with the knowledge of the work she learned as a child, she started to sell \u201carepas de huevo\u201d (egg-filled savory corn cakes), empanadas, \u201ccariba\u00f1ola\u201d (small pie made with dough or puree of yucca that is filled with stew like ingredients and then fried), and fast food in the towns that are close to where the festivities for the national holidays are held.  \n\nAs a result of her second relationship, which lasted a short amount of time because he died, she built a house and educated her children until they had a technical career.  As time went by, she acquired the restaurant that her mother left her when she died.  The restaurant is now in her house, and her daughter and her sister work there.  \n\nFinancially helped with two loans, which she successfully repaid, from the Mario Santo Domino Foundation, she has been able to make on-site improvements to the infrastructure.  With her third loan, Mar\u00eda will buy chairs and utensils.  Her customers have increased, and when they arrive they have to wait for empty spaces to eat.  Everything then turns into chaos.  She will also buy rice, pork ribs, bacon, chicken, vinegar, oil, vegetables, and capers; which are the ingredients for making pies, \u201chayacas\u201d (cornmeal, meat and vegetables wrapped in banana leaves) or special foods; which are made from bijao leaves.  This is one of her specialties.  This way she takes advantage of the consumer habits that the customers have this time of year, and she will increase her sales.\n\nMar\u00eda\u2019s daughter helps her with reading and writing to participate in the business trainings.  Together they apply what they have learned to benefit the restaurant.  Her happiness, tenacity, love of work, deliverance, sacrifice and constant work stand out to us.  She has overcome adversity to give her family an improved well being.  Her greatest goal is that her children be able to continue with the business.  The business will be technically updated and perpetuated through the new generations.  Her greatest worry is the labor instability that reigns and puts the economy at risk.

She has been in this line of work for 20 years, and in that time has managed to significantly improve her family's living standards and pay to educate her children. By all appearances, her business is in good shape, and produces revenues of almost 500,000 Ugandan shillings a month. The prospects for growth also seem strong, which is why she is applying for a loan to buy more items to sell in her shop. By increasing her income, this loan will allow her to continue paying for her children's education, expand her business, and develop a small plot of land she owns into a profitable farm.

She now has a small grocery store in her home, which she and her husband run. The store is well-used by their neighbours, with opening hours from 6am to 9pm. For the moment, Se\u00f1ora Nolvia has no health problems, but there are seasons when sales drop and so do her earnings. Her goal is to grow the business and in this way increase her earnings to improve her quality of life. She is seeking the loan to buy sugar, rice, soft drinks, butter, meat, chicken, canned foods, bread, cookies, churros, sweets, sauces, pasta, etc. With the help of the loan, she will have more and better stock in her store, and her customers will be able to buy everything they need. She has worked with [field partner] FAMA before and is very grateful for the support she has received. She is very reliable in making her repayments. \r\n\r\nThe other members of the group are: Vilia Oneida L.

She lives in her own home with her husband and two children.  For the past twelve years, she has been selling trinkets.  She also makes and sells rosaries and crucifix charms to sell to churches and at commercial stores in the central market.  In the beginning Martha produced her own woven chains, pearl necklaces, and rosary charms.  However, the work was tedious and she sometimes did not have enough supplies to complete her orders.  Then she contracted the work of producing chains and pearl necklaces to her friends and neighbors and has done very well since then.  Now she is able to complete all of the orders that are submitted to her.  For this reason, Martha is very pleased with the work she has accomplished and wants to improve her sales methods.  All of her products are contained in a catalog from which she offers every type of rosary.  What she enjoys most about her job is that it is profitable and allows her to pay her four workers.

Her customers were her neighbors and her closest friends who have gradually recommended her to a lot more people.  As a result, she has managed to achieve a slight increase in new customers.  Her business assets are represented more than anything in her accounts receivable which have a turnover period of 14 days, and in her inventory.  Although she has a good profit margin, she doesn't have enough working capital to respond to her customers' orders.

Now her existing customers refer new customers to her and her customer base is growing notably. \r\n\r\nRosa's main goal is to strengthen her business.  For this reason, she needs to have a display cabinet so that she can keep her merchandise more ordered and be able to better display the products that she sells.

Having suffered a lot due to his parents being poor, he works incessantly to struggle with life\u2019s difficulties.  His talents allow him to properly meet the expectations of his customers, and he is highly valued in his neighborhood.  As a result of this encouragement, he started producing different kinds of shoes, bags and purses, belts, and other goods that he sells in the marketplaces of Tabligbo.  This business, which could be very profitable for him, has had trouble developing because he does not have enough capital at his disposal.  The shoes that he makes are highly appreciated in the marketplace, and he even receives orders from Lom\u00e9, the capital city.  He really needs financial support to be able to bolster and develop his business.  \r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\r\nAnd so he is requesting a loan of $850 as capital to buy a machine and some materials of the trade in order to produce and sell shoes, bags, belts, etc.  The success of his plans will allow him to improve living conditions for him and his parents.

He is a very hard worker as he had to rely on his lands in order to feed his family. He has made efforts to educate some of his kids, but just as his parents could not afford to send him to school past the elementary level, there were times when he could not afford to educate all nine children. He still lives with some of his sons who help him on the farm. They all work the fields together in order to cultivate rice and sell it in the city. He hopes the loan will help him be more productive.  <\/p>\r\n<h4>The Santa Lucia Communal Bank<\/h4> \r\n<p> Victor is part of the newest Communal Banks in the recently developed Mifex Rural Finance Program.  All of the members of the Centro Agricola de Santa Lucia Communal Bank are part of an Association of Rice Farmers in Santa Lucia. Their association works cooperatively to help in the commercialization of the product after it has grown. They will use the micro-loans to prepare their lands and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each others' guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the Primero de Agosto Association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many micro-finance programs, but Mifex believes that is imperative for the communities we works with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties.<\/p> \r\n<p><em>Below is more information about Santa Lucia compiled by Luis Crespo and Robert Edgar of the Mifex team when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. Special thanks to Mario Balazantegui who provided expert insight and contributed to the development of the alliances with the local organizations. <\/em><\/p> \r\n<h4>Economy of Santa Lucia<\/h4> \r\n<p>Santa Lucia County has a population of about 33,000 people. The sector is fit for rice cultivating because it is not in the lowlands and therefore it is not at risk of flooding. There is also great access to water because of the Daule River, which is accessible to many of the farmers in the area. About 70% of the farmers have basic infrastructure for watering their crops. <\/p> \r\n<p>Rice production is the main economic activity of the area as about 80% of the people are rice farmers. Almost everyone is either directly or indirectly involved with rice production, as they produce, commercialize or participate in activities that add value to the product. Within the county, there is a small town also named Santa Lucia. The town is filled with many small businesses and it serves as the social and commercial hub of the area.  <\/p> \r\n<h4>Rice Farming in Santa Lucia<\/h4> \r\n<p>Most of the people in the Santa Lucia area are small farmers. They produce about 100 sacks of rice per hectare of land. In order to farm they first must prepare the lands by removing weeds and plowing. The farmers then fill an area with water to form what is known as a paddy field, because rice is a very water intensive crop. The rice seeds are either dispersed freely (the process is known as <i>boleo<\/i> in Spanish) or hand sowed. Once the rice has grown, most farmers rent machinery that helps them gather their production. A risk factor does exist in rice farming because of drought, but in Santa Lucia this is somewhat mitigated by the access to water form the nearby river.  <\/p> \r\n<h4>Access to Credit<\/h4> \r\n<p>The biggest struggle in the area has been the lack of credit. Because people do not count on formal financial services, they have turned to loan sharks for financing. They have been affected by expensive lines of credit that exceed 100% interest a year and can be as expensive as 240%. Intermediaries also exploit the farmers because of their outstanding debt. Farmers also lack skills and knowledge to commercialize their products and pay fair prices for their crops.  <\/p> \r\n<h4>Loan Use<\/h4> \r\n<p>The loans in this sector will be used to to buy soil, seeds, fertilizer and insecticides. They will also be used to prepare the land prior to farming, to plant the seeds and purchase other materials. The loan repayment schedule is also different from the typical micro-entrepreneur. Because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures, Mifex asks them only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 6 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the seventh and final month. <\/p> \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":25081,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Rice Farming","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Santa Lucia","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.183333 -80","type":"point"}},"partner_id":7,"posted_date":"2007-04-11T00:05:22Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1200,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Victor Manuel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-04-29T17:48:41Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1200,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":1200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-05-29T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-06-29T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-07-29T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-08-29T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-09-29T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-10-29T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-11-29T08:00:00Z","amount":171.42}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":171.42}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":172,"local_amount":172,"processed_date":"2007-06-08T09:15:22Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T06:56:37Z","rounded_local_amount":172,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":21394},{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-08-09T23:18:13Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T06:56:37Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":40781},{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-08-22T18:12:59Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T06:56:37Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":45300},{"amount":812,"local_amount":812,"processed_date":"2007-12-18T18:10:40Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T06:56:37Z","rounded_local_amount":812,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":99054},{"amount":100,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2008-01-02T21:53:18Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T06:56:37Z","rounded_local_amount":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":106814}],"funded_date":"2007-04-15T17:48:41Z","paid_date":"2008-01-02T21:53:18Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":11750,"name":"Gulbudag","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Gulbudag S. owns and operates a tea house\/restaurant in the town of Khachmaz on the North Eastern coast of Azerbaijan.

The two previous loans with Impro have been paid in full.\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Spanish by Christian Garcia, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nEl se\u00f1or Pablo Mendiz\u00e1bal vive en casa propia en la zona de Pasankeri ladera oeste de la Ciudad de La Paz con su madre y su peque\u00f1a hija de 8 a\u00f1os;  Pablo es profesor y trabaja en el magisterio de la ciudad de La Paz.\r\nCon los cr\u00e9ditos anteriores en Impro construy\u00f3 un muro de contenci\u00f3n para estabilizar su vivienda.\r\nEl cr\u00e9dito solicitado ser\u00e1 destinado a la construcci\u00f3n completa de una habitaci\u00f3n de ladrillo sobre loza de hormig\u00f3n armado. \r\nSu antecedente hist\u00f3rico con Impro, y el an\u00e1lisis socio econ\u00f3mico lo califica como cliente preferencial y puede acceder  un nuevo cr\u00e9dito.

Annamaria owns a business - she started a bird farm 5 years ago, and is currently raising 60 chickens, 23 turkeys, 80 ducks, and 30 guinea foul. The poultry business - sale of meat and eggs to supermarkets - allows her to earn a profit of around US$280 a month. Annamaria uses around US$65 of this amount for the maintenance of her farm.

She is married and has two children, ages 32 and 34. Additionally, she is responsible for supporting one dependant because his parents do not take care of him. Febronia has been running a poultry business since 2006. Raising kuku (kuku means chicken in Swahili) is popular in Tanzania, because they require little start-up capital. Poeple can start with one or two, and either buy additional ones as they have the money or they can let them multiply naturally! Also, chickens do not require much space, so sometimes they just let them run around in their garden or compound. In addition, while the chicks are growing they produce eggs, which can either be sold to provide a supplementary source of income, or eaten to provide a supplementary source of protein. Febronia's business is doing well; she works at the business for eight hours per day, seven per week and is assisted by one employee. Febronia currently earns about $300 USD from her business. She is requesting a loan of $850 USD to purchase additional chicks, chicken feed, and veterinary medicines. In the future, she plans to expand her business. Febronia thanks you for your support!\r\n\r\n<p>SELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through micro-leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.

It has produced famous thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. A civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged an already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural productivity and the manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b><br>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent viable business prospects. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The majority of the area consists of rugged terrain. The main crops grown in this region are maize, beans, barley, wheat, beans, peas, and potatoes.  In the lower parts, you can find sugar cane and a variety of fruit trees.  Mineral deposits of silver and iron crisscross the parish from north to south, and limestone formations also exist in the region. The main industry is agriculture, although many residents engage in making woven straw hats and shawls.\r\n<p>\r\n\u201cCampesinas de Ruizho\u201d is comprised of individuals who are highly collaborative, organized and punctual.  The development of their rural businesses is the common bond that brings them together.  Whenever anyone needs help with a particular project, they work together as a group (in community events known as \u201cmingas\u201d), and celebrate together afterwards. \r\n<p>\r\nSra. Miriam Carmita Pe\u00f1alosa C. is a native of Ruizho.  She is 24 years old and lives in a common law relationship with Jorge Suqui (who is a mason).  She says she doesn\u2019t want to get married in order to avoid problems in case she decides to separate at any point.  Two children (ages 8 and 6) have resulted from her relationship.  They attend the community school in Ruizho.  Miriam and Jorge have been together 8 years and are very happy.  She dedicates most of her time to taking care of her children, raising animals, working on her farm, and operating a bakery.    \r\n<p>\r\nLately, she has spent more time working in her bakery.  She learned the profession through a government arrangement with local communities.  The institution that administers this program is called SECAP (Center for Vocational Training).  In this two year program, students learn to make bread according to customer orders, usually producing 100-200 loaves each day.  The bread is sold to stores for $0.08 USD each, which is then marked up to $0.10-0.12 USD when sold to the public.   \r\n<p>\r\nMiriam is requesting $330 to buy dairy cows so that she can supplement her income by selling milk.

For instance, during the school year she sells notebooks, pencils and color pens, while during the Christmas season she sells toys. \r\nShe sells on credit: her customers choose the item and pay rates until they have fully paid the price and then they receive the item. This way she is making more revenue and can offer an easier way to pay to her customers. \r\nThis is her third loan with MFP and she has always fully repaid. For this reason she was considered for a new loan in her commune bank.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.<p>\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.<p>\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Three of her children are still of school-going age. Alice lives in Mvuma and her husband is employed by a local forestry company. She operates a business from a flea market in Mvuma where she sells clothing and formal shoes for both men and women. The clothing she sells includes men\u2019s suits, women's suits, t-shirts, dresses, jeans, and blankets. She also receives rent of $25 every month from her tenant, which helps her supplement her income. \r\nAlice used the loan she was granted to purchase suits for both men and women.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is single, 41 years old, and the mother of 2 children, who still depend on her.  Mar\u00eda Eloisa has dedicated the past 5 years to making and tailoring dresses.  Before that, she worked in education.  After losing her job, she made her mind up to start her own dressmaking workshop, and, since she already had the skills to make nice dresses, she did not hesitate to begin working on this goal.  Bit by bit she has earned money and saved her income, working from within her own home, which is a pleasant working environment for her.  She tells us that her dressmaking is going very well, and that she now receives orders ahead of time from customers who want her to make dresses for them.  She treats all of her customers with her characteristic friendliness and charisma.  Her dream, a goal which she continues striving to achieve, is to open her own proper dressmaking workshop, complete with new machines, switching out the old ones for new ones.  She also hopes to complete building her own home, and by doing so provide security and comfort to her children.  With this loan of 2,800 Soles, she will purchase meters of fabric of different types and colors, as well as instruments she uses in her dressmaking, such as scissors, large spools of thread in a variety of colors, sewing needles for hand and machine use, pins, and buttons.  Today, she is a very satisfied woman, and she continues working hard to make a reality of the dreams she has not yet achieved.  She gives her thanks to the Movimiento Manuela Ramos for helping her to get her business started, and also to the many women who wish to grow and succeed as business owners.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Kevin Lenhart, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":975,"image":{"id":373277,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Tailoring","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"Comprar\u00e1 telas en metros, agujas, etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"San Mart\u00edn","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":72,"posted_date":"2009-08-20T20:00:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":975,"lender_count":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Eloisa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-07-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2800,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":975,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":466.67},{"due_date":"2009-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":466.67},{"due_date":"2009-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":466.67},{"due_date":"2009-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":466.67},{"due_date":"2009-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":466.67},{"due_date":"2010-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":466.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":162.5},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":162.5},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":162.5},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":162.5},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":162.51},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":162.49}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":162.62,"local_amount":467,"processed_date":"2009-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T18:51:32Z","rounded_local_amount":478.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73635706},{"amount":162.38,"local_amount":466.34,"processed_date":"2009-09-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T22:45:45Z","rounded_local_amount":477.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87074853},{"amount":162.5,"local_amount":466.67,"processed_date":"2009-10-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T02:09:01Z","rounded_local_amount":477.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96990217},{"amount":162.61,"local_amount":466.99,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:42:57Z","rounded_local_amount":478.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103835143},{"amount":162.4,"local_amount":466.35,"processed_date":"2009-12-21T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T15:07:49Z","rounded_local_amount":477.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110726940},{"amount":162.49,"local_amount":466.65,"processed_date":"2010-01-21T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:06:05Z","rounded_local_amount":477.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118117473}],"funded_date":"2009-08-20T23:23:43Z","paid_date":"2010-02-15T12:06:05Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kevin Lenhart","image":null}},{"id":134707,"name":"Nver","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Nver S. is 39.

Angelina has been engaged in her business for over 5 years and earns approximately 2,500 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Angelina joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Angelina is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Angelina from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay the tuition fees of her children. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 29 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Her mother insisted that she continue her studies and not fall in love too early, as she did, and not finish her studies.  This is how she decided to make patterns and perfect her sewing with an old, pedal sewing machine.  Then her mother gave her a more modern machine as a gift and she added new designs.  So when she married she decided to support her household with her profession.  Her discipline and friendly disposition helped her to increase her clientele.  \r\n\r\nShe now has two machines, racks, mannequins and showcases, but she needs to improve her turn around time.  For this reason, with her Kiva loan, she will buy a serger sewing machine and special fabrics and trims in large volume.  At the end of the year, she is going to dress her customers elegantly to say goodbye to 2010.  Miriam is a recognized seamstress in her area and she calls herself \"The Golden Needle of Siape\" making a comparison with the famous Columbian designer, Amalin D. Hazbun.  \r\n\r\nIn December she aims to increase her business 30% and, in January and February, Carnival will help her to increase her sales even more.  This way she will strengthen her business so that she can fulfill her dream of handing down her profession to her descendants.

The local economy is sustained primarily by the textile industry, which has its origins in the late nineteenth century.  These factories produced wool cloth.  The Bellavista Oveja Factory in Tom\u00e9 shut down in 2007, creating high unemployment which has since been eased by new business activities.

Tomas has been engaged in his business for over six years and earns approximately $75 a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn July of 2009, Tomas joined HSPFI, a Kiva field partner, to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation by engaging in business activities. Tomas is requesting a loan of 5000 PHP which will be used to purchase materials needed to expand the services he provides. This will be his first loan from HSPFI. He plans to use the additional revenue generated from the loan to expand his business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, we created this template for our field staff to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":125,"image":{"id":373314,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Transportation","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"to

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.

She has been a member of U-IMCEC (a Senegalese association of mutual savings and loans institutions) since July 2009. She has six children, the ages of whom range from two to 18 years old. Mrs. M. is a fish merchant and has been selling fish for five years. Not wanting to remain inactive, she followed the example of other women in her neighborhood who carry out this activity and make a profit from it. She prefers to focus on the cold season when there are more fish. This is the best season to make money. The profitability of her primary acitivity has allowed her to open a shop where she sells cosmetic products.

She is married to Samphors, 39, who drives a motorbike taxi. Mrs. P. used to be a laborer in a garment factory. Because this work only provided her with a small salary that was not enough to contribute to her family, she started selling goods in front of the taxi park. Mrs. P. sells items like snack food and soft drinks to passengers who wait to take taxis. By doing this, she hopes she will be able to earn much more income to fulfill all of her family's needs.

They live in the Santa Rosa locality, located in the beautiful Ayacuchan jungle, where Antonia has her own house. For Antonia 'the key to success lies in constant work and the knowledge to take advantage of opportunities'. Because of this outlook Antonia has a measured calmness and nothing throws her, as she recognises that the world is changeable and she tries to be prepared for whatever event presents itself. Antonia's product is well-known in her locality, owing to the quality and good service she provides to each and every customer, and for a long time she has maD. good profits. Usually Antonia works with her family and together they make a good working team - only during harvest time do they have to contract agricultural labourers to extract their product and sell it in the stock centres in her zone at a competitive price.

Thanks to her knack at sales, she's been able to develop this profession very well and constantly needs to update her inventory to keep up with the latest trends, so that her customers will continue to buy from her.\r\n\r\nThis job is very profitable and her earnings allow her to help her husband with the household expenses.  What she enjoys most is that she is tuned in to the latest trends, but she never the less has to put all of her efforts into selling her merchandise, having to travel the streets to reach her customers.

She began to investigate what work she could do. About 2 years ago, one of her friends recommended that she sell lingerie and girdles on commission. She decided she'd try that business. Little by little she brought in more clients, which increased her income, since her commissions increased as she sold more clothing.<p>Juana is applying for a loan of $250 to buy merchandise and fill existing client orders.
