The official name of this borrowing group is Arceli B.\u2019s Group.\r\n\r\nArceli is 45 years old, is married, and has three school-aged children. She owns and operates a business raising pigs for fattening and for sale. She has been engaged in her business for over six years and earns approximately 5,000 PHP a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Arceli joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase piglets to raise and sell.\r\n\r\nArceli is requesting a new loan of 15,000 PHP which will again be used to purchase piglets to raise and sell. This loan will be her fifth from ASKI.

The members of the bank live in different areas but their businesses are located in areas near the offices of Emprender.  The various products and services offered by the members include selling clothing, auto repair, making blankets, tailoring, and selling sporting goods.  \r\n\r\nRosa is one of the representatives of the communal bank and serves as its president.  She lives in two rented rooms in the Pampahasi area where she has lived since she was very young. She has a small sewing workshop and works primarily by hand as she receives cuts of fabric (fabric cut in quantity for businesses or small micro-businesses) for sewing and later delivery of garments. She learned this trade 7 years ago in Argentina where she lived for about two years. After returning, she got married and spent a year setting up her small workshop. The members of her family include her husband Nestor and her daughter Cielo who is 5 years old. One of her goals is to buy a house.  She would also like to better equip her workshop in order to have her own sewing customers.  The purpose of the loan is for the purchase of a sewing machine as one machine is not enough to handle her orders. \r\n\r\nRebeca is the bank\u2019s recording secretary.  She has been selling made to order blankets for one year.   The loan will be used to raise capital for the purchase of wool and necessary material. She says that she has been living with her husband for three years.  She was studying and selling flowers in the Rodrigues market, the most populous market in the city of La Paz, until her husband had an accident and she had to seek additional sources of income.  She learned to make blankets along with her mother-in-law which allowed her to cope with the problem she was experiencing.   At the time this happened, a year ago today, she was struggling to stabilize herself financially.  Her goal and dream is to have her own workshop with weaving machines and later have her own house and make progress along with her family. In her communal bank, she stands out as responsible, punctual in her payments, and very light-hearted, although she is quite young. \r\n\r\nAlejandrina, a new member, was elected as manager of the group based on leadership qualities which became evident during the loan process. She lives in Villa Salome in her mother-in-law\u2019s house in which she occupies two rooms and a small kitchen. She lives with her husband and three children. She has decided to start selling fruit to help her husband with the household expenses as two of her children are in school and need food and clothing. She works from 5:00 in the morning until 6:00 in the evening. The loan she is requesting will be used to raise capital to buy seasonal fruits.

Her son attends kindergarten while her mother is retired and stays at home with Lhagvasuren\u2019s daughter.\r\n\r\nLhagvasuren started her business in 2008 by selling firewood at Tsaiz, Mongolia\u2019s biggest raw materials outdoor market, with help from her husband. As a result of their hard work, today, they have working capital of 7,100,000 Mongolian Tugriks (MNT) and equipment of 3,000,000 MNT. They buy raw materials from the wood truck which comes from the countryside and then they cut the wood using a cutting machine to sell as firewood.\r\n\r\nLhagvasuren is requesting a loan of 2,000,000 MNT to buy wood this season as the price will be lower compared to summer. Therefore she can buy wood at a low price and produce firewood to sell at a higher price in the summer. Lhagvasuren wants her children to get an excellent education and her goal is to build a new small house for her family. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1600,"image":{"id":762791,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fuel\/Firewood","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to purchase more wood.

She lives in her own home with her partner and their much loved daughter, 11 year old Keyli, who is Yobana's motivation for everything she does. Yobana had a deprived childhood which she managed to overcome with perseverance. By the age of 18 she was caring for herself independently. She left her job and started her own business - a grocery store - by selling her products while walking the streets. As time passed, and using what little savings she had, she managed to buy her own plot of land where her store is now located. She is not a woman to be reckoned with; that is to say, she is the kind of person who achieves her objectives through great effort and tenacity. These days she is happy with her business activities, her great charisma and her kindness in all her dealings. She has become a favourite with her neighbours, who have been her loyal clients since the early days of her business. Her profits have been used to buy her own 2 hec. farm where her husband now works. Yobana needs this loan to continue earning and providing a good service to her customers. This will be her sixth loan with MFP and she has repaid her previous loans on time. She hopes to be able to buy the items she needs: cabinets and tables to display her stock stylishly.

Todos ellos habitan un hogar propio en la comunidad nativa de Pucharini.\n\nNorma trabaja la tierra desde ni\u00f1a sembrando caf\u00e9, plata y achiote, productos que le han dado a ella y a su familia el sustento necesario hasta el momento; ya que cuentan con 2 parcelas y media de terreno, priorizando la plantaci\u00f3n de caf\u00e9. Por su parte, H\u00e9ctor su esposo se dedica de lleno a la agricultura, mientras ella trabaja en una embolsadora de caf\u00e9, en donde recibe un sueldo mensual, de esa manera percibe m\u00e1s ingresos.

Norma is married to 48-year-old H\u00e9ctor and has seven children, only four of whom still live with her.  They live together in their own home, in the indigenous community of Pucharini.\r\n\r\nNorma has been working the land since she was a girl, growing coffee, bananas and annatto, products which have provided both her and her family with the support they need up to now.  They have two and a half plots of land and prioritize the planting of coffee.  H\u00e9ctor, Norma's husband, farms full time whilst Norma works for a coffee packing company which pays her a monthly salary.  This makes her more income.  As if that weren't enough, Norma also sells food from her home on Sundays.  \"Despite the fact that my plots of land are small, I obtain three 120kg sacks of coffee from them.  We sell the coffee by the can.  Each can weighs 2 kilos and the price right now is 6 soles.  There are months when we sell for double that if we agree on it\", explains Norma.\r\n\r\nIn the future, Norma would like to live in a home with more comforts and more concise and hard-wearing infrastructure.  For example, she will have sewerage service installed and put in a sink as a priority.  In order to achieve this, she will continue working as she has up to now.  With your help, Norma will be able to obtain her fourth loan from MFP.  She pledges to make her repayments on time each month as she has been doing, together with the other members of her community bank.  Norma feels comfortable being part of her community bank because everybody cooperates and they know how to organize themselves.  Norma will use her loan money to buy iron, bags of cement and bricks so that she can start building the first walls of her new home.  In order to do this, H\u00e9ctor will have to divide his time so that he can build the house without neglecting his crops."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":907842,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":null,"use":"to buy cement, bricks and iron","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-11-04T16:40:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":575,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Norma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-10-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":575}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":274.82,"local_amount":716.92,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:55:15Z","rounded_local_amount":743.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301455290},{"amount":300.18,"local_amount":783.08,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:35:26Z","rounded_local_amount":811.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308452416}],"funded_date":"2011-11-06T21:19:31Z","paid_date":"2012-10-16T09:35:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Oxnard","image":null}},{"id":356946,"name":"Janet","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Janet lives in Uganda.

Sus principales materias primas son el coco, las semillas, los hilos, y el totumo, un fruto  que crece en Colombia, es de fuerte corteza  que se endurece cuando est\u00e1 maduro. Su arte forma parte de una tradici\u00f3n, usada en   la \u00e9poca precolombina, cuando  los ind\u00edgenas mocan\u00e1s que habitaron el centro y sur del Atl\u00e1ntico, utilizaban esta corteza para hacer vasijas -llamadas totumas- y cantimploras en las que almacenaban leche y agua y para uso  decorativo como lo hace Sadith.  Desde el a\u00f1o 2004 cuando estudiaba su bachillerato, su c\u00f3nyuge le ense\u00f1\u00f3 este oficio, en la actualidad ambos trabajan en su punto de ventas,  ubicado en una esquina muy  concurrida, y cerca de un centro comercial, lo cual hace posible que sus ventas cada d\u00eda aumenten mas, por eso trabajan sin descanso de lunes a domingo de 10:00 a m  a 9:00 p.m. Su competencia es alta pero tiene un buen surtido y esto es justamente lo que atrae a sus clientes, adem\u00e1s de su buen trato con ellos. En la actualidad est\u00e1 aplicando a su primer credikiva y tambi\u00e9n primer financiamiento que hace a la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, con el comprar\u00e1, hilos, piedras, acero, totumos semillas, al por mayor y de contado, con lo cual obtendr\u00e1 muchos descuentos por volumen de compra y por hacerlo de contado. ","en":"Sadith makes crafts such as bracelets, weavings, and the other handicrafts that she sells to customers at her stand. Her main raw materials are coconuts, seeds, thread and totumos, a fruit that grows in Colombia with a tough peel that hardens when it's ripe. \r\n\r\nHer art is part of a tradition, dating from the pre-Columbian era. The indigenous Mocan\u00e1s who inhabited the central and Atlantic south parts of the country, used these gourds to make dishes called totumas, canteens in which they stored milk and water, and for decorative purposes, as Sadith does.\r\n\r\nSince 2004, when she was studying for her diploma, her partner taught her this skill. Currently both work at her stand, located at a busy corner near a shopping mall, which enables her to increase her sales every day. That's why she works tirelessly from Monday to Sunday, from 10:00am to 9:00pm. \r\n\r\nHer competition is intense, but she has a good stock, and this is precisely what attracts her customers; besides how well she treats them. At present, she is applying for her first Credikiva, which is also her first loan from the Fundaci\u00f3n Santo Domingo. With the money, she will buy thread, stones, metal, totumos and seeds at wholesale, for cash, so that she gets a lot of discounts for volume purchase and for paying cash.

","en":"Lino S. Z. is a 45-year-old man who has four children.  Two of them live on their own and two are with him.  He makes a living selling and buying pigs.  He also sells firewood from his home.  He began his work twelve years ago when he was living in a chaotic situation and his kids started needing things like, better nutrition.  Finding himself in this situation, he decided to begin collecting firewood and to go out and sell it in a small cart.  They were difficult times since the money was often spent on feeding his family, until his wife gave him the idea of raising pigs.  With her help, they have been able to get ahead by doing this.  Lino started earning more and began to ask for loans to buy another donkey, since the former one was very old and he was afraid that it would die soon and he wouldn\u2019t know what to do.  Mr. Lino would like to educate his children so they are not simple firewood salesmen and pig farmers like he is.  A father wants the best for his kids and this is why Lino is requesting a loan, believing he will receive it, since he needs to invest in buying wholesale pigs so he can get a better price.\r\n<br

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Kenya) where she makes fresh chapatti, rice, and chips. She also sells fruit and sodas. Her shop is known at \u201cMama Japuony\u2019s\u201d by her regular customers due to the fact that her 9-year-old disabled son, Japuony (meaning \u201cteacher\u201d), is known in the community. Her older son, who is 18 years old, needs her financial help as he tries to finish secondary school (high school), and Frankline says that it is a challenge to pay his school fees.  She also has 5 children who are grown and out of the house.  \r\n\r\nFrankline has faced many challenges in her life and in her business. Currently, the rising food prices in Kenya are affecting her profit margins. She cannot fully pass on the increased costs to her customers since they are unwilling to pay much more for her meals. This comes after Frankline rebuilt her business in early 2008. The post-election violence in Kisumu, at the end of 2007, resulted in her kiosk being burned to the ground. Still, she has her mind set on success. She takes some goods to sell wherever she goes, hoping to find business along the way.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":150,"image":{"id":361207,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

central Mongolia. Her three oldest children are university students and the youngest is a secondary school student. Doljinjav  operates a mobile retail trading business in her town. With the help of her husband, who is a driver, she uses the family car to travel throughout the countryside selling goods to local farmers. In addition to her mobile business, Doljinjav also purchases dairy products from the farmers to sell at the local market or sometimes in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia's capital city.

Es una peque\u00f1a comunidad rural de aproximadamente dos mil habitantes. Sus pobladores se dedican a la producci\u00f3n de leche y siembra de caf\u00e9. Tiene un relieve irregular y mucho del terreno se mantiene como bosque tropical h\u00famedo. La comunidad tiene paisajes muy pintorescos que combinan el bosque tropical con dos lindas lagunas, plantaciones de caf\u00e9 y lecher\u00edas. El Sauce se localiza aproximadamente a hora y media en bus de Turrialba, el centro de comercio m\u00e1s cercano. Sin embargo, varias veces al a\u00f1o el camino se vuelve intransitable por las lluvias que azotan la zona. Este es sin duda uno de los principales desaf\u00edos para la comunidad. \n\nCuando no exist\u00edan actividades muchas personas optaron por salir a buscar trabajos en Turrialba o en fincas bananeras ubicadas en la Zona Atl\u00e1ntica de Costa Rica. Actualmente los precios del caf\u00e9 y la leche han mejorado, por lo tanto los vecinos buscan c\u00f3mo invertir en proyectos en la misma zona y de esta forma evitar migrar.\n\nComo parte de las respuestas a esa situaci\u00f3n, desde hace dos a\u00f1os se instal\u00f3 en la comunidad una planta de elaboraci\u00f3n de quesos, propiedad de la Asociaci\u00f3n de Productores de Leche de El Sauce, hecho que motiv\u00f3 a do\u00f1a Carmen a iniciar en la producci\u00f3n de leche para luego venderla a esta planta. \n\nDo\u00f1a Carmen desea obtener un micro cr\u00e9dito de \u00a2500,000 (quinientos mil colones) para comprar una vaca lechera y poder iniciar con su negocio ya que quiere ser una microempresaria exitosa y  as\u00ed poder ayudar a sacar a su familia adelante esto es una de las cosas que la motiva a esforzarse y trabajar con mucho esmero. \n\nDo\u00f1a Carmen es socia de la Asociaci\u00f3n de Productores de El Sauce, una de las 100 organizaciones socias de EDESA en Costa Rica.

R. is 52 years old. She lives with her husband and their son in a community called El Sauce in Santa Teresita de Turrialba, Province of Cartago. This is a small rural community with around two thousand people. They are work producing milk and growing coffee. It has an irregular terrain and a lot of it is maintained as humid tropical forest. The community has traditional landscapes that mix with the tropical forest, with two nice lagoons, coffee plantations and milk factories. El Sauce is located about an hour and a half from Turrialba, the closest commercial center. However, several times a year, the road is closed due to the heavy rain in the area. This is without a doubt one of the main challenges of the community.\r\nWhen there was nothing to do in town, a lot of people decided to go to Turrialba for work or to banana farms in the Atlantic coast in Costa Rica. Right now, coffee and milk prices have improves, so the neighbors are looking for ways to invest their money in the area and avoid migrations.\r\nDue to this situation, two years ago, a cheese manufacturing company was installed in her community for the El Sauce\u2019s Milk Producer\u2019s Association. This motivated her to begin producing milk to resell it to the plant.\r\nThis time, Carmen would like to get a \u00a2500.00 loan (five hundred colones) to purchase a milking cow and start her own business. She wants to be a successful entrepreneur to help her family. This motivates her to make sacrifices and work hard.\r\n\r\nCarmen is a member of the El Sauce Farmers Association, one of the 100 member organizations of EDESA in Costa Rica. This will be his ninth loan. She hopes to continue growing at a personal level and financial level. She also believes it\u2019s important to mention that thanks to these type of organizations she is able to devote more time to productive activities.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jimena

She likes to get to know her customers, and to recommend the styles that are suitable for their size and age but  she admits that at times, when she does not have the sales she hoped for, she feels disappointed.  Nonetheless, she continues to strive; she always sells something without having lost her investment.  For this reason, she regards this activity as profitable, and she lives comfortably thanks to the profits she earns.

N. was born in the capital of Mocambique, Maputo city in 1977. She spent all her childhood there living with her parents and siblings. She studied until 10th grade, but she stopped because she got married and also because she did not have enough money to support her studies. She is married and has a young child, and she takes care of her parents who currently live with her. \r\n\r\nIt is the first time she is asking for a loan with Hluvuku (Kiva's partner in Mozambique) or any other institution. She learned about them from her father's work colleague. She is asking for a loan to purchase zinc sheets, cement, paints and other construction materials to refurbish her home where and her entire family lives. She came to request her loan in person and when we went to take a picture of the family home, she was not available, so we show you a picture of her father, who will also benefit from the loan.\r\n\r\nShe is currently employed, helping at the till of a retail business. She learned the job from her boss five years ago. She makes 2,500 meticais a month and she is able to save about 1,000 meticais every month, so she is confident she will be able to repay the loan without problems.\r\n\r\nHer dream in life is to see her parents' home in a good condition for all her family to live

With the help of her past six loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Erlinda has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow.

She is a single mother and, in spite of the constant problems that she faces, she is proud of her daughter Mar\u00eda.  The pair live in their own home which is located in the small village of Patay.\r\n\r\nSonia gets up very early in the morning so that she can prepare her food and send her daughter off to school.  She then goes out to care for and weed her crops until late at night.  As she says \"for as long as my body can withstand it\".  Sonia has been growing potatoes (a Peruvian tuber), peas and gladioli flowers for 29 years.  Like the true businesswoman she is, Sonia also opened a small store where she sells basic household products.  In the future, she would like to increase her sales.  She would like to buy more seeds and grow crops in larger quantities.  This will enable her to sell at a better price and provide her daughter, who is the driving force behind her progress and work, with an excellent quality of life.  She tells us that in a few months time she will harvest the gladioli that she sowed.\r\n\r\nSonia belongs to the 'Virgen de F\u00e1tima' community bank and this is her tenth loan from MFP.  She is grateful for the security which her community bank gives her.  For this reason, she pledges to be punctual in making her repayments.  With your support, Sonia will invest the money she has requested in buying two bags of pea seeds, several sacks of natural fertilizers and, if she has money left over, she will buy basic household products for her grocery store."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":871742,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy two bags of pea seeds, sacks of fertilizer, and products with which to stock her store","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-09-19T11:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":750,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sonia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-09-09T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":750}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":750,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:28:55Z","rounded_local_amount":2047.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270098656}],"funded_date":"2011-09-19T13:40:24Z","paid_date":"2012-04-15T10:28:55Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Oxnard","image":null}},{"id":340554,"name":"Patrick","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Patrick successfully paid back his previous loan in full, four months ahead of schedule.

He hopes that this will enable him to continue running his business successfully and make the business more profitable. \nIn the future, Marwan would like to get a job and get married.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":983891,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":["Arab Youth","Youth","Islamic Finance"],"use":"to purchase grocery supplies.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"YE","country":"Yemen","town":"Ibb","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15.5 47.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":205,"posted_date":"2012-01-23T19:30:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":700,"lender_count":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marwan","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-16T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"YER","disbursal_amount":150000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":18750},{"due_date":"2012-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":18750},{"due_date":"2012-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":18750},{"due_date":"2012-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":18750},{"due_date":"2012-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":18750},{"due_date":"2012-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":18750},{"due_date":"2012-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":18750},{"due_date":"2012-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":18750}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":18750,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T08:19:43Z","rounded_local_amount":19173.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263232280},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":18750,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T08:17:13Z","rounded_local_amount":19173.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":269957047},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":18750,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T08:34:22Z","rounded_local_amount":19173.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276563324},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":18750,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T08:56:41Z","rounded_local_amount":19173.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283050469},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":18750,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T08:09:36Z","rounded_local_amount":19173.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287072010},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":18750,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T08:41:29Z","rounded_local_amount":19173.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294266881},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":18750,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T08:51:34Z","rounded_local_amount":19173.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301320220},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":18750,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T08:37:09Z","rounded_local_amount":19173.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308341156}],"funded_date":"2012-01-23T22:20:40Z","paid_date":"2012-10-16T08:37:09Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Paul & Rachel Norridge","image":828426}},{"id":755038,"name":"Sena Seme Group","description":{"languages":["fr"],"texts":{"fr":"Le groupe SENA SEME est compos\u00e9 de trois personnes qui r\u00e9sident dans la m\u00eame maison.

This time, she wants to borrow 1100 USD to buy more beverages to sell. \r\n\r\n<b><p>Translated from Vietnamese by Duy Hua, Kiva volunteer.<\/p><\/b>\r\n\r\nCh\u1ecb \u0110\u1eb7ng Th\u1ecb Tuy\u1ec1n n\u0103m nay 31 tu\u1ed5i, ch\u1ecb tham gia v\u00e0o Qu\u1ef9 t\u00ecnh th\u01b0\u01a1ng t\u1eeb n\u0103m 2003.

She is 66 years old. Zoila is married and has 8 children. To make a living, Zoila owns and operates a business venture in the retail sector running a general store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling a variety of different products in the local community. Zoila has been engaged in her business for over 9 years and earns approximately 500 PHP a month from these activities.<P>\r\n\r\nIn 2000, Zoila joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Zoila has successfully repaid a previous loan of 20,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional products to sell. Zoila is requesting a new loan of 20000 PHP which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This loan will be the 15th loan taken out by Zoila from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement the family's income. <P>\r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:<P>\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao.

She is 47 years old. Leonisa is married and has 3 school-aged children. To make a living, Leonisa owns & operates a \"sari-sari\" or retail store. The main source of income for the business comes from selling daily use products such as shampoo, soap and toothpaste in the local community. Leonisa is just starting this business.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Leonisa joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Leonisa has successfully repaid a previous loan of 7000 PHP from GDMPC. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell in her \"sari-sari\" or retail store. Leonisa is requesting a new loan of 10000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the third loan taken out by Leonisa from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay the tuition fees of her children and for their basic needs. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

He is a high achiever and a consistent entrepreneur who is very knowledgeable about the market environment. His professional skills and perseverance have helped to ensure rapid growth and success of his business. Gufron is requesting a loan of 3000 Somoni to increase the assortment of his selling inventory. He is hoping that this loan will help his venture grow and generate extra profits.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He has been involved in buying and selling livestock for many years, but he also has another small source of family income.  Gafor owns a Gazel vehicle, which he placed into shuttle service.  This business brings in an average monthly income is 500 somoni.  However, his primarily activity is the livestock business.  He buys livestock from all the district markets and resells it for good money on market days.  Gafor's wife, Sanavbar, looks after the livestock.  He does not buy livestock feed since he grows it on his own land.  Gafor gets a benefit when he works with our organization because he can use cash to purchase livestock cheaper.

M. is a 37-year-old woman and lives in the town of Vaimoso Fou.  She is married and has 4 school-aged children.  To make a living, Diane  runs a food stall.  While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling baked goods in the local community.  Diane has been engaged in this business for over a year and earns approximately 2009 WST a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Diane joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve  her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Diane is requesting for the first time, a loan from SPBD.    Diane is requesting a loan of 1000 WST which will be used to purchase additional products to sell.  Diane plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business  to improve and expand her business.\r\n\r\nDiane was not affected by the tsunami which hit Samoa on 9\/29\/09. \r\n\r\nAbout SPBD:\r\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

She is 30 years old. Carina is married and has 3 school-aged children. To make a living, Carina owns & operates a business venture in the retail sector running a sari-sari (variety) retail shop. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling both food & daily use products in the local community. Carina has been engaged in her business for over 8 years and earns approximately 5000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Carina joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Carina has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional products to sell. Carina is requesting a new loan of 6000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional inventory & working capital. This loan will be the 2nd loan taken out by Carina from HSPFI.

She earns her living by operating two business ventures:  a videoke bar and a general store. Her husband Pedro D., who is 39 years old, works as a miner and also helps in his wife's business activities. They have 11 children who are 8 months to 20 years old.  \r\n\r\nMa. Magdalina joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2007 because she wanted something better for her family. With the help of her past eight loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Ma. Magdalina has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 12,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 10,000, thus uplifting the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her ninth loan, she is borrowing PHP 14,000 which she intends to use to expand her business so that she can continue to save up for their future and provide a better life for her children. Ma. Magdalina D. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

Zarefei's husband will use the loan for this purpose which will increase their income and improve the family's situation.\n\nZarefie's husband Kamal appears in the picture here as Zareife, like all Gazans, is very religious and is not comfortable having her picture online.\n\nAbout Shariah-compliant lending:\n \nFATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

In July of 1993, she started selling clothing. Then she helped a neighbor selling perfumes. And starting in 1998, when for one of her daughters' birthday she created some flower arrangements, which were liked by all the guests, and so she was asked to create these products. Little by little, through recommendations of her excellent work, she has become well known in her community.<P>\r\nHowever, right now she has several orders she needs to make, and she does not have enough money or materials to make all of them. This is why Socorro is requesting a loan for US $650, which she is willing to pay in a period of 5 months. With this money Socorro will be able to cover all the orders she has, and save for school expenses.

Through his business, he was able to buy the house in which he and his family live. The business now generates enough income to cover his household expenses. He started working at 14, and by 21 he used his savings to buy machinery and set up his own carpentry shop. The customers from his old work followed him to his new business since he is very good at his trade. He currently has two employees who help him manufacture the furniture.

Bahrom is dedicated to the business of livestock. He distinguishes himself by having a lot of experience when it comes to livestock.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Fatu was born in Kabala and she is approximately forty-three years of age. She is married to a dealer in cigarettes and both of them have four children together. Two of their children are in colleges, one in secondary school and the other in primary school. Fatu sells rice, ground-nut\/peanuts, pepper, beans and palm-oil (the most popular cooking oil).

Every day she attends to her customers from 11:30am until 5pm.  Her vending stall is quite popular because of Rosa\u2019s excellent service and the good seasoning of the dishes she offers.\r\n<p>\r\nThis business enables her to remain active and generate income to support her family.  Her husband works as an assistant at the public university in the area.  With the money from both of their incomes, they are able to pay for their children\u2019s college education.\r\n<p>\r\nBecause of the continuous demand that she experiences, Rosa believes she has to prepare more dishes to offer to her customers.  For this reason, she is requesting her first loan from Edypme Alternativa in the amount of 1000 soles.  She will use the money to purchase supplies to continue preparing her dishes (rice, sugar, beans, oil, and noodles).  \r\n<p>\r\nHer greatest wish is to open a small grocery store in her home so that her family can continue to move forward.  Rosa is well-known and respected by her neighbors.  Her customers view her as a modest hardworking woman.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva

Myrna has been engaged in her business for over 10 years and earns approximately 2500 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Myrna joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Myrna has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5000 PHP from ASKI. Myrna is requesting a new loan of 7000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the second loan taken out by Myrna from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

town of Samana. This area is a nascent tourist zone, surrounded by the Atlantic ocean and mountains, rivers and natural breezes. Ramona says her most important challenge is to raise her children and guide them in a good way. She enjoys the kitchen and cooking.\r\n\r\nRamona is receiving her second loan from Esperanza Internacional, after having successfully repaid her previous loan.

Thi Nguyen joined the Fund in 2007.  Her family lives in a house facing a main street, which is very convenient for running a business.  She first joined the Fund to borrow money to invest in buying fruits to sell; at first she only sold small quantities to serve people in the area.  After one round of funding and seeing that the business had very high profits, she invested more money to expand the store with many more types of fruits.  Her husband buys and brings home the inventory of goods, and she runs the store and sells the fruits.  Besides sales at the store, she also sells to traders who supply the local markets around the area, and also has contracts to supply fruits for family gatherings, events, and ceremonies.  The family\u2019s finances are slowly improving and her is also very happy with their business.  She has two small school-age children.  In this round of funding she is requesting 9,000,000 VND to continue investing in the fruits business.

Previously, Mohamed received a loan of the same amount, Le 3,000,000.00, from Kiva through SMT.  He also used that loan to buy working materials. While the new loan amount remains the same, it will still enable him to make a better profit and consequently improve his living standard. Each time Mohamed makes profit, he reinvests part of the profit into the business and part of it into the house he is currently building."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1025,"image":{"id":213050,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Tailoring","sector":"Services","themes":["Conflict

Asatillo is 37 years old and married with four children. After he received a loan from IMON International, he witnessed an increased harvest for the first time in his life. With the loan, Asatillo expanded his vegetable-growing business. With the additional income from the harvest, Asatillo opened a small kiosk in his house where his family sells different foodstuff. Accordingly, his family\u2019s standard of living has improved. \r\n<p>\r\nNow he is seeking a loan of 2500 Somoni ($675 USD) to expand his farming operations, which will enable him to meet his targets for the coming season and, in turn, to generate additional income. \r\n<p> \r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n<p> \r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and its famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  Today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n<p> \r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war that ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R. further damaged its already weak economy. 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable--conditions that have resulted in high levels of unemployment and forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n<p> \r\nIMON's History\r\n<p> \r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is 58 years old. Leocadia is married and has one adult child. To make a living, Leocadia owns & operates a fish-selling business. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from harvesting & selling ocean-caught fish in the local community. Leocadia is just starting this business.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Leocadia joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Leocadia has successfully repaid a previous loan of 6,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to to purchase fishing equipment including hooks & nets. Leocadia is requesting a new loan of 12000 PHP which will be used to purchase a transport vehicle to improve the business. This loan will be the 3rd loan taken out by Leocadia from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>But Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>IMON's History<\/p>\r\n<p>Since December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It usually begins with table-top selling and then grows to become a kiosk and eventually becomes supermarket. Helena is one of such entrepreneurs who have been trading in groceries like biscuits, bottled water, candies, can foods, rice, cooking oil, toiletries, etc., for the past three years. She sells in a metal store near her community market, hoping that, one day, she will be able to grow her business into a supermarket.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\nIMON's History\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

Occidental. She earns her living by operating 2 business ventures:  fishing and the buying and selling of fish. Sulficia joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1999 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 22 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Sulficia has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 10,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 12,000, thus uplifting the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 23rd cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 20,000, which she intends to use as additional capital for her fishing business, will help her to continue to save up for the future expansion of her business and do home repairs.  Sulficia F. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams.

Pakistan and known for its dairy industry. She lives there with her family in a two-room brick house. She is married to G. M. and has no children.\r\n \r\nShe is a very talented lady who owns and operates her embroidery business at home. Earlier, she did this work to spend her time but later on she took it as a profession and now works on orders which she receives from different shops and from neighboring areas. She enjoys doing this work and earns well from it. Her earnings allow her to share the financial burden with her husband who operates a ready-made garment-selling business. \r\n\r\nHer husband has been dealing with his garment business for the last ten years. He has obtained a good reputation among his clients and serves them with quality clothes. He operates his shop in the market and deals with a good clientele base. \r\n \r\nAnweri has applied for a loan from the Kiva partner, Asasah, for her husband\u2019s business. With the loan, her husband will buy ready-made garments in bulk quantities for his business. The winter season has come and he will buy some winter clothes as well to provide a different variety to his customers. Anweri is hopeful that this investment will put more money in her husband\u2019s pocket and his business will become more profitable for him. \r\n\r\nShe is a regular loan user of Asasah and this is her 3rd loan application. In previous loan years, she has responsibly paid her installments and attended every meeting. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":626460,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"To buy ready-made garments for reselling","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PK","country":"Pakistan","town":"Arifwala","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"30.283333 73.066667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":60,"posted_date":"2010-10-26T12:50:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":475,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Anweri ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dano Bibi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-10-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PKR","disbursal_amount":40000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":3668},{"due_date":"2010-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":3668},{"due_date":"2011-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":3668},{"due_date":"2011-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":3668},{"due_date":"2011-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":3668},{"due_date":"2011-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":3668},{"due_date":"2011-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":3668},{"due_date":"2011-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":3668},{"due_date":"2011-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":3668},{"due_date":"2011-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":3668},{"due_date":"2011-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":3320}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.56},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.56},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.55},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.56},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.56},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.56},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.55},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.56},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.56},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.56},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.42}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":43.56,"local_amount":3668,"processed_date":"2010-11-17T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T13:01:23Z","rounded_local_amount":3739.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182495341},{"amount":43.56,"local_amount":3668,"processed_date":"2010-12-17T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T12:24:03Z","rounded_local_amount":3739.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188630276},{"amount":43.55,"local_amount":3668,"processed_date":"2011-01-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T01:36:27Z","rounded_local_amount":3739.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191373183},{"amount":43.56,"local_amount":3668,"processed_date":"2011-02-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:18:09Z","rounded_local_amount":3739.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195790615},{"amount":43.56,"local_amount":3668,"processed_date":"2011-03-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T10:15:28Z","rounded_local_amount":3739.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201232445},{"amount":43.56,"local_amount":3668,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T10:13:13Z","rounded_local_amount":3739.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206098865},{"amount":43.55,"local_amount":3668,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T10:34:33Z","rounded_local_amount":3739.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211169268},{"amount":43.56,"local_amount":3668,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T10:34:48Z","rounded_local_amount":3739.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216452012},{"amount":43.56,"local_amount":3668,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:17:24Z","rounded_local_amount":3739.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221615967},{"amount":43.56,"local_amount":3668,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T08:28:07Z","rounded_local_amount":3739.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":226985095},{"amount":39.42,"local_amount":3320,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T08:22:33Z","rounded_local_amount":3385.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232743940}],"funded_date":"2010-10-26T23:00:49Z","paid_date":"2011-10-15T08:22:33Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Diane Bird","image":220084}},{"id":246334,"name":"Bester","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":" Bester N.  is currently in the business of selling coffee, cow peas, fish, beans, groundnuts etc  and is requesting a loan to stock more supplies of goods to sell.

Kahramon is a very responsible and optimistic person. He has three children and a wife who he has to support. His father is not working - only S. works in the family and is responsible for feeding them.\r\n\r\nKahramon began his working life in the catering field. His mother baked pies at home and he sold them in order to feed his family. Saving money, he began his business and got married. He has been in the clothing sales business for six years. \r\n\r\nKahramon is currently faced with many problems because as his children grow up, accordingly their expenses are growing too. He would like to get a loan of 11,000 Somoni to buy a place for his business. The only way to get out of this difficulty is to succeed in business, so we hope that his capabilities, along with the services provided by IMON International will help him improve the business.  \r\n\r\n<strong>More about Tajikistan and IMON International<\/strong>\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes and a civilization that dates back to the 4th century BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the USSR, further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

and livestock business three years ago.  Ketut Tantri's husband is only a farmer who does not have enough income, because the land he works is not large.  From this marriage Ketut Tantri has two children but they are already married and live apart from Ketut Tantri.  With starting capital of Rp. 1,600,000, Ketut Tantri bought two sows.  One of them now has twelve children.  Two months after birth those piglets can be sold, and usually one piglet sells for Rp 200,000, but the plan is for five of these to be fattened up, leaving seven to be sold.  The income from the sale will be Rp.1,400,000 (@200,000 x &), of which Rp. 500,000 will be profit, which Ketut Tantri will use to improve her house although it is still very basic (semi-permanent).  Of the loan received from Dinari the plan is to use Rp.1,300,000 to buy feed because Ketut Tantri is now expanding her business to raise and fatten-up five piglets, in addition to the two sows, with the goal of increasing the profits.\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Indonesian by Andrew Goss, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nIbu Ni Ketut Tantri seorang ibu rumah tangga yang sangat ulet dan tekun terbukti untuk membantu perekonomian rumah tangganya Ketut Tantri menjalankan usaha memelihara ternak babi sejak 3 tahun yang lalu. Suami Ketut Tantri hanya sebagai seorang petani yang tidak mempunyai penghasilan cukup,karena ladang yang dikerjakannyapun tidak banyak,dari pernikahannya ini Ketut Tantri mempuyai 2 orang anak namun keduanya kini sudah menikah dan tinggal terpisah dengan Ketut Tantri.Dengan modal awal sebesar Rp.1.600.000 Ketut Tantri membeli 2 ekor babi penginduk. Dan salah satunya sekarang sudah mempunyai anak 12 ekor ,Setelah 2 bulan sejak lahir maka anak babi ini sudah bisa dijual ,Biasanya 1 ekor dijual seharga Rp.200.000,tetapi rencananya anak babi ini akan dipelihara sebagai babi penggemukan,sebanyak 5 ekor dan sisanya 7 ekor baru dijual. Dari hasil penjualan sebesar Rp.1.400.000 (@200.000 x 7) maka diperoleh keuntungan sebesar Rp.500.000 , dari keuntungan inilah Ketut Tantri bisa memperbaiki rumahnya walaupun masih sangat sederhana (semipermanen) . Untuk pinjaman yang diperoleh dari dinari sebesar Rp.1.300.000 rencananya akan dipergunakan untuk membeli pakan ternak karena KetutTantri sekarang menambah usahanya dengan memelihara 5 ekor penggemukan disamping 2 ekor penginduk tadi,dengan harapan keuntungan yang diperoleh lebih meningkat."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":150,"image":{"id":71717,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Buy livestock feed - Membeli pakan ternak","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Melaya, Bali","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":82,"posted_date":"2007-10-09T05:30:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":150,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ni Ketut Tantri","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-10-23T05:57:55Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":150,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2007-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":25}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":25,"local_amount":25,"processed_date":"2007-11-23T10:21:22Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-23T09:27:14Z","rounded_local_amount":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":85550},{"amount":25,"local_amount":25,"processed_date":"2007-12-21T01:36:48Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-23T09:27:14Z","rounded_local_amount":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":100241},{"amount":25,"local_amount":25,"processed_date":"2008-01-21T07:10:29Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-23T09:27:14Z","rounded_local_amount":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":119042},{"amount":25,"local_amount":25,"processed_date":"2008-02-20T01:16:37Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-23T09:27:14Z","rounded_local_amount":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":138501},{"amount":25,"local_amount":25,"processed_date":"2008-03-23T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-23T09:27:14Z","rounded_local_amount":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":164261},{"amount":25,"local_amount":25,"processed_date":"2008-04-23T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-23T09:27:14Z","rounded_local_amount":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":189316}],"funded_date":"2007-10-09T05:57:55Z","paid_date":"2008-04-23T09:05:03Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":24247,"name":"Genoveva","description":{"languages":["es"],"texts":{"es":"Genoveva is 49 years old, married to Sixto Zarate, and they have 8 children: 7 are married and working while the youngest studies in school. <p>\r\n\r\nPreviously she worked in a tailor shop and with the time and experience she gained there, she opened her own tailor shop.

She earns income breeding pigs, while her husband, Mr. Em Lok, works as a motorbike-taxi driver, make very little. Mrs. S.'s business, on the other hand, is going well, and she wants to expand it. Therefore, Mrs. S. is asking for a loan to buy additional piglets for breeding. \r\nThis is a group loan mainly consisting of end-of-term loans. Three members of the group have end-of-term loans, while the others have monthly payment loans. They are not required to pay any principal on the loan until the very end of the loan term. End-of-term (EoT) loans are AMK\u2019s main product, because it is the most beneficial to Cambodia\u2019s poor, allowing them to repay portions of the principal whenever they are financially able to. Most clients start to make payments many months before the end of the loan term, and almost all of AMK\u2019s clients make their payments on time.

At 37 years old, she still has great desire to continue working and helping her family. She lives in a house that was left to her by her parents. Zonia has one of the most well-stocked stores in her neighborhood. Her humble shop offers the groceries and household supplies most requested by the local population. She has had her shop for eight years and is very happy to sell products that meet the demands of her customers. The most difficult thing about her work is staying in her shop all day without being able to leave, as her store is open all day and she must be available to serve her customers whenever they call. In the future, Zonia would like to expand her business to provide more products, as her neighborhood is growing and her current supply of merchandise is not enough.\r\n<p>\r\nThis is Zonia's fifth loan from Microfinanzas PRISMA, and all of her previous loan were repaid punctually and without problems.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

This way her earnings will grow, and she will get more customers because she will have what it takes to cover their necessities.  \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":383411,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Invest in her business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":18,"posted_date":"2009-09-05T16:20:12Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":725,"lender_count":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ana Hortencia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-09-04T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":9500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":950},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":950},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":950},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":950},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":950},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":950},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":950},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":950},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":950},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":950}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.5},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.5},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.5},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.5},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.5},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.5},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.5},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.5},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.5},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":72.5,"local_amount":950,"processed_date":"2009-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T21:48:58Z","rounded_local_amount":981.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96950160},{"amount":72.5,"local_amount":950,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T12:35:57Z","rounded_local_amount":981.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103792305},{"amount":72.5,"local_amount":950,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T13:37:19Z","rounded_local_amount":981.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110683033},{"amount":72.5,"local_amount":950,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:36:05Z","rounded_local_amount":981.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118077607},{"amount":72.5,"local_amount":950,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:10:14Z","rounded_local_amount":981.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123913849},{"amount":72.5,"local_amount":950,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:01:20Z","rounded_local_amount":981.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128949512},{"amount":72.5,"local_amount":950,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:33:43Z","rounded_local_amount":981.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136678357},{"amount":72.5,"local_amount":950,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:19:22Z","rounded_local_amount":981.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144712797},{"amount":72.5,"local_amount":950,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-16T07:40:40Z","rounded_local_amount":981.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":152048141},{"amount":72.5,"local_amount":950,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:12:35Z","rounded_local_amount":981.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159636700}],"funded_date":"2009-09-09T01:09:41Z","paid_date":"2010-08-15T11:12:35Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ginny Kalish"}},{"id":139011,"name":"Bukorakole Nyangoma Beatrice Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"N.

Durante toda su vida ha trabajado en diversidad de labores, pero hace 3 a\u00f1os decidi\u00f3 incursionar en un negocio que le diera la ventaja de ser independiente. Es as\u00ed que explotando sus habilidades culinarias, que es lo que su familia siempre ha alabado, en asociaci\u00f3n con una amiga implement\u00f3 dos puestos de comida en una de las calles m\u00e1s concurridas de su localidad. Ahora, Ana viene obteniendo buenos ingresos realizando una actividad que le gusta mucho y tiene en mente para el futuro tener un restaurante donde ofrezca con mayor comodidad sus ricos platillos, ya que actualmente tiene dificultades de espacio, pues sus puestos son muy concurridos.

The inspiration of maintaining her excellent performance in ASHI since the time of her membership is drawn from the four most significant blessing she received from GOD. These are her four children whose age ranges are from 10 to 20 years old.  Despite of poverty and small family income, Ana and her family give love and respect to each other. While her husband manages and working in their small business which is a vehicle (particularly motorcycle) repair shop, at home Ana does the household chores and is taking care of their children. \r\n\r\nAs her children grew old their family expenses also increases hence, Ana and her husband wanted to enhance their small business through a loan for a capital. Because Ana and her husband are just poor, no one in their village would trust them for a loan. With that, Ana joined ASHI and had found the answer to her problem. Since then, she made her business grow anyhow but not yet to the extent of achieving her dream of making it sustainable. Ana and her husband still want to buy more equipments and machines necessary for the business to improve their efficiency, to improve the quality of service they can give and be able to have more costumers. Therefore she still asks for a much larger amount of loan for its fulfillment.

She shares her life with her husband, Ivan, 65, and they live together in their own home. Since they were both very young the couple has worked selling artesanal goods, an activity that their 2 children have inherited, having now established their own stall and working at the same activity. The most frequent work Consuela and Ivan do is making very large statues of saints for Christmas and for churches and chapels. Apart from this, Consuela also has her own business selling small statues of the baby Jesus, which she sells by order. This is less work because of the statues' size, but this doesn't mean it's less difficult as the statues are very detailed - putting in place the mix into the moulds and closing them with great precision so that both sides are in harmony and the image is modelled well. Later the moulds are sculpted and given the finishing touches necessary. This is the couple's third loan with MFP, and as usual they will be very punctual with the repayments. With this loan they will purchase the materials necessary to finish the orders that they have waiting. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jane McCrory, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":558093,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"Purchase material to make statues to fill an order ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:35Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Consuela ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-06-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":123.59},{"due_date":"2010-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":130.56},{"due_date":"2010-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":134.09},{"due_date":"2010-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":141.15},{"due_date":"2010-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":145.48},{"due_date":"2010-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":152.61},{"due_date":"2011-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":157.81},{"due_date":"2011-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":165.03},{"due_date":"2011-03-11T08:00:00Z","amount":172.1},{"due_date":"2011-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":177.58}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.32},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.87},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.16},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.76},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.34},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.96},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.86},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.51},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.11},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.11}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":47.23,"local_amount":128.82,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:36:44Z","rounded_local_amount":133.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159673485},{"amount":47.95,"local_amount":130.77,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:40:07Z","rounded_local_amount":135.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166887304},{"amount":48.66,"local_amount":132.72,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:25:50Z","rounded_local_amount":137.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172154315},{"amount":51.85,"local_amount":141.4,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T15:13:19Z","rounded_local_amount":146.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177449613},{"amount":52.93,"local_amount":144.35,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:01:23Z","rounded_local_amount":149.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182588314},{"amount":56.82,"local_amount":154.97,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T14:03:33Z","rounded_local_amount":160.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188724816},{"amount":244.56,"local_amount":666.97,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T04:39:26Z","rounded_local_amount":691.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191463005}],"funded_date":"2010-07-03T01:47:38Z","paid_date":"2011-02-16T04:39:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jane McCrory","image":240040}},{"id":213565,"name":"Julio Alberto","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Julio Alberto tiene 52 a\u00f1os de edad, reside en el Municipio de Chilanga del departamento de Moraz\u00e1n, es acompa\u00f1ado tiene dos hijos, y actualmente vive solo con su compa\u00f1era de vida, el se dedica a la venta de CD.\nTiene siete a\u00f1os de dedicarse a la venta de CD de m\u00fasica, y los comercializa en los municipios y zonas cercanas de su residencia, emprendi\u00f3 su negocio por la necesidad econ\u00f3mica y la falta de empleo.\nJulio est\u00e1 solicitando un pr\u00e9stamo para la compra de CD, y seguir con su negocio  ya que de las ventas depende la econom\u00eda de su familia, sus aspiraciones son tener un lugar propio donde vivir, ahorrar para comprar un terreno.\n","en":"Julio Alberto is 52 years old.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.
