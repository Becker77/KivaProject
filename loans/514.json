It is comprised of 17 members, who are very hard workers. They sell kerosene, gasoline, and diesel fuel, the sale of pots, skirts, food, jewelry, making jackets, and selling beds and batteries. In the case of Don Lino, who is the only man in the group, he builds housing and also sells auto parts in the Fair of July 16th. In the market where the members work, there is a good deal of competition. In spite of that, the members value the speed that they have to change and supply their merchandise in accordance with the demands of a given time period. This credit is destined principally for the increase of working capital, for buying foods, and for buying materials to expand their activities. The majority of the members have experience with loans, given that this is not their first time working with Fundaci\u00f3n Agrocapital in which they demonstrated responsibility and got along with the institution. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Matt Capetola, Kiva

Since her childhood she grew bananas and hot peppers, but when she formed a family, she became a trader of hot peppers and cayhuas (local peppers), which resulted in a highly profitable undertaking. She ships her products to the capital city of her region and to Lima, and within three days her customers transfer the money through the banking system. Marta likes to take care of her crops and her business, because her income from it allows her to offer a good education to her children.

After successfully graduating from one of the prestigious universities of the Soviet Union, Kyrgyz National University, she worked as an accountant for more years than she could have imagined that she would. She was suddenly let go in 2004. The way she displayed courage was something unimaginable. Because an ambitious mind wants success, she was able to confront that situation. Thanks to God, she had studied well, because she started a little business which soon turned into big one. \r\n\r\nFor 8,000 KGS ($178) she bought a cow. Selling milk didn't contribute enough to the family's budget, so they borrowed money from relatives to buy livestock. They bought bull calves, so that after fattening them they could sell them. Her revenue was about 500 KGS ($12). In the meantime, life went on and now she is fifty-four years old. She has married and has a brilliant husband who works as a teacher. In his free time he helps her with her business. Also she has two children; a daughter and a son. Her daughter is already married and now lives separately, and her son is a student. She is planning to increase the number of calves and provide education for her son as well. She wants a loan to buy bull calves for reselling after fattening. \r\n\r\nGulzada K. is thirty-eight years old and is married. Her husband takes across passengers. They have six children, the elder one studying in the university, the rest attending local schools.  Ten years ago she successfully opened up a business by selling their bull calf for 20,000 KGS ($445). She sells housewares. Her revenue per month is about 15,000 KGS ($334). They already have bought a house, and have built a shop and a shed. She wants a loan to buy more housewares to sell.\r\n\r\nOrozkul H. is a married woman. She is twenty-six years old and has two children who are at home with her. Her husband works on projects sometimes and also resells sheep in the farmyard. Three years ago they started their business with 5,000 KGS ($112) and now their profit per month is about 3,000 KGS ($65).

The official name of this borrowing group is 08.1.1 Nam Ng\u1ea1n.\r\n\r\nHanh is married and has two adult-aged children. To make a living, Hanh owns and operates a business venture in the retail sector running a general store.

Hanh has been engaged in this business for over seven years and earns approximately 2,000,000 VND a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Hanh joined Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Hanh has successfully repaid a previous loan of 3,079,800 VND from Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. She is now requesting a new loan of 6,000,000 VND which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. The loan will be the fourth loan taken out by the borrower from Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women.

Desde muy peque\u00f1a sus padres le ense\u00f1aron esta labor y ahora ella tiene sus propias tierras en las que trabaja junto a su pareja, que con mucho esmero siembran flores como por ejemplo rosas, crisantemos, claveles y otras flores. Lo que m\u00e1s le gusta de su trabajo es cosechar sus tierras, ya que as\u00ed siente que su arduo trabajo ha sido de mucho provecho. Lleva varios a\u00f1os realizando esta actividad y considera que lo m\u00e1s dif\u00edcil es transportar sus cultivos hasta los centros de acopio situados en las ciudades de Urubamba y Cusco. Martha solicita el pr\u00e9stamo para realizar unos de sus planes, que es extender la siembra de flores, por ser una de sus plantas que mayor precio tiene en el mercado. Con el tiempo, espera juntar el dinero suficiente para abrir una maderera. Ella tiene la obligaci\u00f3n de pagar sus aportes puntualmente y est\u00e1 dispuesta a hacerlo si desea acceder a otro cr\u00e9dito. Agradece a la instituci\u00f3n por concederle el pr\u00e9stamo. Con los 1,200 nuevos soles, comprar\u00e1 semillas y as\u00ed aumentar su producci\u00f3n.","en":"Martha was born in Quillabamba (Cusco, Peru). She is 40 years old and she is a very happy and hardworking woman. She lives in a house which she owns together with her partner Isaac and their only son. He is the motivation for all of their efforts. The green fields of the community of Chichubamba, located in Valle Sagrado de los Incas, is where Martha currently lives and in life it has been a most pleasant place for her to work. \r\n\r\nWhen she was very young her parents taught her this business and today she has her own fields where she works together with her partner. With a great deal of care they cultivate flowers, such as roses, chrysanthemums, carnations, and other flowers. what she most enjoys about her work is to harvest the fields because this is when she feels that her arduous work has been a great investment. She has been in the business for several years and she considers the most difficult part to be the transportation of the harvest to the collection centers in the cities of Urubamba and Cusco. Martha requests a loan to carry out one of her plans, which is to extend her flower plantation because her plants obtain the best price in the market. With time she hopes to save enough money to start a lumber yard. She has the obligation to make her payments on time and she is ready to do so if she wants to have another loan. She is thankful to the organization for granting her this loan. With the 1200 nuevos soles she will purchase seeds to increase production.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":771223,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Flowers","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase seeds to increase production.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Urubamba - Urubamba - Cusco","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":119,"posted_date":"2011-05-19T18:00:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":450,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":" Martha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-05-09T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1200,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":181.28},{"due_date":"2011-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":188.48},{"due_date":"2011-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":195.95},{"due_date":"2011-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":203.72},{"due_date":"2011-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":211.81},{"due_date":"2011-11-05T07:00:00Z","amount":218.76}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.98},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.68},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.48},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.4},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.43},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":82.03}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":67.98,"local_amount":181.28,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T10:37:12Z","rounded_local_amount":187.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216455820},{"amount":70.68,"local_amount":188.48,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:19:58Z","rounded_local_amount":194.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221619467},{"amount":73.48,"local_amount":195.95,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T08:30:54Z","rounded_local_amount":202.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":226988256},{"amount":76.4,"local_amount":203.72,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T08:25:13Z","rounded_local_amount":210.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232746956},{"amount":79.43,"local_amount":211.81,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T09:27:13Z","rounded_local_amount":218.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238551164},{"amount":82.03,"local_amount":218.76,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:20:13Z","rounded_local_amount":226.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244510118}],"funded_date":"2011-05-19T20:43:13Z","paid_date":"2011-12-15T09:20:13Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":303331,"name":"Zephaniah","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Zephaniah is 30 years old, married, and the father of two.

Some roll the threads into a ball, others separate and others dye until they go to high school or the university.  With the loans she has received, she has been able to expand the business.  Before she had capital, she could only weave from 5 to 10 <em>mantas<\/em>.  Now she weaves 30 to 40 <em>mantas<\/em> and brings them to the large markets.  At the <em>Bancomunal<\/em>, Maximiliana has received workshops that have helped her greatly.  She serves on the executive board as the finance officer.  She considers herself to be very punctual and has learned how to save money.  Maximiliana needs a loan to buy an additional loom.  Her dream is to own a big business with 30 looms.  She is saving to buy a mending machine.\r\n<p>\r\nIsabel A. is married with 5 children between the ages of 4 and 14.  Isabel began her business selling sweets in the school. Thanks to an inicial loan she received from FINCA, she opened a cafeteria in the school where the teachers and nurses take their meals.  Isabel learned to cook and believes this opened her up to a big opportunity.\r\nShe has had difficulties in her life.  She was operated on for an ovarian cyst and spent time in recovery.  Her husband helped her, but it wasn't the same and the clientele decreased.  Isabel is president of the mothers' club in her community.  She thanks FINCA because she has learned many things such as how to direct people, do business with them and see the necessities of her group.  Isabel tells us that she has changed as a person.  She is going to invest her loan by purchasing dried vegetables and bringing them to Lima, the capital.  Her dream is that her children receive a higher education.  She is going to save so that her five children can study.\r\n<p>\r\nTeresa C. is married and has 7 children.  She began her business selling cheese from a pail in the streets. \r\nThanks to the arrival of FINCA Peru to her town, she was able to receive a loan and buy more cheese.  Other groups asked for many things and certifications while all she had was her small adobe house and some cattle.  She has faced difficulties in her life, such as the death of her 27-year-old son.  Her grandchildren were left alone and she has to work hard to take care of them.  Teresa received workshops on how to save money.  Before she was very quiet, now she knows how to express herself.  Her dream is to buy a car.  With the credit she received from FINCA she will buy more cheese and also eggs to sell.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Priya Bapat, Kiva

He breeds calves, cows and sheep. He is married and has a daughter of 17 whom he needs to support and properly educate. Muhammadjon has improved his financial situation because he has been able to wisely use the loans he has received from IMON International to breed his animals. Nowadays, his biggest dream is to expand his business and to also offer animal derivates (as dairy products) in the surroundings of his community. Therefore, his biggest need is to get a loan in order to buy more cows.  \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International:\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and with its famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists, and poets such as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New Western culture and Central Asian traditions. But, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

A. want to invest her profits and this loan in medicines to sell.\r\nThe loan will help her community because drugs will be accessible to the sick and the health of the community will improve. Also, money circulation will increase in her community. She believes the business will succeed because she does not have many competitors and her capital has increased.\r\n\r\nA. will use the profit to increase her capital, pay fees for the children, and buy food for her home.\r\nShe prefers GHAPE loans because they are simple to pay off, and she appreciates the management techniques that GHAPE teaches their clients.\r\n\r\nAbout GHAPE \r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon.  GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach.

It's characterized as a rural, sparsely populated zone that belongs to Lambayeque province, located an hour from Chiclayo city.\r\n\r\nRosa buys, raises and sells small livestock. She has done this for the past 6 years. After raising the animals she sells them in the Lambayeque market and sometims to visiting dealers. She usually raises sheep and poultry. This work is her most stable source of income, since her husband is a seasonal farm worker.  \r\n\r\nShe will keep working to help her husband and to provide her family with the opportunity to improve itself. It is for her family's sake that she hopes to expand her business by purchasing more animals and enriched feed, thus increasing sales. To reach her goal, Rosa has applied for a 1,500 PEN loan from Edpyme Alternativa.\r\n\r\nRosa has previously worked with Kiva and she is very grateful to the people who helped her grow as an entrepreneur. Rosa continues to work hard towards her biggest dream: to provide her children with the opportunity to advance in the future.

SaL. started a business renting laundry machines. In 2007 she sought to strengthen her business with a loan from the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation, as she was unable to meet customer demand with the two washing machines her husband had bought for that purpose.\r\n\r\nShe began her business to satisfy the needs of housewives regarding the reduction in effort and time savings of this tiring daily chore, particularly given the unrelenting sun of the Caribbean Coast where Elsy lives.\r\n\r\nShe has a tricycle she uses to transport her machines, a task in which she is assisted by her eldest daughter. With the income generated by this activity Elsy has been pursuing studies as a nursing assistant, perfected through graduate studies and updates, such as neonatal care and many other subjects.\r\n\r\nHer family consists of her husband, employed by a company, and their two daughters aged 15 and 10 years who are still in school. She dreams of seeing them become successful in their future careers.\r\n\r\nThis is the second loan granted by the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation, an organisation that provided strong support, as it bolstered her working capital which contributed to Elsy\u2019s personal development as the business grew.\r\n\r\nUsing her Kiva loan she will buy two more washing machines to replace the ones bought previously, which have deteriorated to the point where they can no longer withstand the daily grind. \r\n\r\nAt 33 years of age, Elsy and her family are progressing in the same direction. While she and her husband work, their daughters study and help with the business and household tasks, so that one day they can have more opportunities for a successful life.\r\n\r\nHer main challenge is the limited working capital she depends on and that is needed for her business to continue moving forward.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":625265,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Machinery Rental","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"buy two more washing machines","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Corregimiento la Playa-Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2010-11-01T07:20:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":450,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elsy ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-10-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":800000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":69737},{"due_date":"2011-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":75344},{"due_date":"2011-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":76600},{"due_date":"2011-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":77876},{"due_date":"2011-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":79174},{"due_date":"2011-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":80494},{"due_date":"2011-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":81835},{"due_date":"2011-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":83199},{"due_date":"2011-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":84586},{"due_date":"2011-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":91155}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39.23},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.38},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.09},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.8},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.54},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.27},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.04},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.8},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.58},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.27}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":39.23,"local_amount":69737,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T14:08:48Z","rounded_local_amount":71255.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182550804},{"amount":42.38,"local_amount":75344,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T13:14:25Z","rounded_local_amount":76985.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188688416},{"amount":43.09,"local_amount":76600,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-17T09:26:25Z","rounded_local_amount":78268.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191427633},{"amount":43.81,"local_amount":77876,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-16T08:40:41Z","rounded_local_amount":79572.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":196001052},{"amount":44.54,"local_amount":79174,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:08:13Z","rounded_local_amount":80898.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201289063},{"amount":45.28,"local_amount":80494,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:04:07Z","rounded_local_amount":82247.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206157214},{"amount":46.03,"local_amount":81835,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:18:34Z","rounded_local_amount":83617.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211230219},{"amount":46.8,"local_amount":83199,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:08:44Z","rounded_local_amount":85011.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216509091},{"amount":47.58,"local_amount":84586,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:49:48Z","rounded_local_amount":86428.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221673319},{"amount":51.26,"local_amount":91155,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-17T08:01:51Z","rounded_local_amount":93140.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227319881}],"funded_date":"2010-11-01T13:30:32Z","paid_date":"2011-09-17T08:01:51Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ren\u00e9 McConnell","image":467423}},{"id":245978,"name":"Esther","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Esther G., age 35, sells a variety of different items in her general store.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New Western culture and Central Asian traditions. But, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Since her  chicken-breeding business is doing well, she wants to expand it by purchasing more chickens and chicken feed to earn more income to support her family. Her husband, Mr. Mak Thy, is a construction worker. Mrs. Vanny S. is 38 years old and the mother of five children, two of whom stay at home to do housework and help the parents work while the others are enrolled in the local school.\r\n\r\nThis is a village bank loan consisting of mainly end-of-term loans. Eight members have end-of-term loans and the rest have monthly payment loans. Group members are not required to pay any principal on the loan until the very end of the loan term. End-of-term (EoT) loans are AMK\u2019s main product because it is the most beneficial to Cambodia\u2019s poor. It allows them to repay portions of the principal whenever they are financially able to. Most clients start to make payments many months before the end of the loan term. Almost all of AMK\u2019s clients make their payments on time.

She is 37 years old. Rebecca is married and has three adult children. To make a living, Rebecca owns and operates a specialized retail store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling daily-use products such as sardines, salt, sugar, noodles, coffee, shampoo, soap and toothpaste in the local community. Rebecca has been engaged in her business for over two years and earns approximately 8000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Rebecca joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. Rebecca has successfully repaid a previous loan of 4000 PHP from GDMPC. This previous loan was used to purchase additional inventory and working capital. Rebecca is requesting a new loan of 4000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the second loan taken out by Rebecca from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement the family's income. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three unit offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fishers and small-business entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She will also hire a master builder to repair a leak in the roof and paint part of her outdoor area.  Sonia's dream is to build a second floor with more rooms to rent out.  Her motivation is to financially help her three daughters and grandchildren to whom she feels very committed, even though they no longer live with her.\r\n\r\nSonia's previous loans from Fondo Esperanza have been very useful.  It has been useful for her to be able to rely on this capital.  The training sessions have also helped her to organize her expenses.

We feel it is worth pointing out that this region is home to 50% of the Mapuches (indigenous people) in our country.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":695584,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"To buy five doors and pay for repairs","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CL","country":"Chile","town":"Temuco","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-30 -71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":157,"posted_date":"2011-01-19T15:20:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sonia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-01-19T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"CLP","disbursal_amount":258378,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27458},{"due_date":"2011-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":27575},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27934},{"due_date":"2011-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":28298},{"due_date":"2011-03-29T07:00:00Z","amount":28667},{"due_date":"2011-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":29040},{"due_date":"2011-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":29418},{"due_date":"2011-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":29801},{"due_date":"2011-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":30187}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.7},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.46},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.24},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.02},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.81},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.63},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.43},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.26}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":117.15,"local_amount":55033,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T08:38:24Z","rounded_local_amount":57571.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195839735},{"amount":180.72,"local_amount":84899,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T10:59:47Z","rounded_local_amount":88815.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201282227},{"amount":124.44,"local_amount":58458,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T10:56:35Z","rounded_local_amount":61154.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206150234},{"amount":127.69,"local_amount":59988,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:11:11Z","rounded_local_amount":62755.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211223318}],"funded_date":"2011-01-19T17:05:24Z","paid_date":"2011-06-15T11:11:11Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Oxnard","image":null}},{"id":270577,"name":"Ruslana","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ruslana is divorced.

Danilse is married and has two children, aged 21 and 23, who she dreams of seeing prosper and succeed.\r\n\r\nDanilse started her business in 1991, when she got married, so that she could attend to her family obligations whilst making income.  She started out with a simple sewing machine, an overlock machine and a 'recubridora' (a special machine used for hemming).  She then added two flat machines and, through the loans that she has received from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, she has also managed to add an embroidery machine.  In addition, she has increased her working capital, completely paid off her house and thereby improved her family's well-being.\r\n\r\nThis Kiva loan is Danilse's 19th loan.  She plans to use it to buy material for making men's pants and shirts ordered by her new customers.

She is married and has four children, all of whom are in school. Florence lives in a home that she rents; she has access to electricity but no piped water. Her major monthly expenses include rent, school fees and food for the family.\r\n<br>Florence has a food stall business. She has been in this business for five years, and she works six days a week. Florence sells her products at the market, by means of wholesale\/retail.

They have no children and live together in the house that they own.  For 16 years, along with Yolanda, Jose has made a living selling grocery products.  The business is located in one of the markets in their neighborhood.  The work is fairly easy because the experience of so many years has taught them what their customers want and what products they have to stock to satisfy demand.  Unfortunately, they can't stock all of their products at the market because thieves sometimes break in there at night and steal whatever they find.  Consequently, they keep most of their products at their house and only leave at the business what they have to.  They hope to improve the security of their market stall in the future, as well as improve the incomes they pull from the business.

D. has been engaged in this business for over 6 years and earns approximately 4.200.000 VND a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2007 D. joined SEDA to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. D. has successfully repaid a previous loan of 6.048.000 VND from SEDA.  This previous loan was used to purchase raw materials to manufacture additional products. D. is now requesting a new loan of 8.288.000 VND which will be used to purchase raw materials to manufacture additional products. The loan will be the fifth loan taken out by the borrower through SEDA. D. plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business.\r\n\r\nAbout SEDA:\r\n\r\nThe mission of SEDA (Center of Small Enterprise Development Assistance) is to provide microfinance services to low income and disadvantaged people in rural areas of Hanoi and the Northern provinces of Vietnam.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in Vietnamese while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\r\n\r\nD.

She is 35 years old. Jesselyn is married and has seven school-aged children. To make a living, Jesselyn runs a general store. The main source of income for the business comes from selling a variety of different products in the local community. She has been engaged in her business for more than 18 years now. Her husband is a fisherman and she helps him sell his catch to their community. She also hopes for her husband's fishing business to grow.\r\n\r\nJesselyn joined CEVI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Jesselyn is requesting a new loan of 5,000 Philippine pesos, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell and to buy fishing equipment. This will be the first loan taken out by Jesselyn from CEVI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve her business and the living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\n<b>About CEVI:<\/b>\r\n\r\nCommunity Economic Ventures, Inc (CEVI) has increased its portfolio significantly over the recent years.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

is 72 years old, widowed and mother of seven aged between 32-52 yrs. She has been practising mixed farming for over 30 years. She produces maize, tea, coffee, sugarcane, and milk, which she sells locally. She has one employee. \r\n\r\nShe has requested this loan of Kshs. 45,000 from Juhudi Kilimo to buy a dairy cow.

Usaha ini sudah ditekuni sejak 2 tahun lalu. Pekerjaan ini diambilnya karena ia ingin meningkatkan perekonomian keluarganya sehingga ia akan mampu membiayai pendidikan anaknya setinggi mungkin. Tinggal di lingkungan pedesaan, sebagian besar kaum wanitanya mempunyai usaha beternak babi. Salah satu pakan yang sangat dibutuhkan adalah dedak padi. Melihat peluang ini, I Komang Dera memberanikan diri untuk membuka usaha jual beli dedak padi dirumahnya. Dengan modal tabungannya, I Komang Dera membeli dedak padi di penggilingan padi dan menjualnya kembali ke ibu \u2013 ibu di desanya.\r\nKarena harga yang bersaing dan kwalitas dedak yang baik, I Komang Dera mampu menjual dedak padi sebanyak 1 tons per minggu dengan harga beli per kilogramnya adalah Rp. 1.500.- dan dijual kembali dengan harga Rp. 1.600.- Jadi dalam seminggu ia bisa mendapatkan keuntungan Rp. 100.000.- Semua keuntungan itu ia pergunakan untuk kebutuhan keluarganya sehari \u2013 hari dan juga ditabung untuk persiapan biaya pendidikan anaknya.\r\nI Komang Dera ingin meningkatkan usaha agar lebih maju lagi. Ia memerlukan pinjaman dana untuk dapat membeli lebih banyak lagi dedak padi sehingga ia bisa meningkatkan keuntungannya.

in Kandal province, and they are seeking a loan for various business purposes. <p>\r\n\r\nMr. Phearak P. is the group's leader. He is a 23-year-old fisherman who is unable to catch fish because he does not have enough fishing equipment. To address this problem, Mr. Phearak P. is seeking a loan to buy a new boat and fish nets to re-start his business. His wife, Mrs. Chhoeurn Nary, is employed in a garment factory, and she earns a small salary to support their household. They have a 1-year-old child who is too young to work or study. <p>\r\n\r\nIn practice, this is a group loan, but the loans are structured in two ways: four members are seeking end-of-term loans, while the rest of the group's members would like monthly payment loans. With respect to the end-of-term loans, the borrowers are not required to repay any principal on the loan until the very end of the loan term. Notably, end-of-term loans are AMK's main product because they are the most beneficial to Cambodia's poor population. Specifically, such loans allow borrowers to repay portions of the principal whenever they are financially able to do so. Even so, most clients start to make payments many months before the end of the loan term, and nearly all of AMK's clients make their payments on time. In fact, AMK has a delinquency rate of only 0.09%, and AMK has a default rate of 0% on Kiva loans.

What he enjoys most about his work is the direct contact he has with his passengers. His business is profitable because he is the driver and there is no need to pay an additional salary. This is his second loan with IMON International. Djahongir has proven himself to be punctual in his loan repayments. He will use the loan to buy one more minivan and will give his old minivan to his brother. In that way Djahongir will be able to improve the living conditions of his large family which includes his wife, children, parents and brother.\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and its famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the fourth  millennium BC.  Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve the agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Additionally, she is considering purchasing a permanent post in the market from which to sell her goods rather than conducting her business from home.\r\n<p>\r\nSusana and her husband have four children, aged 17, 15, 13 and 4.

Now, thanks to the good income he has earned, he was able to install telephone booths and stock general goods. He works everyday, Monday to Sunday, selling rice, tuna, oils, telephone services, etc.\r\n\r\nWith this loan he wants to buy shoes, clothing, and make-up to better stock his business. In the future he wants to start other branches of his business and thus be able to buy a car for his family.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Vivian Lu, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":467556,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Shoes, clothing, rice","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Guayaquil (Paraiso)","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":147,"posted_date":"2010-01-11T17:10:14Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"M\u00e1ximo Primitivo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-01-07T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":73.47},{"due_date":"2010-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":75.98},{"due_date":"2010-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":75.63},{"due_date":"2010-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":78.19},{"due_date":"2010-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":79.54},{"due_date":"2010-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":82.07},{"due_date":"2010-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":83.65},{"due_date":"2010-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":85.78},{"due_date":"2010-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":88.26},{"due_date":"2010-11-05T07:00:00Z","amount":90.21},{"due_date":"2010-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":92.66},{"due_date":"2011-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":94.56}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.47},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.98},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.63},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.19},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.54},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.07},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.65},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.78},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":88.26},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":90.21},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":92.66},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":94.56}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":73.47,"local_amount":73.47,"processed_date":"2010-02-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:07:03Z","rounded_local_amount":73.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123910088},{"amount":75.98,"local_amount":75.98,"processed_date":"2010-03-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T08:59:56Z","rounded_local_amount":75.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128945653},{"amount":153.82,"local_amount":153.82,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:17:53Z","rounded_local_amount":153.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136674016},{"amount":161.61,"local_amount":161.61,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:46:19Z","rounded_local_amount":161.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151891376},{"amount":83.65,"local_amount":83.65,"processed_date":"2010-08-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:14:04Z","rounded_local_amount":83.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166845528},{"amount":85.78,"local_amount":85.78,"processed_date":"2010-09-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:06:00Z","rounded_local_amount":85.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172111820},{"amount":88.26,"local_amount":88.26,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T13:55:28Z","rounded_local_amount":88.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177405238},{"amount":90.21,"local_amount":90.21,"processed_date":"2010-11-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T14:04:01Z","rounded_local_amount":90.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182543735},{"amount":92.66,"local_amount":92.66,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T13:08:57Z","rounded_local_amount":92.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188680514},{"amount":94.56,"local_amount":94.56,"processed_date":"2011-01-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T01:43:44Z","rounded_local_amount":94.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191378874}],"funded_date":"2010-01-15T20:28:16Z","paid_date":"2011-02-16T01:43:44Z","journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Vivian Lu","image":225936}},{"id":171719,"name":"Money Tree Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Marie C. is a leader of a group of five borrowers called Money Tree Group.

They have six children ranging in age from 12 to 34 years old. <p>\r\n\r\nMerceditha joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2003 because she aspired to something better for her family.

To make a living, H. owns and operates a business raising pigs for sale.

H. has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,600,000 VND from SEDA.  This previous loan was used to purchase feed and other supplies.\r\n\r\nH. is now requesting a new loan of 8,288,000 VND which will be used to purchase baby pigs to raise and sell in future.  The loan will be the 5th loan taken out by her from SEDA.

C. is a widow who lives in Prk. Malipayon, Tabugon, Kabankalan City, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating a buy & sell livestock business. She has three children who are 16 to 20 years old. Procy joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2008 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past four loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Procy has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 9,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 4,000, thus improving the family's standard of living. This time, for her fifth loan, she is borrowing PHP 12,000, which she intends to use as additional working capital so that she can continue to save up for future family expenses & the education of her children.  Procy C. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, Western culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. Civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients have a solid business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.
