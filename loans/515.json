That is where he lives in his own house with his family, his wife and his two daughters that he loves a lot.\r\n\r\nWhen he was a very young boy his parents taught him how to work the land.  He liked seeing how the plants grew and matured.  His 20 years of experience helped him to obtain many things like the house in which he now very happily lives.\r\n\r\nHe now grows potatoes and peas on land that he rents in the village of Jachapata.  He spends most of his day there.  He needs to take care of his crops so that do not have insect infestations, which at this time continue to plaque his crops.   \r\n\r\nViviano has set a goal for this year.  It is to get together money to be able to buy his own land in Llanco and to spend more time with his family.  He now needs very little.  The last pea harvest yielded 40 sacks, which provided him with good earnings and is allowing him to save for the future.\r\n\r\nHe is grateful for the support of his communal bank because they taught him how to get ahead in spite of the difficulties.  \u201cI work constantly in order to be able to provide my children with a better quality of life,\u201d he says proudly.  He finishes by saying, \u201cI invest most of my earnings in them.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe belongs to the Los \u00c1ngeles de Llanco Communal Bank.  This is his eighth loan with MFP.  He hopes to have their collaboration in order to meet his objectives.  He pledges, once more, to make his payments as he has done with his previous loans.

About 20 years ago she decided to get into business raising small livestock such as rabbits, hens, and turkeys.  She tells us that when she began she only had the equivalent of $3 USD to invest in her business but she been able to invest more money, little by little, up $1,280 USD today.  She takes her animals to market nearly every week and tells us that her sales are higher during holidays such as Mother\u2019s Day, Father\u2019s Day, national holidays and Christmas.  She checks prices on Huaylas street, so that she can sell her animals for the best price in the city of Huaraz.

This is 34 year old Happiness M. from Mwanza. She is married with two children, ages 10 and 13 years old.

She sells cooking oil, rice, soda and salt and works at her business for 12 hours a day, 6 days a week. Happiness currently earns about 250USD a month from her business. She is requesting a loan of 400USD in order to purchase wheat flour, rice, sugar and soaps. In the future, she plans to open a second business. Happiness thanks you for your support!\r\n\r\nABOUT SELFINA!\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling fish in the local community. Virgie has been engaged in her business for over two years and earns approximately 2000 PHP a month for these activities.<p>\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Virgie joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Virgie is requesting a new loan of 4000 PHP which will be used to repair her fishing boat. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Virgie from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement her family's income. <p>\r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:<p>\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.<p>\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

The distribution of farming inputs is part of One Acre Fund\u2019s integrated agriculture package, which includes training, reliable input supply (such as fertilizer and seeds), credit and insurance.\r\n\r\nWith income from maize sales, Consolata will educate her children and invest in business.\r\n\r\nIn 2012, the members of the Nyange Huruma group will each plant between \u00bd and 1 acre of maize.\r\n\r\nPicture\r\nConsolata is pictured with her group members in the photograph, with their Field Officer (Annah Malemo) on the left."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":925,"image":{"id":891954,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To source farming inputs such as seeds and fertilizer at low prices for the 2012 planting season.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Chwele","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2011-10-25T15:30:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":925,"lender_count":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Clarine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Risper","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Consolata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Joseph","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Richard","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Alice","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Janipher","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rose","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Janepher ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Joseph","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-10-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":90300,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90300}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":925}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":925,"local_amount":90300,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-27T10:15:12Z","rounded_local_amount":92359.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315680521}],"funded_date":"2011-10-26T20:28:55Z","paid_date":"2012-11-27T10:15:12Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":353023,"name":"Josephine","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Josephine is a 27-year-old married mother of two children, a five-year-old, who is currently enrolled in school, and a six-month-old.

They have eight children, but only live with four; the youngest is only three years old. They live in their own house in the native community of San Pablo de Shaoriato, in Pichanaki district, in Chanchamayo province.\r\n\r\nBenito is an exemplary husband and father. His family is what drives all his efforts. He learned to do farm work from the time he was small. So it is that he started his own plantings in parcels of land that his community and his parents granted him. Now he has three parcels. In that way he has been able to supply and balance his production.\r\n\r\nHe grows coffee and ki\u00f3n (ginger). \"Kion is profitable like coffee. I sell each kilo for 2 soles and 50 centimos. In December is will be worth three soles and 50 centimos, because it is scarce,\" he says. Planting ki\u00f3n is profitable for the villagers in the area, because of the soils and climatic conditions.\r\n\r\nBenito produces 1,500 kilos each year, and it sells quickly to the condiment companies, and to other buyers who take it as a coloring agent. Benito wants to expand his plantings and increase his output. With that, he wants to provide better living conditions for the rest of his children who are still minors. \r\n\r\nThis would be the first time that Benito has obtained a loan from MFP, so he gives his word that he will make his instalment payments on time. He is excited to be a part of the \"Los Norionkis de San Pablo\" communal bank.

But since family expenses have grown more and more onerous, Ms. D. just cannot go any further.  And so she is asking for help to improve her business.  Her skill and honesty has resulted in more business than she can handle.  She is therefore requesting a loan of $850 to enlarge her chicken coop and to serve as capital to do trade in chickens.

This experience proved very beneficial as, within a year, her working capital went from 50,000 CFA Francs ($125) to 85,000 CFA Francs ($210).  Other loans followed this first one. The only detriment to her career as a female entrepreneur has been her health, which was a little fragile in 2006, the year when she received a loan of 70,000 CFA Francs ($175). Her health has since improved and her business has returned to normal. She is therefore requesting her seventh loan to better position herself. \r\n Translated from French by Alison Dent, Kiva Volunteer.\r\nNative de LOKOSSA dans le d\u00e9partement du Mono au sud est du B\u00e9nin, dame G.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New Western culture and Central Asian traditions. But, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

L., Mar\u00eda Milagros A. M., and Mar\u00eda Dionisia Gal\u00e1n P\u00e9rez.\r\n\r\nThe Cereza solidarity group consists of Linda Urania F. L., Mar\u00eda Milagros A. M., and Mar\u00eda Dionisia Gal\u00e1n P\u00e9rez.\r\n\r\nLinda Urania is the group\u2019s coordinator.  She makes a living selling foods such as fried snacks, soft drinks, and cajetas (caramels).  She has a son who is in school.  Linda Urania has worked in this activity for three years.  She is going to invest her portion of the loan in the purchase of food ingredients such as vegetables, fruits, meat, corn, and sugar, which she will process into the prepared foods that she offers to her customers at the Masaya bus stop.  Linda Urania is married.  Her husband has worked as a carpenter for a very long time and helps her with the household expenses.  Linda Urania likes having her business because it provides her with her own income and thus allows her to purchase things she likes such as clothing, shoes, and household items.  She was selected as the group\u2019s coordinator because her business is close to the ADIM agency and she can therefore make the payments on time.\r\n\r\nAnother member of the group is Mar\u00eda Milagros, who makes a living selling pastries, coffee, sandwiches, and trout.  She has been involved in this activity for many years.  She sells her foods as a street vendor in the market.  Her business has grown, and she used a loan to purchase milk, sugar, breads, enchiladas, etc.  She offers these products to her customers in the mornings.  Her work schedule runs from the early hours of dawn until two in the afternoon.  She hopes she can offer her customers other kinds of food. \r\n\r\nMar\u00eda Dionisia Gal\u00e1n makes a living selling pastries and beverages from her home, and in the mornings sells her foods in the local market.

She is 37, married, and has four children.  One child is still dependent and goes to school.  Out of the need to contribute to the household income, and being self motivated, she started a small business selling bread with her first loan for 300 PEN.  She got good results because of the reasonable prices and good customer service.  Later, she added grocery sales to her business, which is located in her house.\r\n\r\nShe currently continues with the two businesses.  Her main customers are her neighbors.  \r\n\r\nWith this loan for 2,000 PEN she will buy more products to stock her business like kilos of rice and sugar, crates of eggs, personal hygiene items, household cleaners, packages of soft drinks, sweets, and other products to keep her customers happy.  She will use part of the money to buy supplies to prepare her breads.\r\n\r\nShe is very happy about the work and service offered.  She is grateful to the Manuela Ramos Movement for helping people like her who want to work and get ahead.  She hopes they continue this way for a long time and that they help many families and enterprising women.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":384163,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Buy groceries and supplies to make her breads","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"San Mart\u00edn","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":72,"posted_date":"2009-09-07T15:40:11Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":700,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-08-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2009-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2009-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2009-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2010-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2010-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":116.67},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":116.66},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":116.67},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":116.66},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":116.67},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":233.45,"local_amount":667,"processed_date":"2009-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T02:15:27Z","rounded_local_amount":688.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96990332},{"amount":116.55,"local_amount":332.99,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:43:11Z","rounded_local_amount":343.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103835300},{"amount":116.66,"local_amount":333.33,"processed_date":"2009-12-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T15:07:00Z","rounded_local_amount":344.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110727038},{"amount":116.67,"local_amount":333.33,"processed_date":"2010-01-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:05:48Z","rounded_local_amount":344.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118117532},{"amount":116.67,"local_amount":333.35,"processed_date":"2010-02-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:44:00Z","rounded_local_amount":344.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123953399}],"funded_date":"2009-10-03T01:40:11Z","paid_date":"2010-03-15T10:44:00Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ginny Kalish"}},{"id":139124,"name":"Galina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Galina is married and has two teenage children.

She lives with her husband and thier five children in the La Mercedes sector of Paredones, which is a rural area in Morrope, about an hour from Chiclayo. Ever since she got married, Maria has been breeding, raising and selling animals. She works from home farming poultry, cows and pigs, and sells them to dealers who travel through her area. She also offers animals for sale at wholesale markets in Chiclayo. \r\n\r\nMaria went into business out of necessity. Her husband, a farm worker, doesn't make enough money to cover their family's household expenses. Maria wants to expand her business by buying more animals to raise and sell. This is why she has applied for her first 1500-Soles loan from Edpyme Alternativa. Maria is a very responsible woman with a strong sense of responsibility.

This is located in Olmos district, 2 hours 15 minutes north of the city of Chiclayo. \r\n\r\nSince 3 years ago, she has been the proprietor of a small grocery store that functions in her house.  Here she sells products of primary necessity (rice, sugar, cooking oil).  The business is sufficiently important for her neighbors, since the zone where she lives is located outside the nearest town and often they don't have daily access to consumer products.  With the income she receives from this activity she is able to cover her family's expenses.\r\n\r\nSabina endeavors to offer her customers good service, always trying to provide quality products and attentive service to her clients.  Her business has been growing over time and now, she needs to acquire more products to satisfy customer demand.  For this reason, she has decided to request a loan from Edpyme Alternativa for 2,000 new sols.\r\n\r\nSabina has previously worked with our Institution and with the Kiva fund.

Having repaid her previous loan of 15,000 PHP from ASKI that was used to purchase materials needed to provide service, she is now requesting her ninth loan of 15000 PHP for the same purpose.  Evangeline plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay the tuition fees of her children. <p>\r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:<p>\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 38 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.<p>\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

He is 36 years old. \n\nGocha is leading the agricultural business in the family. They own two milk cows and one sheep and sell the dairy products on nearby town's open market. The family earns additional income through sales of grapes harvested from their family-owned 250 vine trees. Along with the family farm, Gocha also works as a loader in the village. \n\nGocha is married and lives with his family: his wife Olja and his 16-year-old daughter. Olja has health problems and gets a monthly pension from the state in the amount of 70 Laris. Gocha\u2019s daughter goes to school. The total average income of the family is 630 Laris, including Olja\u2019s pension. \n\nGocha requested credit for building a sheepcote (pen for sheep).

They have 2 precious children and are currently living in her mother\u2019s home. Ever since she was young, she has worked the land. She grows potatoes and, on a smaller scale, peas. During this whole time, she has been learning the responsibilities of a good farmer. Her specialty is growing potatoes, for which she gets up at 4:00 am to prepare meals. At around 8:00am, she takes the food and walks for an hour and a half to get to her farms. Meanwhile, her husband starts working the fields at 6:00am in order to get a head start. The problem, which is out of their control, that threatens them is when frost affects the potatoes, they lose their investment. Because of this aspect, they grow crops in irrigated lands, but they do not have their own land, which means they must rent land that is available. Hence, they do not lose much and at the same time, they do not invest much. They plant the other half on their seasonal farm, but the investment is more costly and they run the risk of frost. Elizabeth is a senior member of MFP. She has requested 7 consecutive loans, during which time her business has expanded and her crops have increased. For this reason, she is very grateful to this institute. She is still committed to making her payments punctually. The money being requested will be used to purchase a pesticide called Temex, which costs approximately 1,000.00 PEN, and fertilizer at 95.00 PEN a sack.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Elizabeth Casian, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":825,"image":{"id":261608,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Purchase pesticides and fertilizer","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-01-27T05:50:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":825,"lender_count":29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elizabeth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-13T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2600,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":825,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":2600}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":825}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":825,"local_amount":2600,"processed_date":"2009-09-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:34:31Z","rounded_local_amount":2627.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87080105}],"funded_date":"2009-01-27T09:42:29Z","paid_date":"2009-10-15T23:34:31Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Elizabeth Casian","image":845142}},{"id":89934,"name":"Socorro Guadalupe","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Socorro inici\u00f3 el negocio por la necesidad tener una entrada extra de dinero, ya que aunque es empleada de ventas en una empresa que se dedica a la fabricaci\u00f3n de tintas pl\u00e1sticas, el sueldo que percibo no  es suficiente por lo que decidi\u00f3 comenzar su negocio  en Julio de 1998 en un cumplea\u00f1os de una de sus hijas elaboro algunos arreglos infantiles y le gustaron mucho a sus amigas, fue entonces que decidi\u00f3 arriesgarse a elaborarlos para su venta y a la gente le ha gustado mucho su trabajo lo cual ha hecho que cada d\u00eda tenga mas clientes.\nGracias  a su esfuerzo su negocio ha ido progresando considerablemente ya que inicio  haciendo pocos arreglos pero en la actualidad la gente ya conoce su trabajo y adem\u00e1s de hacer sus arreglos, desde hace seis meses ya tambi\u00e9n se dedica a la impresi\u00f3n de invitaciones, vasos, servilletas, etc\n\nElla necesita un pr\u00e9stamo por MXN $4000 que pagara en 8 catorcenas lo que le permitir\u00e1 contar con suficiente materia prima para poder elaborar arreglos ahora que se acerca el 14 de febrero, d\u00eda de san Valent\u00edn en donde la gente organiza fiestas y hace regalos.\n","en":"\r\n\r\nSocorro started her business out of the necessity to have extra income, although she is employed in the sales of a company that makes dyed plastics, the income of which is not enough to be dedicated to starting a business.

Aside from business income, she receives also monthly remittance from her husband working abroad for not less than 10,000 PHP.\n\nIn 2006, Noribel joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities.

This previous loan was used to purchase additional inventory and used as working capital.\n\nNoribel is requesting a new loan of 50,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional construction materials and to pay the labor for house improvement. This loan will be her 6th from PMPC.

San Pedro, Puerto Princesa City, Palawan. She earns her living by operating two business ventures: hog fattening and a tricycle operator business. Her husband, Wilton E., who is 47 years old, works as a bank security guard to earn his living. They have four children who range from seven to 19 years old. \r\n\r\nLeny Lilibeth joined NWTF - Project Dungganon in 2004 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 12 loans from NWTF - Project Dungganon, Leny Lilibeth has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 16,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 21,500, thus uplifting the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 13th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 10,000 which she intends to use for the purchase of pig food so she can continue to save up for her family's future and her children's education. Leny Lilibeth is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed on a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work. \r\n\r\nHelp NWTF continue its mission to help the poorest in the Philippines by clicking the link to the NWTF Kiva lending team on Kiva.org to join our

She is married to Rony, a carpenter. She has one child. With her husband, she manages their household while operating a business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for her everyday expenses.  \r\n\r\nLejani owns a variety store. She buys groceries like canned goods, condiments, milk, and sugar: primary commodities that are needed in every household. She earns money by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors in the local community. She earns a minimum of 300 PHP in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operating her business, she is requesting a 10,000 PHP loan. She will utilize the loan to buy more grocery items, which will enable her to have more inventory on hand. The more items displayed at the store, the better. It helps to attract more customers to buy in her variety store. More sales will result in more profit. It will help her to save more money for the expenses of her child in school. \r\n\r\nLejani hopes that her business will continue to generate an income that is sufficient enough for the needs of her family. She is active in attending the weekly fellowship* as it helps to learn a lot from the Bible. It strengthens her spiritual life.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay micro-finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":916241,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To purchase grocery items for inventory","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Batasan, Quezon City","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2011-11-17T02:10:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":250,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lejani","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-10-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-10-27T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-12-29T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":666.62}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":100,"local_amount":4000.02,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:32:08Z","rounded_local_amount":4330.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244529512},{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":3332.98,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T09:39:06Z","rounded_local_amount":3607.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250738728},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":2667,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-16T09:02:12Z","rounded_local_amount":2887.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257145960}],"funded_date":"2011-11-17T04:45:05Z","paid_date":"2012-02-16T09:02:12Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"JoEllen Wilkins","image":null}},{"id":361251,"name":"Habsamet","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Habsamet is 51 years old and lives with his wife and three daughters in a ger (traditional Mongolian hut) in Bayan-Ulgii province, Mongolia.

The members of the Mi Banquito communal bank in that city meet every 15 days. \r\n\r\nHere we meet Mrs. Carmen, 46, who is married and has three children, one of whom is an adult and the other two, 16 and 5, are in school.  Her husband is a merchant.\r\n\r\nShe is a very good homemaker who wants to help her husband with the household expenses by taking out a loan to finance his business.  He sells grains such as beans, lentils, peanuts, etc., working four days a week at the market in Manta.  He has been in business for 15 years and thankfully it is going well and allowing them to get ahead.\r\n\r\nThis loan will be used to buy lentils, beans, peanuts, and corn, among other things.  She is a founding member of the communal bank which she enjoys because the institution's interest rate is lower than anywhere else.\r\n\r\nHer dream is to have good health and continue striving to get ahead.\r\n\r\nIn the photograph she appears with her son.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":900,"image":{"id":741128,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Market","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To buy lentils, beans, peanuts, corn, etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Montecristi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2011-12-22T09:40:14Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":900,"lender_count":33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Carmen Lucciola","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-12-14T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":880,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2012-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2012-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2012-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2012-02-27T08:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2012-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2012-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2012-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":110}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":337.5,"local_amount":330,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T10:17:15Z","rounded_local_amount":337.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257183260},{"amount":225,"local_amount":220,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:30:12Z","rounded_local_amount":225,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263318866},{"amount":225,"local_amount":220,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T09:26:27Z","rounded_local_amount":225,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270033755},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":110,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:37:42Z","rounded_local_amount":112.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276645834}],"funded_date":"2011-12-22T16:49:25Z","paid_date":"2012-05-15T09:37:42Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sherry Bess","image":833485}},{"id":377639,"name":"Rolando Elias","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Rolando, se ha decidido por un nuevo pr\u00e9stamo ya que quiere surtir el negocio comprando m\u00e1s mercader\u00eda, pues su idea es ofrecer a los clientes Cd y Dvd con un contenido navide\u00f1o, tambi\u00e9n comprar material (tela) para la elaboraci\u00f3n de trapeadores esto le ayudar\u00e1 para mejorar su capacidad frente a los clientes.\nEl considera que a trav\u00e9s de una buena administraci\u00f3n los negocios pueden mejorar y en su caso a trav\u00e9s de estos pr\u00e9stamos est\u00e1 obteniendo una mejor ganancia y crecimiento.\n","en":"Rolando would like a new loan, as he wants to stock up for his business and buy more merchandise.

They provide all types of photographic services and sell every imaginable camera accessory. Film is developed and cameras, batteries, and even movies are sold within their walls. Albertina and her husband have been the sole owners of their studio for almost one year and a half. Before, Albertina was working in various other photo studios in the area and her husband was an employee in the shop they currently own, under different management. When the owner of the studio Albertina\u2019s husband was working in retired, the couple jumped at the opportunity to buy the studio and apply the knowledge they had been gaining over the past several years. \r\n<p>\r\nToday, Albertina\u2019s photo studio is a rapidly growing business where she and her husband are busily attending to their many customers. When asked if she has any goals for maximizing the growth of her business, Albertina\u2019s eyes widen and she sighs with an exasperated expression she saying \u201cyes!\u201d The machine currently being used to develop customers\u2019 film is rented, and to own one themselves would be an incredible help, she explains. As well, they still lack the equipment to develop digital pictures. Acquiring such capabilities would allow Albertina and her husband to enter an entirely new market and bring their photo business to the next level. \r\n<p>\r\nEverything Abertina and her husband do is with the motivation of supporting their growing family of a seven year-old daughter and baby girl on the way. Being a part of her village bank has allowed them the opportunities needed to grow their business and this is why she says she is so pleased to be involved. She has also learned how to save her money in the bank, a skill that has helped immensely in provision for her family. Albertina is asking for a $400 loan. With this money, she will buy and sell larger quantities of products, the first step on her way to new equipment."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":84944,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Photography","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"To buy and sell larger quantities of products, the first step on her way to new equipment.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":70,"posted_date":"2007-11-18T23:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Albertina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-12-03T02:39:02Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1195,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":298.75},{"due_date":"2008-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":298.75},{"due_date":"2008-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":298.75},{"due_date":"2008-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":298.75}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":100}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":100,"local_amount":298.75,"processed_date":"2008-01-03T10:22:45Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-03T10:27:09Z","rounded_local_amount":299.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":107572},{"amount":100,"local_amount":298.75,"processed_date":"2008-02-03T10:15:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-03T10:27:09Z","rounded_local_amount":299.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":127461},{"amount":100,"local_amount":298.75,"processed_date":"2008-03-03T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-03T10:27:09Z","rounded_local_amount":299.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":148184},{"amount":100,"local_amount":298.75,"processed_date":"2008-04-03T10:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-03T10:27:09Z","rounded_local_amount":299.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172607}],"funded_date":"2007-11-19T02:39:02Z","paid_date":"2008-04-03T10:10:22Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":28487,"name":"Khup","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Khup C., 45, is a mother of five children and lives with her husband in Kampong Cham province, Cambodia.<p> She and her husband work producing mortars and pestles, earning collectively around $6 a day in revenue.

According to them, they feel like part of the Adim family. Sebastiana del Rosario V. Gaitan is the group coordinator. She has a small store in the area, which has grown with each new loan that she has received. She says that she has seen her business improve with each loan and with greater investment. She has a child in her care who has a disability. She cares for him and purchases his medicine. By having her business in her home she is able to be self employed and care for her child. Her husband helps her with the expenses, but she feels good being the owner of her own business. She is encouraged to keep working and to keep caring for Adim when she thinks of all that she has achieved. She shares this with her group and for this reason she is charged with delivering the payment to ensure that it is made on time. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by James Comstock, Kiva

She starts preparing everything she will need for her sales at three o\u2019clock in the afternoon and then sells from five until midnight.

He also earns income from his small-scale farming of tea which he sells to a local tea factory, and a garage which he operates in the same region. His biggest challenges in farming have been the poor road network and lack of enough funds to expand his farm.\r\n\r\nHe has requested this loan of 50,000 KES through Juhudi Kilimo to purchase a motorcycle for transporting milk to the cooling plant.

very well. She prefers to stay at home and take care of her family. She is a resident of Jaranwala, which is a small city located in the Punjab province of Pakistan and known for its agricultural industry. She has been living there with her family in a three-room brick house for the past 10 years. Her husband's name is M. S. and he is a scrap dealer. He supplies scrap to different factories and to other scrap dealers on demand and generates income for the family.  \r\n\r\nRazia has four sons and a daughter. Her eldest son left his education and started working. He is a bus conductor. The other two are enrolled in a local school getting their education. \r\n\r\nRazia has applied for a loan from Kiva's partner, Asasah, for her husband who wants to buy scrap to fulfill the demands of his clients. With the loan, he will buy scrap such as used paper, plastic bottles, etc. He has been operating this business for the past many years and is well known among his clients for his good work.

She and her three children live in their own home in the community of Gloria Amargura in the District of Llochegua.  Everything began for Ludgarda when she was a very young woman.  She decided to work as a farmer, cultivating and growing cacao.  Ludgarda felt she lacked growth opportunities, so using only the salary she had saved up, she was able to have her own business.  At the moment, she grows and sells fruit, especially pineapple.  She is grateful to her mentors for the great lessons in farming that they gave to her.  For this reason, she is able to grow high-quality products that will satisfy more potential buyers.  As a result, her business will generate good financial results.  Ludgarda usually works on her own, but occasionally she gets help from her children during the harvest season.  During this time, she hires workers to facilitate the transport of her product to the collection centers in her community so that she can sell it at a fair price.  \r\n<p>\r\nThis will be her first loan with MFP.  Ludgarda hopes that everyone will support her so that she can grow her business.  The loan of 2000 PEN that she is requesting will be used to expand her pineapple crop.

end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Having seen that the production and sale of palm oil is a very profitable activity in her town, she is seeking the means to develop her business. To do so, she is requesting a loan of $600, which will serve as the capital to buy palm nuts in large quantity and to prepare red palm oil.

He then shepherds the herd of llamas to a town two days away, where he sells them. This loan will be used to buy more llamas, since Jesus doesn't have enough investment money to earn enough to live on. <p> This is the third time Jesus has requested a loan from IMPRO.

She is married and has three children who are pursuing education in junior and senior high schools. Esi\u2019s husband is a welder by profession. He farms as well. Esi and the family live at a family house at Oda in the Eastern Region of Ghana. Most of the inhabitants of Oda are either farm or trade in farm products. Very few people in this area run different types of businesses. \r\n\r\nEsi trades in second-hand textiles. She buys textile fabrics and all kinds of second-hand clothes including bed spreads, ladies\u2019 wear and men\u2019s wear, etc from Accra, the capital city. She then sells these items in the market square in her community. She says she also treks to nearby markets to sell. Esi has been in this business for barely year now and wants a loan to increase her working capital so that she can buy textiles in bales. \r\n\r\nShe believes the loan assistance would enable her to purchase better quality stock to serve a larger market and eventually, help to improve her family finances.

She was able to purchase a small kiosk located in one of the local markets in busy downtown.  Her polite manner and rich experience have helped her operate her business successfully. Over time she has gotten to know the preferences and tastes of her customers making her kiosk a popular stop when they visit the market. Her daughter\u2019s active participation in the business has also added greatly to its success. \r\n\r\nTo meet growing demand from her customers, Ludmila is requesting a loan for $1000 which will allow her to purchase more underwear at wholesale prices. Increased selling capacity will not only meet the needs of her clients, but the additional profits generated will meet another of Ludmilla\u2019s goals \u2013 to help pay for her son\u2019s college tuition. This loan will allow her to increase her income and provide the necessary funds to pay for her son\u2019s education which she considers her most valuable investment.
