is a rice farmer from Santa Lucia in rural Ecuador. He has two children who are 5 and 7 years old. He has been working his lands for about 20 years.  Although he does not have much land, it is enough to make ends meet for his family. Segundo also brings in money by raising pigs. He travels to local markets to sell the livestock when ever he is in need of extra money.<\/p>\r\n<h4>The Santa Lucia Communal Bank<\/h4> \r\n<p> Segundo is part of the newest Communal Banks in the recently developed Mifex Rural Finance Program.  All of the members of the Centro Agricola de Santa Lucia Communal Bank are part of an Association of Rice Farmers in Santa Lucia. Their association works cooperatively to help in the commercialization of the product after it has grown. They will use the micro-loans to prepare their lands and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each others' guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the Primero de Agosto Association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many micro-finance programs, but Mifex believes that is imperative for the communities we works with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties.<\/p> \r\n<p><em>Below is more information about Santa Lucia compiled by Luis Crespo and Robert Edgar of the Mifex team when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. Special thanks to Mario Balazantegui who provided expert insight and contributed to the development of the alliances with the local organizations. <\/em><\/p> \r\n<h4>Economy of Santa Lucia<\/h4> \r\n<p>Santa Lucia County has a population of about 33,000 people. The sector is fit for rice cultivating because it is not in the lowlands and therefore it is not at risk of flooding. There is also great access to water because of the Daule River, which is accessible to many of the farmers in the area. About 70% of the farmers have basic infrastructure for watering their crops. <\/p> \r\n<p>Rice production is the main economic activity of the area as about 80% of the people are rice farmers. Almost everyone is either directly or indirectly involved with rice production, as they produce, commercialize or participate in activities that add value to the product. Within the county, there is a small town also named Santa Lucia. The town is filled with many small businesses and it serves as the social and commercial hub of the area.  <\/p> \r\n<h4>Rice Farming in Santa Lucia<\/h4> \r\n<p>Most of the people in the Santa Lucia area are small farmers. They produce about 100 sacks of rice per hectare of land. In order to farm they first must prepare the lands by removing weeds and plowing. The farmers then fill an area with water to form what is known as a paddy field, because rice is a very water intensive crop. The rice seeds are either dispersed freely (the process is known as <i>boleo<\/i> in Spanish) or hand sowed. Once the rice has grown, most farmers rent machinery that helps them gather their production. A risk factor does exist in rice farming because of drought, but in Santa Lucia this is somewhat mitigated by the access to water form the nearby river.  <\/p> \r\n<h4>Access to Credit<\/h4> \r\n<p>The biggest struggle in the area has been the lack of credit. Because people do not count on formal financial services, they have turned to loan sharks for financing. They have been affected by expensive lines of credit that exceed 100% interest a year and can be as expensive as 240%. Intermediaries also exploit the farmers because of their outstanding debt. Farmers also lack skills and knowledge to commercialize their products and pay fair prices for their crops.  <\/p> \r\n<h4>Loan Use<\/h4> \r\n<p>The loans in this sector will be used to to buy soil, seeds, fertilizer and insecticides. They will also be used to prepare the land prior to farming, to plant the seeds and purchase other materials. The loan repayment schedule is also different from the typical micro-entrepreneur. Because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures, Mifex asks them only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 6 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the seventh and final month. <\/p> \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":25063,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Rice farming","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Santa Lucia","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.183333 -80","type":"point"}},"partner_id":7,"posted_date":"2007-04-10T17:48:26Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":675,"lender_count":4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Segundo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-04-26T00:26:13Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":675,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":96.43},{"due_date":"2007-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":96.43},{"due_date":"2007-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":96.43},{"due_date":"2007-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":96.43},{"due_date":"2007-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":96.43},{"due_date":"2007-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":96.43},{"due_date":"2007-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":96.42}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":96.43},{"due_date":"2007-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":96.43},{"due_date":"2007-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":96.43},{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":96.43},{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":96.43},{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":96.43},{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":96.42}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":97,"local_amount":97,"processed_date":"2007-06-08T09:15:20Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T06:56:27Z","rounded_local_amount":97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":21390},{"amount":54,"local_amount":54,"processed_date":"2007-08-09T23:22:52Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T06:56:27Z","rounded_local_amount":54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":40788},{"amount":54,"local_amount":54,"processed_date":"2007-08-22T18:19:09Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T06:56:27Z","rounded_local_amount":54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":45307},{"amount":463,"local_amount":463,"processed_date":"2007-12-18T18:17:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T06:56:27Z","rounded_local_amount":463,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":99061},{"amount":50,"local_amount":50,"processed_date":"2008-01-02T22:02:11Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T06:56:27Z","rounded_local_amount":50,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":106821}],"funded_date":"2007-04-12T00:26:13Z","paid_date":"2008-01-02T22:02:11Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":11746,"name":"Carmen","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Carmen runs her own business selling basic household goods.

She has learned to make corn snacks, comfits, and other baked goods.\r\n\r\nShe says that credit is very useful for her because it allows her to gain access to the best markets, and that this loan would be invested in the purchase of soft drinks, ice creams, and also for the repair of the roof of her home, as the season of intense heat has arrived and she needs a little more fresh air in order to make her food.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jessica Kaminsky, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":222380,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To buy drinks, ice creams, and to repair the roof of Miryan's house","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PY","country":"Paraguay","town":"Villa Elisa","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-25.366667 -57.616667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":58,"posted_date":"2008-11-19T11:10:15Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":500,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Miryan","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-10-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PYG","disbursal_amount":2300000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":230000},{"due_date":"2008-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":230000},{"due_date":"2009-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":230000},{"due_date":"2009-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":230000},{"due_date":"2009-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":230000},{"due_date":"2009-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":230000},{"due_date":"2009-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":230000},{"due_date":"2009-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":230000},{"due_date":"2009-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":230000},{"due_date":"2009-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":230000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":50,"local_amount":230000,"processed_date":"2008-11-14T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-20T20:06:31Z","rounded_local_amount":230435,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5318703},{"amount":50,"local_amount":230000,"processed_date":"2008-12-14T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-15T22:44:00Z","rounded_local_amount":230435,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9937305},{"amount":50,"local_amount":230000,"processed_date":"2009-01-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-21T09:09:34Z","rounded_local_amount":230435,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14860871},{"amount":50,"local_amount":230000,"processed_date":"2009-02-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T08:49:26Z","rounded_local_amount":230435,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20402152},{"amount":50,"local_amount":230000,"processed_date":"2009-03-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T18:50:03Z","rounded_local_amount":230435,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27094219},{"amount":50,"local_amount":230000,"processed_date":"2009-04-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T16:56:15Z","rounded_local_amount":230435,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35987715},{"amount":50,"local_amount":230000,"processed_date":"2009-05-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T23:22:09Z","rounded_local_amount":230435,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44568929},{"amount":50,"local_amount":230000,"processed_date":"2009-06-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T20:54:35Z","rounded_local_amount":230435,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52959286},{"amount":50,"local_amount":230000,"processed_date":"2009-07-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T14:14:54Z","rounded_local_amount":230435,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63176535},{"amount":50,"local_amount":230000,"processed_date":"2009-08-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T15:46:31Z","rounded_local_amount":230435,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73602188}],"funded_date":"2008-11-26T01:07:48Z","paid_date":"2009-09-15T15:46:31Z","journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jessica Kaminsky","image":56671}},{"id":77306,"name":"Onyekachi","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Onyekachi O. owns a store where he sells rechargeable phones and phones accessories.

It has produced famous thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. A civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged an already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural productivity and the manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b><br>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent viable business prospects. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Ahmadjon is from the district of Kostakoz, Tajikistan. Currently, he dedicates himself to his livestock business, a popular enterprise that is characteristic of the region. He is the father of three children whom he cares for and has the responsibility of educating. His wife (pictured) actively helps him with operations. It\u2019s important to note that Ahmadjon is very conscious of his duty to support his family financially. It\u2019s for this reason that he turned to IMON International to obtain a loan to purchase some pregnant cows to help him increase his income. With your help, Ahmadjon will be able to make his business succeed and support his family. \n\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\n\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

He started working there when he was 19.  He married at an early age; he and his wife have two children.  He lives in the Camilo Ortega neighborhood.  \r\n\r\nWhen he started working he was a helper collecting fees.  He earned less doing this, but he was able to become a driver.  It is hectic work because he leaves his house very early and does about ten routes around the city to be able to earn well in a day.\r\n\r\nThis is his sixth cycle with Afodenic.  He will use the loan to buy construction materials to enlarge a room and be able to be more comfortable with his family.  Little by little he has made improvements on his house.\r\n\r\nHis goal is to one day be able to, through loans, have his own vehicle for transportation.

Abduhalim has been in this business for 3 years. His determination and strong will to succeed have helped him keep his business stable and sustainable and have promoted its expansion. Abduhalim would like to get a loan for $2600 USD in order to replace his car with the new one. With that way he will improve his business and earn more money by attracting more clients. We are confident that the modesty, diligence and responsibility that have helped Abduhalim develop his venture and gain a good reputation among other taxi drivers will help him promptly repay this loan and allow him to succeed in his business endeavors. \n\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\n\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Motorcycles are one of the most common means of transport in the middle and northern parts of Ghana, hence selling motorcycles is a lucrative job for traders. He also purchases cows from the northern part of the country and sells them to butchers and restaurant operators.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the country's already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Dice que inicio su negocio a sus 22 a\u00f1os teniendo su propia maquinaria pesada, que fue una herencia que le dejaron sus padres. Adem\u00e1s dice que el proyecto le es muy interesante ya que ha visto como poco a poco su negocio crece y la demanda cada vez es m\u00e1s fuerte.\n\nActualmente Don Luis est\u00e1 solicitando un micro cr\u00e9dito de \u00a2500.000 (quinientos mil colones) para la compra de repuestos para la maquinaria, para reparar sus maquinarias y asi seguir brindando su servicio a sus clientes, adem\u00e1s de ampliar y reforzar su local.

It is located on a plain with a very warm climate where activities such as cattle-raising, agriculture, and tourism, among others, occur.\r\n\r\nFor several years Luis has been working by renting Fernanda S.A. machinery.  His neighbors in the community are very satisfied.  He says that he started his business 22 years ago.  He had his own heavy machinery, which was an inheritance that his parents left him.  He also says that the project is very interesting to him because he has seen how, little by little, his business is growing and there is more demand.\r\n\r\nLuis is currently requesting a microloan for \u00a2500.000 (five hundred thousand colones) to buy replacement parts for the machinery.  He will repair his machinery, and that way he will continue to offer his customers good service.  This is in addition to expanding and strengthening his place.\r\n\r\nWith this he hopes to make his business grow more and to improve his quality of life.  His business is going well, but due to his lack of money he has not been able to make it grow more.\r\n\r\nLuis is a member of the Empresa de Cr\u00e9dito Comunal La Garita, one of the 110 member organizations with EDESA in Costa Rica.\r\n\r\nThis will be his first loan, and he plans to continue participating more actively in this type of organization.  \r\n\r\nHe assure us that ECC (Communal Credit Companies in English \u2013 are small credit organizations created and run by the very people who borrow from them) has had a great impact on the community because they previously did not have

She's 42 years old and lives with her partner and children. At the age of 6 she went to live with her grandparents, and was able to attend school until 4th grade. She has been with her partner, the father of her children, since she was 17. \r\n\r\nRight after starting a small business selling basic groceries, in 1992, Elisa got ill and was forced to stop working for a year. Once she got better she decided to dedicate herself to the business of selling clothes, which she has been doing for 4 years now. Elisa buys the clothes in downtown Maputo (the children's clothes are the most lucrative ones) and rents a car to have the pieces delivered to her neighborhood, where she sells them at a stand located near home. Elisa doesn't have a bookkeeping system to keep track of her transactions (she doesn't know how to do it and says she prefers to keep it all \"in her memory.\") Business is going very well for her, and she wants to use her loan to increase her inventory. Profits  from the sales are divided between helping with the household expenses, reinvesting in the business and saving. The Hluvuku loans have had a very positive impact on Elisa's life so far, and she hopes it will help her buy a piece of land in her home province, one day.\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Portuguese by Aline Pereira, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nLocaliza\u00e7\u00e3o: Bairro ferrovi\u00e1rio \u2013Maputo\r\nCliente:Elisa Armando C.\r\nActividade:Com\u00e9rcio\r\nValor de empr\u00e9stimo: 15,000.00mt ( 600usd)\r\nAplica\u00e7\u00e3o: venda de Roupas\r\nIn\u00edcio: 08\/10\/07\r\nFim: 30\/01\/2009\r\n\r\nElisa Armando C., nasceu aos 25 de fevereiro de 1965 em Namaacha prov\u00edncia de Maputo, tem 42 anos de idade, casada maritalmente tem    filhos estudou at\u00e9 4\u00aaclasse .\r\nViveu com os pais at\u00e9 aos 6 anos e com aus\u00eancia do pai teve que ir viver com os av\u00f4s at\u00e9 aos 16 anos , aos 17 anos junta-se com seu marido.\r\nEm 1992 iniciou o neg\u00f3cio de venda de produtos da 1\u00aa necessidade num dos mercados da cidade, algum tempo depois fica gravemente doente facto que lhe obrigou ater que parar durante um ano.depois de melhorar retoma o neg\u00f3cio tendo mudado o tipo de neg\u00f3cio passando a vender a roupa at\u00e9 ent\u00e3o e faz este neg\u00f3cio a 4 anos.\r\nN\u00e3o tem forma\u00e7\u00e3o neste neg\u00f3cio e n\u00e3o emprega ninguem por enquanto.Com o empr\u00e9stimo de 15,000.00mt comprou fardos de roupa para revenda.\r\nAbre o seu neg\u00f3cio as 8 horas e para chegar no seu posto de trabalho n\u00e3o usa nenhum meio de transporte por este  se localizar perto de casa.

When she began her partnership with her husband they worked from dawn to dusk on the farm; now her husband is more involved with the farm, and she helps him two to three times a week. The remaining days she buys fruit, transports them to her home, and then selects the fruit to make crates weighing 12 kilos. Her husband also loads his own fruit, so they rent one car to transport everything to the market. Florentina tries to carry a variety of products so she buys bananas, avocados and other fruit. When she invests 1,500 soles she earns 500 soles in profit, and if all fruit prices remain stable she earns more. This is her fourth loan with MFP, during her second loan she served as a vocal member where she called all partners to meetings. The money she has requested is to purchase a truckload of fruit, and it will serve as capital for future sales.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jennie Campos, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":260470,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Purchase a truckload of fruit","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-01-26T02:10:11Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":475,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Florentina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":188},{"due_date":"2009-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":188},{"due_date":"2009-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":188},{"due_date":"2009-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":188},{"due_date":"2009-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":188},{"due_date":"2009-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":188},{"due_date":"2009-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":188},{"due_date":"2009-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":184}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":59.53},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":59.53},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.53},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.53},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.53},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.53},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.53},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.29}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":59.53,"local_amount":188,"processed_date":"2009-02-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T20:02:00Z","rounded_local_amount":189.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20423671},{"amount":59.53,"local_amount":188,"processed_date":"2009-03-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:33:02Z","rounded_local_amount":189.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27116940},{"amount":59.53,"local_amount":188,"processed_date":"2009-04-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:42:21Z","rounded_local_amount":189.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36011861},{"amount":119.07,"local_amount":376,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T01:01:43Z","rounded_local_amount":379.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44595459},{"amount":119.07,"local_amount":376,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:46:34Z","rounded_local_amount":379.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63210836},{"amount":58.27,"local_amount":184,"processed_date":"2009-09-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:28:46Z","rounded_local_amount":185.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87080104}],"funded_date":"2009-01-26T03:24:35Z","paid_date":"2009-10-15T23:28:46Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jennie Campos","image":395908}},{"id":89610,"name":"Visitacion","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Visitacion C. has been growing rice since 1985.

He is a man who is passionate about agricultural work since his parents planted many expanses of land and usually filled their farms with the company of all of their brothers and sisters during the harvest months.  This is how they made a living.  Constantly changing the fertilizers for each one of their crops.  He was the one in charge of the maturation of the coffee growths.  Once they turned a cherry color, they had to be harvested right away, then washed, and dried.  \r\n\r\nFor Gilber, cultivating coffee is very important to the development and growth of his family.

Afiavi Honorine is married and has three children aged 11, 6, and 4, who are in 6th grade, 2nd grade, and kindergarten, respectively. The family has lived in Kow\u00e9gbo, a district in the city of Cotonou, for thirteen years. Afiavi Honorine runs as her main business the sale of fabric and jewelry, which she delivers on order and on credit to her clientele. Afiavi Honorine has diversified her business through the sale of various items (sweets, biscuits, cans of milk, sardines, tomatoes, sugar, food pastes, soap for laundry, dishes, and bathing, batteries, candles, etc.) and food (beans, rice, maize, cassava flour, etc.). It is in front of her house that Afiavi Honorine sells her goods. Afiavi Honorine has faced difficulties in obtaining supplies due to her low working capital. This is why she has been working with ALIDE (one of Kiva's field partners) since 2006. Afiavi Honorine has already obtained four loans through ALIDE, all of which she repaid without problems, and with which she was able to raise the standard of her business. To continue developing her business, Afiavi Honorine is seeking a fifth loan to strengthen her working capital.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Vilas Menon, Kiva

Eleanora is 36 years old. She grew up in a low-income family, which is why she was unable to continue her studies after graduating from high school and began to help her parents with housework. When she was 27, Eleanora married and gave birth to a son one year later. Now her son is already 8 and studies in a rural school. Eleanora works as a freelance associate editor at the local rural newspaper \u201cNarodnaya Tribuna\u201d (The Peoples\u2019 Tribune). Eleanora\u2019s husband works as a security guard. Their income is hardly enough for their small family.\r\n\r\nLike many other people in the village, Eleanora and her husband decided to do animal husbandry. With initial capital of only 15,000 Kyrgyz Soms, the family bought a cow in 2001. With the first earnings from the sale of milk, the family finally reached a stable income. Now Eleanora wakes up without worrying where to get money to feed her family, provide her son with clothes and prepare him for school. \r\n\r\nEleanora's parents helped her buy a house in the same village. After getting her own home Eleanora pondered over the expansion of her business. Her son is getting older and to allow him to study at a good university, she needs to start saving money today. Eleanora wants to use her loan of 80,000 Kyrgyz Soms to buy another cow to increase milk production, as well as 4 bull-calves and 5 sheep for fattening and resale. \r\n\r\nThis hard-working and optimistic woman would like to have another child and sign up her son to a sports section and give him a good education. Because all of this is very costly, Eleanora plans to significantly expand her business in order to always wake up in the morning with confidence and \"a penny in her pocket\u201d.\r\n\r\nBai-Tushum and Partners uses Kiva funding to target the especially vulnerable population.

Su marido es Ing. El\u00e9ctrico.\n\nEs una ama de casa que para obtener sus propios recursos se dedica a la venta de ropa por catalogo. Tambi\u00e9n vende productos de Yanbal (productos de belleza, cosm\u00e9ticos, perfumer\u00eda y accesorios para damas). Trabaja tres d\u00edas a la semana, deja sus productos a cr\u00e9dito y cobra cada semana o cada quince de acuerdo a lo que quieran sus clientes. Sus productos los recibe en su casa y la ropa compra en una distribuidora.\n\nEste cr\u00e9dito es para invertir m\u00e1s en su negocio y adem\u00e1s para comprar sabanas que sus clientes le piden y quiere tambi\u00e9n vender estos productos.

From the relationship she has a 10 year old son who is studying in school.  Her husband is an electrial engineer.\r\n\r\nShe is a homemaker who sells clothing by catalog to have her own resources.  She also sells Yanbal products (beauty products, cosmetics, perfume, and accesories for women).  She works three days a week, leaving her products on credit and charging every week or every two depending on what her customers want.

With the help of her past 24 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Nelly has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 19,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 8,000, uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 25th loan, she is borrowing PHP 19,000, which she intends to use to buy more stocks of goods to sell so that she can continue to save up for the future needs of her family.  Nelly T. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

She used to work in a company but when she had her first child she decided to dedicate herself completely to taking care of him and that is how she started this business which regularly generates profit. She sells through catalogues to her friends and acquaintances and then brings them their orders for which they pay by credit. As well, she buys beauty products when they are on sale and keeps them in stock for a while to sell them at regular price. Since she is an enterprising woman, she has planned for the future to install a variety store where she can offer her products as well as school supplies, since there is no competition in the zone where she lives.

This will greatly help her grow her business. It will enable her to purchase quality ingredients and expand the meals she cooks for her customers.

With their studies and knowledge, they will be able to face life head on, since their knowledge can\u2019t be sold and will never end. <p>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Spanish by Scott Crandall, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nLa profesora Lucrecia de 42 a\u00f1os es viuda, tiene 3 hijos estudiando primaria, secundaria y universidad.

She is forty years old and married with four school-age children. To make a living, Joy owns and operates a \"sari-sari\", a retail shop that sells a variety of different products in the local community. She has been engaged in this business for over three years and earns approximately $160 a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Joy joined HSPFI, a Kiva field partner, to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation by engaging in business activities. Joy is requesting a new loan of 5000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This will be her first loan from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, we created this template for our field staff to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate

life was full of challenges. She and her family were very poor and she worked hard to help her fisherman husband earn money for the cash flow of her family and to be able to support the education of her children until they graduated from college.\r\n\r\nWhen she became a member of ASHI seven years ago, loans Margie requested and received were spent on a business. Several businesses her loans have been financing include her husband\u2019s fishing, and tricycle (motorcycle with sidecar) for hire businesses. She was able to purchase a fishing motorboat and also a tricycle which he operates once the fishing is off-season. He also sometimes uses the vehicle as a service for selling fish to the people in their village.\r\n\r\nMargie was able to have her own business to manage as well, as she was able to purchase piglets for fattening. All these businesses still exist. As a matter of fact, her hog-fattening business has already grown and she has been able to sell more pigs to a lot of meat vendors.\r\n\r\nDespite the time required to manage her businesses, since she is also helping her husband in selling the fish, she makes sure that she is also able to spend time with her children. She wants her productive and reproductive roles played fairly.\r\n\r\nMargie\u2019s children are inspired by the effort they see from their mother. They studied very hard to graduate from college to make their mother happy. Expenses for their education came from their mother\u2019s educational loan from ASHI.\r\n\r\nEven though Margie has been facing several failures and problems in life, she is still happy because she was able to achieve her dream of graduating her five children from college. Now, four of them have their own jobs and source of income.\r\n\r\nHowever, Margie still aims to grow her fishing business. Her son, who is unemployed, will be operating another fishing boat she plans to purchase using the loan she is requesting from Kiva this time.\r\n\r\nThe proceeds of her businesses will be used to improve their house as well as making their life different from the one they once had.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":506419,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fishing","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To

In the afternoons, Marina joins her husband to work their own plot of land. Marina\u00b4s goal is to increase the yield of her farm. She hopes to earn enough revenue from the production of chili peppers to keep her children in school. She hopes to improve her economic situation and offer a better standard of living to her family. A major difficulty and limitation for Marina has been her lack of working capital combined with previously unsuccessful harvesting seasons.

As she has achieved a stable market, she has also managed to start selling a variety of goods.  She is a widow who lives in the Santa Elena de Barranquilla neighborhood and has 3 children aged from 29 to 33 years old.  She began her business career with a dressmaking business after her husband died and she found herself alone and in charge of supporting her family, something which she didn't do before.  She arrived at the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo with this initial business as part of a communal bank made up of four members.  Gradually her growth became so great that she decided to go it alone, setting up a communications business which is the one she currently has since it is one of the talents for which she is well known.  She currently has 6 computer systems and printer. She has already had 20 loans from this organization which have enabled her to provide an education for her children and improve her family's quality of life.  The improvements to her home and Gladys' self-sufficiency are well known as is her good repayment history which makes her worthy of the trust of the many institutions which approach her.\r\n\r\nGladys is currently requesting a Kiva loan to update her equipment and get ready for the student holiday period which is fast approaching. Her equipment needs to be working at full speed. Her dream is to adapt her house by building a second level in order to completely separate her business; to own a general store where she can sell her merchandise and, further in the future, she hopes to buy her own car so that she can go out for a drive with her family which is what they deserve after many years of effort.

People are compelled to try in as many spheres as possible in order to make a living.  The rural areas are the most vulnerable to any changes in the nation. With no production and substantially low employment, rural areas are left without a labor force and became even more undeveloped, while the urban population grows.  \r\n\r\nNazira K., 35, is a treasurer of this group of borrowers. A resident of the small coal-mining town of Tashkomur in Southern Kyrgyzstan, she has been involved in livestock breeding for two years. She is a mother of four children and her husband is a coal miner. He sells coal to local consumers and to other regions of the city. \r\n\r\nNazira says the biggest challenge for her is to pay enough attention to livestock breeding while raising four kids. Livestock needs careful treatment the whole day, starting from early in the morning until late in the evening. When the livestock is grown, Nazira sells it and buys new younger ones to raise.  This business always has enjoyed high demand because the Kyrgyz people\u2019s main dish is meat. \r\n\r\nThe business was Nazira\u2019s husband\u2019s initiative, thanks to which the family\u2019s monthly revenue is 10000 soms. This loan is planned for the purchase of  9-10 livestock animals. \r\n\r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance (MBF), a young, ambitious and socially-focused Microfinance Institution in Kyrgyzstan. \r\nMBF is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development and upholds the triple bottom line \u2013 People (building human capital and taking care of its customers as well as society), Planet (keeping environmentally friendly) and Profit (earning revenue to expand autonomously).

With a lot of hard work he was able to provide his family with their own home. From a young age he was an expert in feeding cattle, sheep and pigs, an ability he that was passed down from his father. But when he formed his own family he had to move to his wife's place, and since then he has learned the art of cultivating and working on the land he inherited from his in-laws. At first, he planted coffee along with the in-laws' citrus trees. Now he has gone off on his own, but he has not stopped supporting all the work of his wife's parents. <p>\r\nHildo is very happy at home and at work. Every time he harvests coffee he sells it to a coffee house that pays him 4.80 soles for every kilo. His earnings are safe and dependable, and don't fluctuate like the prices he could offer at the market. For the citrus products, he has buyers who go to the same sales point as the coffee, and although they pay him a lower price, it is convenient and saves time.

Her husband is living abroad. He went abroad in order to provide their children a better future, but the world economic crisis has prevented him from sending back much money. The home in which they live is the fruit of the couple's hard work and sacrifices, and Digna says that loans from the foundation have enabled her to repay some of her husband's debts.\r\n<p>\r\nDigna has a business selling fruit and vegetables. She also has a grocery store in her home which her sons help her run when she is not there. She is grateful to God for every day, be it good or bad.\r\n<p>\r\nShe has worked with her Community Bank for seven years and attends meetings every two weeks for training and to enjoy some leisure time with her friends in the group. \r\n<p>\r\nWith this loan from Fundaci\u00f3n ESPOIR, Digna will invest in her business by purchasing fruit and vegetables to sell.

Blender","image":123338}},{"id":155368,"name":"Juana","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":" Juana is 42 years old. She lives with her husband and 2 daughters in Corredores, a rural region of Southern Costa Rica. Juana has a business selling hand-made clothing, necklaces and bracelets from her home. She demonstrates a strong work ethic; assembling jewellery, making and selling clothes by day, while working evenings and nights in a local restaurant as a waitress.\n\nSimilar to the story of many low income individuals in Costa Rica, and across the world, Juana has found it impossible to obtain approval for a business loan from the local bank in Corredores. The bank requires a guarantor of a loan to be someone who is not part of her immediate family. Juana does not know any suitable guarantors, with a steady income and a secure job, other than her husband. From Juana\u00b4s perspective, the rules of the formal banking system have had the effect of excluding her from the financial services she seeks.\n\n In an effort to extend the reach of financial services to deserving entrepreneurs, Fundacion Mujer proposes to lend Juana 500,000 colons (around $862 US), with her husband as the loan guarantor. This will be her second loan with Fundacion Mujer. Juana received her first loan in 2008 for 100,000 colons ($173 US) which was repaid from her business earnings, on time and in full, within 6 months.\n\nWith this loan, Juana plans to purchase raw materials such as cloth and necklace parts in an effort to expand her jewellery and clothes-selling business. Recently, many of Juana\u2019s regular clients have inquired about the possibility of purchasing shoes. She would like to satisfy this demand and expand her business by providing quality footwear to her clients. She will use this loan to buy shoes from a contact in Panama to sell from her home in Costa Rica. Juana dreams of expanding her business and earning more money so she can provide a better standard of living for her family. She says that since starting her business 2 years ago, her self-confidence has increased. Juana is now a strong believer in her ability to improve living conditions for her family through her determination and hard work. \n\nYour contribution is a direct investment in the betterment of the lives of families living in a poor community of southern Costa Rica. By lending to Juana, a hard-working entrepreneur, you are enabling her to build towards a higher standard of living. On behalf of Juana and her family, we thank you for your

She makes her home here in a simple structure made of wood, concrete and a tin roof as a single mother with her one adult child.<P>\r\n\r\nIsabel is excited to be taking her fourth loan with Esperanza after having successfully repaid her previous loans, and she looks forward to continuing to grow with Esperanza. She plans to use this loan to invest in her business taking orders from her clients to purchase bed sheets, bedspreads, women's blouses and women's underwear in Santiago (the closest large city) and selling them at a profit. She will use the profits to continue improving her house to the point where there are no more wooden walls (which are susceptible to termites) with the long term goal of adding a small corner store to her home so that she can work from home. <P>\r\n\r\nAdditionally, she would like to see her son become a professional and she is using part of the profits from her loan to fund his university education, studying accounting. He is the first person in her family to attend university. She thanks you all for your support and would like to urge more people to join Esperanza so that they can improve their lives like she has.

However, not one book, no matter how big it could be and not a movie, no matter how many episodes it could contain, can show all of the nuances of people\u2019s daily lives.  These creations can only show single moments and offer an overall understanding about the lives of our heroes.  The heroes of our story deserve to be heroes of these books or movies because they labor every day for their families and try to provide them with good lives.\r\n\r\nKerimbubu I. is the leader of this group.  Some time ago, she lost her husband.  However, this did not break her and, on the contrary, gave her additional strength because she is a mother of four children.  Now, all of the four children are married and live separately.  Kerimbubu preferred not to be dependent on her children and is currently involved in growing agricultural crops.  She grows wheat and potatoes on her land plot.  In the autumn, she sells the harvest and receives her yearly income.  Kerimbubu has been involved in farming for four years and gained quite a bit of experience.  Originally, she started with five thousand som and now earns up to thirty thousand som per year.  Currently, Kerimbubu needs a loan in order to buy diesel fuel for field work.\r\n\r\nKerimbubu\u2019s group partners are:\r\n\r\nAnarkan Ibaeva is fifty-seven years old.  She and her husband raised seven children.  Her husband is currently retired, but he, Anarkan and their children are involved in growing agricultural products.  Their yearly income is about fifty thousand som.  Anarkan requested this loan in order to buy fuel and wheat seeds.\r\n\r\nGulnara C. is forty-five years old.  Her husband is a tractor driver.  Gulnara is a mother of five daughters.  Currently, Gulnara and her husband are preparing the field for sowing.  They will be planting wheat.  Their last autumn harvest was six thousand ton of wheat.

The credit consists of the necessary materials to plant \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of millet or sorghum.  The individual farmers are not pictured here but will be receiving an average loan of 5,349 shillings.\r\n\r\nJudith is married and has five children. She is 37 years old and is known as friendly, hardworking, and an experienced farmer.  She is active in her community in groups such as the prayer group and the burial committee.  Judith has been a farmer for 16 years.  She described her harvest as excellent last year, but believes she can have an even better one this year by continuing to work with One Acre Fund.  \t\t\r\n\r\nJudith joined One Acre Fund in 2013, and is now enrolling in the Long Rains 2014 season as a group leader.  Judith joined One Acre Fund so that she could get new farming methods, fertilizer and hybrid seeds.  Because she wants to help more farmers, Judith has gotten more involved with One Acre Fund as a group leader and Kiva representative.  Working with One Acre Fund has improved Judith's life because she has more farm training and was able to save money.  In the future, Judith hopes that her profits from 2014 can be used to send children to school and save for the future.  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nOne Acre Fund focuses on working with smallholder farmers across Kenya.  The organization pre-purchases seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings onto the farmers.  Judith and her group will use the Kiva loan to cover this initial cost of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer package from One Acre Fund.  One Acre Fund continues providing training and support throughout the planting and harvesting season to ensure a good harvest and repayment.  With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits and improved lives.\t\t\t\r\n\r\nThe field officer is also included in the photo and is standing on the left in the photo.\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1547704,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To gain access to hybrid seed and fertilizer for harvesting maize, millet, and sorghum.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Lugari","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":4400,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Judith","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jessicca","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jane","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Albert","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Patrick","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Zachariah","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rasoa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-28T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":379779,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":4400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":379779}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":4400}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":992795,"name":"Anita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Anita is 50 years old, married with five children.

village in Kampong Chhnang province. She sells firewood. Her husband, Mr. Lum Thol, is a farmer who owns a plot of land where he cultivates rice. Even though they work hard, they still earn less income than they need to provide a better life for their family. In order to improve their living conditions, Mrs. Tren C. decided to ask for a loan to add to her savings to build a new house. She is 35 years old and the mother of three children, two of whom attend the local school and the third is still too young to go school. One member of the group, Vy S., was not available for the photo, so her husband is in the photo.\r\n\r\nOne member of this group has an end-of-term loan and the rest have monthly payment loans. The end-of-term loan client is not required to pay any principal on the loan until the very end of the loan term. End-of-term (EoT) loans are AMK\u2019s main product because they are the most beneficial to Cambodia\u2019s poor.

M. is 38 years old and lives with his wife Virginia and his two sons, Kevin and Kener. They live in a small, rural community in Costa Rica called Las Delicias de Upala, in the Alajuela province. People in his community own shops, plant basic grains (including rice, beans, and corn), and raise cattle (for both meat and milk).\r\n\r\nBecause of the limited sources of employment in the community, Salvador decided to become a small businessman. He raises cattle and sells its meat, milk, and milk products in his community as well as in the surrounding area. In his estimation, this is an excellent area of opportunity, as he can sell to intermediaries or directly to the public.\r\n\r\nSalvador's father has been in this field for a long time, and this has helped Salvador experience all the different aspects of the job. Over the years, his father has taught him a lot about this business.\r\n\r\nSalvador is requesting a microloan for 570,000 Costa Rican colones, to be repaid in 24 months. With the loan, he will purchase three more cows in order to increase production. He knows that having more cows will require more care and attention. However, his desire to be a successful small businessman, to get ahead and to improve his family's living conditions, motivates him to work hard and with great care.\r\n\r\nSalvador is a member of the \u201cEmpresa de Cr\u00e9dito Comunal Datraban\u201d (Datraban Community Credit Company), one of the 100 member organizations of EDESA in Costa Rica. This will be his second loan, and he hopes to continue growing both personally and economically.

The group uses only locally available materials  such as sheep and camel wool to make their products. Tserendugjir started her business in 2006 and has since found much success. She has taught all of her children how to make slippers and they help her during their school vacations. Tserendugjir is a very open-minded and responsible businesswoman and her dream is to one day have her own souvenir shop where she and other local handicraft makers can sell their products. She is requesting a 2 million tugrug (approx. $1,380 USD) loan to purchase wool processing equipment that will enable her to increase the productivity of her business and the quality of her products."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1400,"image":{"id":373361,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"to

She lives in the locality of Santa Rosa (on the edge of the jungle), where she has her own home.  She recalls that a few years back, her spouse didn't have a job and they only had a small crop of cacao plants that in certain occasions could barely provide for her family.  Thanks to the unconditional support of her parents, they were able to overcome that difficult time.  Nowadays they cultivate and sell in large quantities to their buyers, who feel satisfied with the product that they are purchasing.  As a result, the sales produce good earnings.  In general, she receives constant help from her spouse and together they make a good team.  Sometimes she receives help from laborers to help facilitate the final production.  Normally she sells her product to the distribution centers in her area at a competitive price.  Her future plans are to acquire new land with the proposal of improving her quality of life and that of her family's.  This is her fourteenth credit with MFP.  As such, she promises to continue fulfilling her payment plan.  In addition, she is happy with her communal bank for providing good economic results.  With the credit that she is seeking, she plans to invest in the purchase of supplies and fertilizers in order to properly maintain her cacao plantations.     <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Tracy Quan, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":581934,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Purchase fertilizer to be used on her cacao plantations.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-08-11T13:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nilda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-07-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":1500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":550}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":550,"local_amount":1500,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T04:39:32Z","rounded_local_amount":1540.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191463082}],"funded_date":"2010-08-12T19:01:14Z","paid_date":"2011-02-16T04:39:32Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tracy Quan","image":null}},{"id":225707,"name":"Flora","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Flora S. is currently in the business of selling sugar, charcoal, cooking oil, fish and rice at the market and is requesting a loan to stock more bags of rice and jerrycans of cooking oil to sell.

Starting at 6 am she is ready to receive her early morning shoppers who appreciate the variety of merchandise that she offers in her store.  They don't have any doubts about shopping at her store since they are sure that they are going to find what they need.  What she likes most about her job is talking with her customers and finding out what is going on in the village.  She has been running her store for 23 years, however, the most difficult part of her job is having to stay in the store all day without being able to leave.   She knows, however,  that sacrifice has its rewards.  In time, she would like to see her business grow and to offer her customers better service.  \r\n\r\nThis is her fourth loan with MFP.  She expects to make her payments on time since she doesn't want to cause problems for the other members in her communal bank where she is very respected because of the discipline she brings to the group.  With the five hundred nuevos soles (Peruvian currency) that she is requesting, she will buy more products to better manage her store.  \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ann Achilli, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":597275,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To buy more merchandise for her store","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-09-08T16:00:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":200,"lender_count":6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-08-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-09T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":200}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":200,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:33:29Z","rounded_local_amount":559.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216549393}],"funded_date":"2010-09-08T18:17:40Z","paid_date":"2011-07-15T11:33:29Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":233902,"name":"Lutfiya","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"A married mother of two, Lutfiya has worked tirelessly for the past seven years to develop her lump sugar production business in Kurgantyube central market.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

They are going to use their loan to buy flour, sugar, food coloring, bags, oil, ribbons, tape and cinnamon to make wafers.  Virgilio is going to buy flour, sugar, shortening and firewood to bake bread.  Carina and Ofelia are going to buy wafers by the package to repackage in smaller amounts and sell.  \r\n\r\nMar\u00eda Guadalupe is 38 years old, married and has four children: three girls and one boy.  All her children are in school.  Her oldest daughter is in high school, the next two are in middle school and her youngest daughter is in elementary school.\r\n\r\nShe makes \u2018obleas\u2019 (sweet made from two thin wafers stuffed with caramel) and requested the loan to buy flour, food coloring, oil, sugar and bags to have everything necessary for her business.  She started the business six years ago.  Her children were small and she had economic needs so her cousin taught her how to prepare the dough for the wafers.  Her husband bought her the machines to make them and she used savings she had to buy the raw materials.  This is how the obleas business started.  \r\n\r\nShe likes to work to help her husband and to have money to live better.

She used the profit from her past loans to feed, clothe, provide medication for, and educate her children. Given a loan, she intends to invest it in poultry farming. She believes that this business will be a success because she has many years of experience farming poultry and also because there is high demand for poultry products.

Her husband is Armando, a contractor and father to her children. Delia, together with her husband, manages their household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nDelia operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which sells groceries, toiletries, and beverages to residents of the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy a packet of shampoo, a few pesos' worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns a profit by getting her inventory at wholesale prices and then retailing them by the piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and members of the local community. She earns a minimum of 350 Philippine pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue her business operations, she is requesting a PHP 10,000 loan. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, beverages, and other products she sells in her business. She expects a boost in her income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nDelia hopes her business will grow into a mini-grocery.
