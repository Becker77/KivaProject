C. is from the village of Holy Friday. She is 55 years old. Cristeta is the group leader of an 11-member group loan offered by ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is Cristeta D. C.'s Group.\r\n<p>\r\nCristeta is married and has 6 adult children. To make a living, Cristeta owns & operates an agricultural business raising crops. The main source of income for the business comes from planting & harvesting a variety of vegetables for sale. Cristeta has been engaged in her business for over 8 years and earns approximately 3,500 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2008, Cristeta joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Cristeta has successfully repaid a previous loan of 6,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional seeds, seedlings, and young crops to raise. Cristeta is requesting a new loan of 7,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase fertilizers such as manure. This loan will be the fourth loan taken out by Cristeta from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand it. \r\n<p>\r\n<b>About ASKI:<\/b><br>\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolk, and small entrepreneurs.\r\n<p>\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1700,"image":{"id":507119,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To

With the previous loan, Consolacion noticed that her monthly income almost doubled because she attracted more customers with her additional stock.\r\n<br>Prior to working with ASHI, Consolacion had no access to capital to support her business dreams. Positive growth from her business has helped Consolacion finance her children's education. Since joining ASHI, Consolacion has experienced positive changes in her life and used the additional income to support her family's daily expenditure. She hopes her business will continue to flourish so she can provide long-term financial stability for her family. \r\n<br>Consolacion is now requesting a Kiva loan for 20,000 PHP to purchase more foodstuffs for her store. This will allow her to grow her business further so that her family experiences a life that is full of fulfillment. With the support of ASHI and Kiva lenders, Consolacion is hopeful that her business endeavor will provide a steady income and improve her family\u2019s quality of life, which is currently underneath an umbrella of poverty.

It has produced famous thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. A civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged an already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural productivity and the manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent viable business prospects. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She owns a business venture, planting & harvesting  a variety of vegetables for sale.  Masele has many years of experience in this business.  Masele needs a loan of WST $1000 to purchase harvesting equipment such as wheelbarrows, shovels, rakes, baskets, and knives.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 150 tala or US $63 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Masele joined SPBD.    This is her 2nd loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Masele's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Masele T. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.9 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.9 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.55 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              1.89 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated. For more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/www.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

She is a farmer who owns a piece of land to cultivate rice. Her husband, Mr. Bros Loem, is a construction worker.

She stays at home and fulfills her household responsibilities efficiently. She has very good administrative abilities and handles the expenses of her home with great responsibility.  She also does embroidery part time for her neighborhood clients to help her husband financially.  She lives with her family in a three room brick house in Lahore, Pakistan. Lahore is the 2nd largest city of Pakistan and known for its history and culture. She has been living there in the area of Daata town for past 18 years. She is the mother of 2 sons and 4 daughters. Her sons work in a factory for a meager income and her daughters stay at home and help their mother in her household work. \r\n\r\nHer husband\u2019s name is M. S., and he manufactures furniture to order. His furniture showroom is located in the market, and he has a good number of clients who give him good orders of furniture.  Zahida has applied for a loan from Kiva partner, Asasah, to further expand her husband\u2019s business.

She lives in her own home with her partner Filomeno, 36, and their two beloved children: Nancy, 11, and Maykol, 8.  They want to provide the children with a better quality of life.  \r\n\r\nWith much effort, Leonora bought land to cultivate coffee, cacao and make toothpicks.  She works her land with her partner\u2019s help, and with the field workers who provide support.  They also help weed the land and gather harvests to the roads, so that they can then take them to market.  \r\n\r\nLeonora has done this for fifteen years.  What she likes most about her work is the liberty that she has over the use of her labor, since she decides what is best for her crops.  What she considers most difficult is fighting the plague of insects that take over crop shoots.  But today, Leonora\u2019s main priority is to buy new land so that she can expand.\r\n\r\nThis is her ninth loan with MFP.  She knows that she needs to be punctual in her payments and wants to access a subsequent loan.  She is very happy to be a part of her communal bank and contributes to the development of the group.  With the loan, she will purchase cacao and coffee seeds.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":763535,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"buy cacao and coffee seeds.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-05-04T16:00:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":725,"lender_count":27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Leonora ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-04-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":725}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":725,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:18:04Z","rounded_local_amount":2056.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257245169}],"funded_date":"2011-05-08T17:56:22Z","paid_date":"2012-02-15T11:18:04Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Flavia Garcia (vol)","image":1574380}},{"id":299895,"name":"Gerry","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Gerry is 41 years of age with five children.

rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Because she has a very large family, she needs additional income.  This is why, she started to buy and sell fabrics and food products.  She tries hard to improve her family life and ensure that her children attend prestigious schools and universities.  She is requesting a loan in the sum of $2000 for the purchase of school uniforms and supplies because school year is about to start, and everyone is getting ready for school."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2000,"image":{"id":852226,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to purchase school uniforms and supplies","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":100,"posted_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:27Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2000,"lender_count":72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kumri","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-08-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":2000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":143.79},{"due_date":"2011-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":151.7},{"due_date":"2011-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":152.47},{"due_date":"2011-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":156.15},{"due_date":"2012-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":161},{"due_date":"2012-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":161.87},{"due_date":"2012-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":170.2},{"due_date":"2012-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":172.5},{"due_date":"2012-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":176.53},{"due_date":"2012-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":180.22},{"due_date":"2012-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":184.85},{"due_date":"2012-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":188.72}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":143.79},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":151.7},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":152.47},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":156.15},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":161},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":161.87},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":170.2},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":172.5},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":176.53},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":180.22},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":184.85},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":188.72}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":143.79,"local_amount":143.79,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-19T08:13:44Z","rounded_local_amount":143.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":233368478},{"amount":153.37,"local_amount":153.37,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:40:00Z","rounded_local_amount":153.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238643611},{"amount":151.3,"local_amount":151.3,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:17:01Z","rounded_local_amount":151.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244598050},{"amount":156.34,"local_amount":156.34,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:28:30Z","rounded_local_amount":156.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250812045},{"amount":161.02,"local_amount":161.02,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-16T09:25:56Z","rounded_local_amount":161.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257220734},{"amount":161.99,"local_amount":161.99,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-16T08:16:59Z","rounded_local_amount":161.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263580681},{"amount":1072.19,"local_amount":1072.19,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-17T08:09:49Z","rounded_local_amount":1072.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270458069}],"funded_date":"2011-09-26T22:53:33Z","paid_date":"2012-04-17T08:09:49Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Anna Sorokina","image":null}},{"id":332683,"name":"Rogen","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rogen is 37 years old and married.

She would like to help more people make their homes comfortable and cozy , so she is requesting a loan for $500 to hire two more work crews who would help install vinyl windows and blinds.

Thi Bich is 33 years old. She lives with her husband and 2 children in the town of Ninh Giang, province of Hai Duong. Presently their main source of income is from raising pigs and selling their meat. Every day her husband, Mr. Lan, would go purchase the pigs, and she would sell the meat at the local market. The work is hard but it brings them a stable income. With their income of 183 USD per month, it helps her family in repaying the loans. For this loan, she wishes to borrow 550 USD to buy additional 7 pigs to raise, and subsequently to sell their meat for the upcoming Tet Holiday.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated

With God's help he has become an excellent supplier of vegetables for his community.  He is responsible for four people (a wife and three children) and earns his family's living with his farming.  He knows all the ins and outs of this business, in which he has 5 years of experience.  His great trump is his production of vegetables in the off-season; however, in order to accomplish this, he needs investment for purchasing seeds and mineral fertilizer.  For this reason, he is requesting a loan of 1500 Somoni ($450 USD) so as to supply enough to meet the demand.  This will allow him to better provide for his family.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>But Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>IMON's History<\/p>\r\n<p>Since December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is 41 years old. Rachel is married and has 5 school-aged children. To make a living, Rachel owns & operates a business venture in the retail sector operating a sari-sari or general store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling daily use products such as shampoo, soap, toothpaste, etc., in the local community. Rachel has been engaged in her business for over 3 years and earns approximately 3500 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Rachel joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Rachel has successfully repaid a previous loan of 15000 PHP from GDMPC. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Rachel is requesting a new loan of 20000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the twelfth loan taken out by Rachel from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of the borrower's family. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.

Jes\u00fas says that he decided to go into this line of work because there was no competition in the area and it is a very profitable business; a fact that was confirmed when he made his first profits.  That's how he started and today he continues to prepare his delicious dishes and pleasantly taking care of his customers, who seek out Jes\u00fas's fried chicken because of the quality and quantity he offers.

She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement the family's income. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three unit offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":576529,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase baby livestock to raise & sell in future","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Sapang Dalaga Misamis Occidental","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":136,"posted_date":"2010-08-13T19:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":225,"lender_count":4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Teresita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-07-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2010-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2010-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2010-11-29T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2010-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2011-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":1666.67,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:22:22Z","rounded_local_amount":1687.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166855190},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":1666.67,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:11:58Z","rounded_local_amount":1687.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172121906},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":1666.67,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T14:28:46Z","rounded_local_amount":1687.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177416004},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":1666.67,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T14:16:47Z","rounded_local_amount":1687.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182555544},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":1666.67,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T13:17:58Z","rounded_local_amount":1687.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188692257},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":1666.65,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T03:46:10Z","rounded_local_amount":1687.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191431551}],"funded_date":"2010-08-13T22:55:51Z","paid_date":"2011-02-16T03:46:10Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":226143,"name":"Jeanette","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jeanette G., 46, wants to achieve more in life not just for herself but for her family as well.

She lives in a batey (which is a very poor community) of Haitian families in El Seibo, Dominican Republic. Families that live in bateys have small houses generally made of scrap tin and wood; the best possible accommodation is a cement-block house.  These \u00a8houses\u00a8 consist of only one room where the whole family lives together. To provide for her family, Lislena buys clothes in the city and then re-sells them for a profit in her batey and another neighboring batey.  \r\nBy receiving loans, she and other members of the Bank of Hope are better able to survive the economic fluctuations and frequent sicknesses that make work hard and volatile.

Jarkin is 46 years old and married with two children. She started her own business seven years ago because her husband at that time was unemployed. Jarkin sells confectionery like candies, cookies and pastries in the local market. The generated income allows Jarkin to support her family. Jarkin dreams of educating all of her children with higher education.\n\nToday, Jarkin requests 4,000 Somoni for purchasing confectionery to enlarge her range of goods. The income she is planning to spend on the well being of her family as well as for educating her children.  \n\n\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is much appreciated and sought after by her clientele, especially because of the quality of her products. <P>\r\n\r\nWishing to better satisfy this ever growing clientele, she decided to join the micro-finance institution Soro Yiriwaso with whom she is on her first loan, which will be used to buy 8 lengths of \u201cpagne\u201d of the UNIWAX brand, 4 outfits of embroidered cloth, 5 lengths of \u201cpagne\u201d of the REAL brand, and 5 outfits of \u201cbazin moins riche\u201d (locally dyed damask) in Bamako and Bobo Dioulasso (Burkina Faso).     <P>\r\n\r\nShe has a place in the neighborhood market where she sells her merchandise, for cash or credit, to a clientele composed essentially of women. <P>\r\n\r\nWith this loan, she expects to make a monthly profit of  100,000 F CFA which will be used essentially to grow her working capital, contribute to covering family expenses, and pay the interest on the loan, investing any remainder back into her business.

Shokir, a 46-year-old married father of two, breeds calves and sells dairy products to the local people and dairy factories. The difficult circumstances and hardships in his life made him recognize the value of work from a very young age. For about six years he has been purchasing young cattle in the local market, fattening and then selling them. Raising livestock is the main income source in his family. Thus Shokir wakes up early every morning to feed his calves and cows with the goal of selling them at the best price in the local market when they have grown enough. Shokir`s main goal is to provide education for his children, and with this purpose in mind, he has applied for a loan in the amount of 5000 Somoni to buy calves in order to expand his business. Let's support this hard-working man and hold our hands out to help him. <p>\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes:  its role as a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and its famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets including Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <p>\r\n\t\r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous, and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment, forcing hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <p>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<p>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He lives with his mother, Ana, who is 41, and his father, Elmer, who is 43, and with his three siblings in their home.  On their farmland, you can see their extensive plantings of coffee and plantains. He has been doing this for 3 years, when he started to work with his father, hiring workers to facilitate the farmwork. One of the activities he most enjoys is harvesting the plantains, because he collects them bunch by bunch. On the other hand, he dislikes transporting his products for long hours of travel to the markets where they don't consider the exact price that the production should cost. Gennsi is sure of the quality of his products and that is why he always finds the best bidder \"if I just sell at what they offer I can't make what my harvests are worth\", he affirms. That is why he always seeks to have wholesale purchasing friends. With time, he hopes to buy his own land and plant in large quantities. He also wants to build his house in the city, because he is planning on starting a family. This is his third loan with MFP, and since he is a member of the board of directors, he likes to work actively in his community group and for the other members to participate. With the loan he is asking for, he will buy 20 sacks of fertilizer to protect his plantings, as well as hire workers. \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ellen Donohue, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":542078,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy 20 bags of fertilizer and to hire workers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-05-19T20:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1075,"lender_count":35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gennsi ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-05-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":3000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1075}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":1075,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:01:22Z","rounded_local_amount":3054.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182588122}],"funded_date":"2010-05-20T01:26:37Z","paid_date":"2010-12-15T15:01:22Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ellen Donohue","image":541577}},{"id":205676,"name":"Agueda Rosa","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Solicitante con buenas referencias, se dedica al alquiler de cochera para mottotaxis, en una casa de su propiedad.Sus clientes con propietarios de motos de la zona.

She tells us, \"I began to work when I was 37 years old selling quinoa and maca pancakes.  Later I had to change my business to selling beer from my house, owing to the fact that I had to raise my small child, and he needed my care.  I continued selling cakes and pudding that I prepared in my house and offered to the residents of my area.  Later I was encouraged to make dishes such as chicken soup, chaufa (a Peruvian rice dish),  spaghetti with beef, and to sell soft drinks; these dishes are preferred by the people in my neighborhood.   This business was a great help during the 6 months when my husband was not able to work. With him, I pay for the food expenses for my family and help with part of the educational expenses for my children, two of whom are professionals.  Over time I acquired a sandwich cart; my daughter works with it and helps us with the some of the household expenses.  Now I continue to sell food and prepare cakes and puddings.  I will invest this loan to redo a floor in my house so that my diners can feel comfortable.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

Gonz\u00e1lez lives in the center of the municipality of Axochiapan in the state of Morelos, Mexico.  She is 70 years old and did not undertake basic education.  She has a grocery store.  She will use the loan from Kiva and Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad to supply her business.  She is going to buy mainly basic items to sell in her store.  In addition to basic items, she sells sodas, snacks, toys, and gifts for all occasions.  Her store is called \"Tienda Mary\" (\"Mary's Store\").  She has been in business for 20 years.  She tells us that she started the business out of necessity upon becoming a widow, when she had to provide for her children.  She began by doing washing and ironing, but as this did not bring in enough, she decided to learn to make cheese and cream.  The family's economic situation became bearable when she decided to also sell a few groceries outside of her house on a little table.  Bit by bit, she added more products.  She bought a refrigerator and began to sell sodas, and in this way her business grew.  Later, a neighbor told her about the loans from Kiva and Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad, and she thought it was a good opportunity to give her business a bigger push.  Afterwards, she bought the land where she currently lives and where she has her business.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda is a widow and has 4 daughters and 1 son, all married and independent.  They help her by giving her money periodically for her expenses and sometimes they invest in her store.  She is full of pride at the fact that everything she has she acquired with the fruits of her labor, and therefore she enjoys serving her customers each day and doing all of the tasks needed in her store.  On average, she has 50 customers a day.  She thinks her business is profitable because her customers find everything there, and because she provides them with good service.  One of the challenges facing her business is the increase in competition, but she notes that even with everything, she is doing well.  She normally invests the earnings from her business in more merchandise, and she is planning to enlarge her store by buying more display cases to exhibit more merchandise and serve her clients better.  She plans to achieve a significant part of those plans with loans from Kiva and Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad.  \r\n\r\nShe likes her town a lot because, as she herself says, \"...that's why I like my town (Axochiapan), because it's a place for businesses, everything one could offer is for sale...\"  She is happy about the granting of the loan because it will enable her to achieve her goals.  Her words for the Kiva team are: \"...I thank them for the loan they made me, and may they help more people...\"\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":825,"image":{"id":684403,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To buy soap, bleach, crates of eggs, sodas, purified water, snacks","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"AXOCHIAPAN MOR.","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2011-01-05T03:10:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":825,"lender_count":27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-12-15T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":825,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-29T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2011-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2011-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2011-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2011-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2011-03-09T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2011-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2011-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":103.13},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":103.12},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":103.13},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":103.12},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":103.13},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":103.12},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":103.13},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":103.12}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":310.64,"local_amount":3765.32,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T03:44:17Z","rounded_local_amount":3807.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191430817},{"amount":206.34,"local_amount":2501.13,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:44:59Z","rounded_local_amount":2528.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195850070},{"amount":206.34,"local_amount":2501.13,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:10:44Z","rounded_local_amount":2528.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201292344},{"amount":101.68,"local_amount":1232.42,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:09:11Z","rounded_local_amount":1246.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206160602}],"funded_date":"2011-01-08T07:02:20Z","paid_date":"2011-05-15T11:09:11Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Karen Ohrenberger","image":null}},{"id":267139,"name":"Crice","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Crice would like a loan to purchase a motorcycle.

He has no hired help so he is the only one who cares for the crops, which he does every day from very early in the morning.  One of the disadvantages of the region is that it's very good for this type of crop so there is a lot of competition, but he does manage to sell all of his production.\r\n\r\nThe loan Oscar is requesting will be used to buy fertilizer and to begin adapting his land technologically little by little.  With the help of the loan his crops will be of better quality.\r\n\r\nHis goal is to increase production and give his family a better lifestyle.  This is his first term in FAMA and he is committed to paying back the loan on time so the organization will continue helping him with future loans."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":868095,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy fertilizer.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"Patuca, Olancho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15 -86.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":168,"posted_date":"2011-09-29T07:40:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Oscar Alonso ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-08-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":10000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":550}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":550,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-29T08:38:47Z","rounded_local_amount":10384,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257165431}],"funded_date":"2011-09-29T11:46:55Z","paid_date":"2012-02-29T08:38:47Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sherry Bess","image":833485}},{"id":345024,"name":"Z\u00e9nabou","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Z\u00e9nabou est une femme  \u00e2g\u00e9(e) de 25 ans.

from Tanzania! Magdalena M. is twenty-seven years old. She is married with two children, ages one and five. She also has an additional dependent who lives with her because he is an orphan. In 2004, Magdalena established a business selling traditional African cloth that is used by local women to fashion their traditional outifts, called \"vitenge.\" Magdalena runs her shop with the assistance of one employee and earns monthly profits of 400 USD. She is requesting a loan of 875 USD in order to purchase additional cloth and dye to manufacture this African traditional cloth. In the future, she hopes to make enough profit to open another business.\r\n<P>\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of microcredit in Tanzania. The organization is devoted to the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through microfinance as a practical way to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women. Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets; because of this, they are deemed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support, hence poor access to basic needs and services. When a client needs working capital to buy a specific item, SELFINA buys the equipment for said client and extends a loan to her. The same equipment is then leased back to the client so they can use it while in process of paying back their loan, a process called a sale-and-leaseback arrangement. Once the loan has been repaid, SELFINA transfers the ownership of the equipment to the client. The advantage of microleasing over traditional microfinance loans is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":875,"image":{"id":192708,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"To buy cloth in bulk for her business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Dar es Salaam","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-6.8 39.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-08-30T17:40:34Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":875,"lender_count":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Magdalena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-09-13T19:35:47Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":1000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":875,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2008-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2008-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":88,"local_amount":100571.43,"processed_date":"2008-10-11T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-21T07:17:59Z","rounded_local_amount":101904,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356222},{"amount":87,"local_amount":99428.57,"processed_date":"2008-11-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T04:19:00Z","rounded_local_amount":100746,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5347975},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2008-12-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:09:09Z","rounded_local_amount":101325,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9970549},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-01-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:13:25Z","rounded_local_amount":101325,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14886766},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-02-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:02:28Z","rounded_local_amount":101325,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20436026},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-03-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:54:58Z","rounded_local_amount":101325,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130299},{"amount":87.49,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-04-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:23:13Z","rounded_local_amount":101325,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027130},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-05-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:12:56Z","rounded_local_amount":101325,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613170},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-06-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:01:03Z","rounded_local_amount":101325,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010253},{"amount":87.51,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-07-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:37:49Z","rounded_local_amount":101325,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63232564}],"funded_date":"2008-08-30T19:35:47Z","paid_date":"2009-08-15T18:37:49Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":65538,"name":"Tatyana","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Tatyana is an entrepreneur from Kherson where she sells knitted wear for children in the local Dneprovskyi market.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She owns a business venture, planting & harvesting  a variety of vegetables for sale.  Momoe has 3 years of experience in this business.  Momoe needs a loan of WST $1000 to purchase additional seeds, seedlings & young crops to raise.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 100 tala or US $42 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\n\nIn 2009, Momoe joined SPBD.    This is her 1st loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Momoe's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\n\nThe following social metrics for Momoe S. are provided by SPBD*:\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.87 out of 3\nLevel of Education:                              2.12 out of 3\nLevel of total Household Income:         2 out of 3\nQuality of Household Assets:              1.52 out of 3\n\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\n\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/www.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\n\nAbout SPBD\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\n\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

","en":"Born in en 1977 in Akpro-Miss\u00e9r\u00e9t\u00e9 (Ou\u00e9m\u00e9 county), Ms. K. Christine has lived for seven years in Agbalilam\u00e8, in Cotonou, the economic capital of Benin.  Married to Mr. NOUNAGNON Pascal, a chauffeur, she is the mother of four children, who are all in school.  She lives together with her children and husband.  The couple jointly ensures that family expenses are covered.\r\n\r\nChristine never attended school.  About two years ago, she got started in food catering.  To help out her husband, she basically goes from place to place selling fried bananas, as well as fried taro.  She supplies herself at the Ouando market in Porto-Novo, the administrative capital of Benin.  \r\n\r\nShe once obtained an ALID\u00e9 loan, and she repaid the aforementioned loan.  The stock of goods that she sells is no longer enough right now for satisfying all her customers.  In addition, she doesn't have the financial means to increase her stock of goods and to do better in satisfying her entire customer base.  These are the reasons why Christine is requesting a second loan from ALID\u00e9.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva

She is a single mother of two children, who are 7 and 5 years old, and both attend school. She only attended through 2nd grade and did not continue due to her parents' lack of finances. She lives in her own home with her family and she does not support anyone else besides her children. <p>\r\n\r\nShe left her birth city for Inhambane to pursue better living conditions. Ten years later, she returned to Matola. She has a business raising chickens and has done this for more than 12 years. She doesn't have any employees and earns about 5,000MT monthly, which she applies to her household expenses and still saves some to her bank account. \r\n\r\n<p>\r\nShe has never taken out a loan with another bank. She came to know Hluvuku through her sister who had already received a loan from the institution. This is her first loan for the amount of 25,000MT, which she plans to use to purchase feed and vitamins to increase the quantity of her stock. She promises to repay this loan dutifully to be able to access others. In the future she hopes to seek more loans to expand her aviaries to fit more chickens. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Michelle Harrison, Kiva

Vaisidin is 42 years old. He is married and has five children. His wife is a housewife and the business of Vaisidin is the main source of income for his large family. \r\n\r\nVaisidin has been providing transportation services for the last 7 years. At the same time he sells construction materials at the market. Vaisidin is dreaming all of his children being well-educated so he is working hard. As a result the business generates significant income allowing him to support his large family. \r\n\r\nIn order to provide the better service for his clients and in that way earn more, Vaisidin needs to make major repairs on his lorry. He believes that this will make his business more profitable. With this purpose in mind, he requests 1500 USD. With part of the loan he will also buy construction materials to increase the range of goods he sells.\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

SPBD's loans are Kemeta's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Kemeta N. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.8 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.55 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         2.3 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2.3 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/www.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

Tolibboy is 53 years old and lives in Istaravshan town with his wife who helps him with the living expenses since she is a shop keeper. Tolibboy has four sons who also help him. For 15 years, Tolibboy has worked his land which produces potatoes and carrots. At the same time, he raises cattle in his house. His greatest dream is to be able to establish more crops so that he can leave equal parts to his children. He started farming when his parents taught him to work in this way. Tolibboy is requesting financing to buy supplies for his crops in order to get a good yield and sell more in the market. With part of the loan, he will also purchase calves.\r\n\r\n<b>More about Tajikistan and IMON International:<\/b>\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its epic mountain passes and its rich history which includes its place as a key post along the Silk Road and events at the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has produced famous thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. A civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged an already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural productivity and the manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent viable business prospects.
