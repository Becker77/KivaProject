She is a very selfless and hard-working woman. She is separated from her partner and lives with 3 of her 7 children. For more than 15 years she has been making and selling tamales (a traditional dish). When her children are available, the youngest is in charge of grinding the corn, she kneads the dough, and her other children wrap the tamales in banana leaves.\r\n\r\nTo handle all of this work, Maribel used to get up at 2:00am in order to prepare 400 to 500 tamales and distribute them to her wholesale buyers at 8:00am. With this work she was able to feed and educate all of her children, so she was very happy with it, but due to all of the effort, she began to experience muscle pains, and now she only prepares 300 tamales in the afternoons. \r\n\r\nOne of Maribel's difficulties is that her oldest daughter left with her partner and failed to repay a debt, which Maribel has assumed. Once this debt has been repaid, she wants to update her corn grinder, as the one she currently uses does not help her to speed up her work.\r\n\r\nThis is Maribel's fifth loan with MFP.

There are 12 women and 3 men in the group, and they live in the same area.  Most of the members have a business, and others are going to start a new one.  Most importantly, they have what it takes to get ahead.\r\n\r\nMasemia sells empanadas and soft drinks.  She also sells cosmetics by catalog.  She is married, and her husband works in transportation.  She wants to be able to put more capital into her empanada sales.  That is the reason she needs the loan.\r\n\r\nShe has a small child, and she lives in her husband\u2019s parents\u2019 house.  She wishes to be able to have savings.  In the near future she wants to be able to have her own house.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the women sell food, meat, hamburgers, cosmetics, or provide domestic services.  Some of the men work in passenger transportation, and the others are employed by the Guabira factory.  All of the members have many years of experience in their fields.\r\n\r\nThe competition in the market that the members work in is not high, but the sales are not very satisfactory.  Therefore, they see the need to change markets to be able to get better earnings.  Many of the members who are domestic employees want to be able to open a business that would allow them to be closer to their families.\r\n\r\nThat is the reason that they need a loan, which would serve as working capital.  In other cases the loan is to increase their merchandise or buy replacement parts for their vehicles, which they use for work.\r\n\r\nMost of the members had only heard about these group loans.  But, they are enthusiastic about this economic support, which they will use to be able to work and to give their families a better quality of life.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":1800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":532241,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Operating capital","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-17 -65","type":"point"}},"partner_id":73,"posted_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:41Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":3100,"lender_count":33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Masemia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Cinthia Ester","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Pura","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nancy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Rene","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mary Luz","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elva","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Luciano","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatima","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maby Ysabel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Natividad","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lorenzo Antonio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Roxana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tatiana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Cristhian","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":22000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":3100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1735.28},{"due_date":"2010-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1737.19},{"due_date":"2010-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1757.43},{"due_date":"2010-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1777.97},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1798.67},{"due_date":"2010-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1819.65},{"due_date":"2010-06-29T07:00:00Z","amount":1840.91},{"due_date":"2010-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1862.42},{"due_date":"2010-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1884.15},{"due_date":"2010-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1906.14},{"due_date":"2010-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1928.32},{"due_date":"2010-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":1951.87}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":244.52},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":244.78},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":247.64},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250.53},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":253.45},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":256.41},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":259.4},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":262.43},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":265.49},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":268.6},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":271.71},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":275.04}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ginny Kalish"}},{"id":201224,"name":"Faty Arelle","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Faty Arelle S. est une femme de 43 ans, elle est c\u00e9libataire et m\u00e8re de 02 enfants.

She is 46 years old. Dady is married and has five small children. To make a living, Dady owns and operates a business venture in the food sector, specifically, selling \"buko\" or young coconut in the local community. Dady has been engaged in her business for over 22 years and earns approximately 4,500 PHP a month from this activity.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2008, Dady joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services. She wished to help improve her living situation and increase her ability to engage in business activities. Dady has successfully repaid a previous loan of 3,000 PHP from GDMPC. \r\n<p>\r\nDady is requesting a new loan of 7,000 PHP, which will be used to buy \"buko\" to sell. This loan will be the second loan taken out by Dady from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement the family's income. \r\n<p>\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n<p>\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.\r\n<p>\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She lives in her own home with her 17 year old son Miguel, for whom she wants to provide a good college education.  She sells handmade fabrics from her vending post at La Explanada Laguna Temporal (a place where fairs are held in the city of Juliaca).  Among the customers that visit her business are international tourists, who are on their way to the city of Puno but stop in Juliaca to buy souvenirs.  Juana says the best part of her job is weaving her fabrics by hand because it gives her great joy.  She has been in business for 20 years and the hardest part is having to spend the entire day at her post without being able to take a few moments to relax.  In the future, she would like to open a handmade clothing store where she can sell her merchandise in a calmer environment.\r\n<p>\r\nJuana is seeking her first loan with MFP and expects to make her payments on time without any problems.  She hopes to access more loans in the future.  With her loan of 3000 soles, she will buy more wool in order to increase the amount of clothing she has in stock.  \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1025,"image":{"id":383327,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Weaving","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"Purchase wool","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Juliaca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15.5 -70.133333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-09-05T11:40:12Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1025,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-08-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":199.91},{"due_date":"2009-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":207.91},{"due_date":"2009-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":212.7},{"due_date":"2009-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":227.96},{"due_date":"2010-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":233.85},{"due_date":"2010-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":238},{"due_date":"2010-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":257.27},{"due_date":"2010-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":263.02},{"due_date":"2010-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":273.54},{"due_date":"2010-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":283.27},{"due_date":"2010-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":296.62},{"due_date":"2010-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":305.95}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.3},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71.04},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.67},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":77.89},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.9},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.31},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.9},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.87},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.46},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.78},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":101.35},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.53}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":68.3,"local_amount":199.91,"processed_date":"2009-09-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:36:40Z","rounded_local_amount":200.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87081306},{"amount":71.31,"local_amount":208.7,"processed_date":"2009-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:18:35Z","rounded_local_amount":209.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96997460},{"amount":72.4,"local_amount":211.91,"processed_date":"2009-11-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:54:53Z","rounded_local_amount":212.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103842805},{"amount":289.9,"local_amount":848.48,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T21:06:16Z","rounded_local_amount":852.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734382},{"amount":37.1,"local_amount":108.6,"processed_date":"2010-03-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:32:53Z","rounded_local_amount":109.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128992400},{"amount":89.87,"local_amount":263.02,"processed_date":"2010-04-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:37:25Z","rounded_local_amount":264.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136717242},{"amount":93.46,"local_amount":273.54,"processed_date":"2010-05-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:39:27Z","rounded_local_amount":274.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144751019},{"amount":96.78,"local_amount":283.27,"processed_date":"2010-06-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:02:37Z","rounded_local_amount":284.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151933657},{"amount":102.79,"local_amount":300.86,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:37:07Z","rounded_local_amount":302.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159672593},{"amount":103.09,"local_amount":301.71,"processed_date":"2010-08-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:39:18Z","rounded_local_amount":303.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166886469}],"funded_date":"2009-09-05T14:49:52Z","paid_date":"2010-09-15T10:39:18Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ronan Reodica","image":498323}},{"id":138975,"name":"Diane","description":{"languages":["fr"],"texts":{"fr":"S.

She is married and has 3 children aged 28, 25, and 20.  \r\n\r\nIn 1998, she established  her small store business.  Working 7 days a week and 8 hours a day, she supoorts her family.  She has already received and successfully repaid 5 loans from Patan BPW and used her most recent to purchase additional inventory for her small store. In the future, Shanti plans to continue adding inventory and expanding her business.  She thanks you for your support.\r\n\r\nIn the Kathmandu Valley, the small grocery store, called a pasal, is an important part of the local economy.  Fresh produce, milk, and staples such as rice, lentils, and flour are purchased daily for cooking in the home.  Owners of small grocery stores use Kiva loans to increase their purchasing power and profit margains.  By keeping inventory strong and purchasing in larger amounts, owners of these small stores are able to increase profitability.  While a typical pasal might be no more than 100 sq. feet, they are always full of bargaining customers, incoming produce, and shrewd businesswomen. \r\n\r\nThis loan was administered by Kiva's local partner MFI, Patan Business and Professional Women. Patan BPW became Kiva's first field partner in Nepal in 2007.  Patan BPW operates throughout the Kathmandu Valley, offering microcredit and business training programs to low-income women.  In addition to providing economic opportunity to their clients, Patan BPW seeks to empower Nepali women within the home and community.  \r\n\r\nFor more information about Patan BPW, visit our partner

The region is known for its commerce, its traditional feast days of San Pedro and San Pablo, and  for its happy population. \r\n\r\nRosa is the treasurer of the community bank and it is in her house that the meetings occur. She,  together with a few other colleagues, used to belong to a different community bank but they  decided to break away to form their own. This will be their first loan cycle as a group. She has three children and she lives with her boyfriend. He is a taxi driver. \r\n\r\nShe sells all kinds of clothing, selling her products on order. She has many clients and they  order her products especially because she offers them flexible payment methods. She collects  payments on the weekends, a great advantage to her because when she picks up a payment she  \r\nalways makes new sales. She works on the weekends with the help of her boyfriend. She purchases  her merchandise once a month in the city of Guayaquil, location where she finds the best  selection. Seventy percent of this loan will be used to purchase ladies' clothing and the rest will be used  to purchase men's clothing. \r\n\r\nHer dream is to purchase a car to help her make her sales. <br

The loan consultant who has been working with Evelyn has described her as a hardworking entrepreneur with a pleasant disposition. She has been working in her sales business over the past two years with the assistance of her aunt, and has observed that making sales to members of her community is an effective way to earn an income without neglecting her family responsibilities, because she can set her own work schedule. Evelyn also consults her husband before making serious business decisions. This will be her 1st loan with Fundaci\u00f3n Mujer. \r\n\r\nEvelyn has a business of selling women\u00b4s clothing. The majority of her clients are friends, acquaintances and neighbors who live in her community. Her general routine is to wake up early and take care of domestic tasks such as cooking and cleaning. When the first part of her work day is complete, she gets ready to head out into the community, dedicated to the activities of her business, such as making sales, collecting payments or purchasing merchandise. When she is out, she relies on her mother to take care of her baby. \r\n\r\nEvelyn has the goal of earning enough income from her sales activity that she would be able to open a store or central location from which to sell items. Her main obstacle is a lack of the working capital necessary for making investments in clothing merchandise. Evelyn hopes to use this loan to purchase various women\u00b4s clothing items such as sports clothes and casual wear.

L., 45, has decided to prepare for the future. She was not able to make it to high school, but she stamped it on her mind that not graduating from a college is only a small part of her history. Lorna is married to Ibarra, a store owner. They live in Tondo, Manila, where they are raising their only child, who is now in elementary school.\r\n\r\nLorna co-runs a residential sari-sari (variety) store with Ibarra. Here, they buy sacks of rice and sugar and sell it retail. The rice is sold per kilo, while the sugar is repacked into pouches of usually a half kilo each. Lorna has been in business for twenty years, and they run their present sari-sari store without hiring any employees. Monthly they earn around Php 9,000.\r\n\r\nBecause she believes that her business has a future, she decided to borrow Php 14,000 to help her grow her business. She will use this loan money to purchase more sacks of rice and sugar. Lorna will make sure that her products are always available for her customers. Also, part of the loan money will go for the schooling of her child.\r\n\r\nLorna mentions having difficulties with customers who incur debts and with competitors in the area. However, she sees the future positively, when these difficulties are met with corresponding solutions.

Victoriana and her husband sacrifice a lot so they can continue sending their youngest child to school so that someday she will be able to finish college. \r\n\r\nAilene, their youngest, is a working student in order to support her studies and to lessen her parents\u2019 sacrifices. Victoriana sells the fish, caught by her husband, in their village. She roams around their village or goes to the market of Iguig to sell the fish. Her husband is a fisherman and she assists him in providing for the family\u2019s basic needs. Victoriana is asking for a loan amounting to PHP 12,000 ($250US) to buy fish nets to make her husband's fishing easier. The loan will be of great help to increase their income. That amount will really help them to improve their daily finances.\r\n\r\n

life. For this reason, she works daily in the fields tending and harvesting vegetables that she sells in the market. A lot of the time the chores in the fields result in little compensation, and so recently she set up a sales post in her home for fruits and candy. This allows her to tend to her home as well. Nazokat wishes to have more capital to invest in her work so that she can increase her income and improve her beloved children's well-being. She will use this loan to buy seeds and mineral fertilizer. \n\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

He is 62 years old, married, and the father of 7 children with ages between 10 and 40 years old.  Only the three youngest are in school.\r\n\r\nAlberto left Gaza when he was a child for the capital, Maputo, in search of work.  He began working for a Portuguese official as domestic help.  Due to his dedication to his work the Portuguese was able to arrange a spot for him in one of the official schools, and he finished the 6th grade in the old system.\r\n\r\nYears later his boss returned to Portugal, and he was left unemployed.  He went to South Africa and worked in the mines, but due to the death of his brother during an excavation of a mine, his father demanded Alberto to leave that line of work claiming it was too dangerous.  He came to live with his sister who lived in the town of Namaacha which borders Swaziland.\r\n\r\nTwo years later he was able to arrange a job as a cargo loader, and because his dedication and force of will he was promoted to the manager of STIVA.  For 20 years he earned a monthly sum of 25,000MT, but when he was advised of his retirement he immediately constructed a stand in his home.\r\n\r\nToday he is retired and earns a monthly sum of 8,500MT which does not satisfy his necessities.  During a conversation with his wife, who is our client, he learned of our services and solicited a loan in the amount of 15,000MT to strengthen his business.  The impact of his activity is notorious.  He provides basic products to the community reducing the distances people previously covered in search for the same service.\r\n\r\nHe travels one time each week, and he is the only one with a stand and also because he has transportation.  He has earned 2,500MT and is able to save 1,000MT, and that has helped in the critical moments of his business.  Besides his children he is not responsible for anyone else.  This is his first loan with Hluvuku and with Kiva.  The 15,000MT will be used to increase the volume of his business.  He is confident that he will pay off the loan before the due date and request another loan to begin raising chickens.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Jared Wandry, Kiva

In the future, Agnes hopes to buy two sewing machines for designing bedsheets to sell.\r\n\r\nAbout BRAC:\r\nBRAC's holistic approach to poverty alleviation and empowerment of the poor encompasses a range of core programs in economic and social development, health, education, human rights, and legal services which are delivered through an extensive network of village organizations.

She also rents out a room, which has been a great help to be able to pay household expenses.\r\n\r\nHer husband works in construction, but in Costa Rica, along with her four sons. They are working there because the work situation became difficult in their country they had to find a solution.

Only one daughter lives with her.\r\n\r\nShe wants this loan in order to buy stone, sand, cement and iron, to finish building a wall that is partly built out of zinc.

She is 47 years old, married to Antonio Q., and blessed with 4 children, 3 of whom are school-aged and one who is already married. To make a living, she is presently engaged in a crab-dealing business. She is also receiving support from her husband, who is a fisherman. She\u2019s been engaged in the crab-dealing business for 15 years. Together with her husband, she is earning at least 3,500 PHP. \r\n\r\nJust this year, Patricia joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Patricia, as a newly recognized member of PMPC under the Regular Loan Program, is requesting 5,000 PHP as her first loan, which will be used for additional capital for her existing crab-dealing business. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family, especially in meeting their basic needs, savings for future use, loan repayments, her children\u2019s education and possible business expansions.\r\n\r\n About PMPC:\r\n Paglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model. \r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

A despensa  is very similar to a small grocery. Her store provides a variety of basic staples to the people in her neighborhood. Before opening her despensa she sold fruit. Little by little she augmented her stock and now runs her despensa  which offers everything from fruit to meat or sodas and dairy products. <p>\r\nFor many years Antanacia was unable to work full time because she was constantly caring for her son who was in and out of hospitals. However, now that her children are older they are more independent. <p>\r\nWith the work she puts into her store she has been able to expand quickly.

As she did these businesses, she also leant more experience from other people.

In addition, her husband contributes his salary to the family's income, which makes her family's economy stable.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

It has produced famous thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, such as Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. A civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged an already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural productivity and the manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent viable business prospects. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Since her childhood, she has worked in diverse activities in the land, both in growing crops and raising livestock. In this way she has seen, throughout the years, both rewards and failures, but in spite of this she puts great effort into being a farmer. For this reason, she wakes up very early every day to take her cows to the fields to feed and later works on her gardens. But when it is time to sow or harvest, every member of her family participates unanimously to obtain good results. The products that Senobia grows are mainly potato, corn and wheat, which are the products in greatest demand in her region.\r\n\r\nThis is her 15th loan with MFP.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from raising pigs for sale. Lucila has been engaged in her business for over 1 years and earns approximately 10000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Lucila joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Lucila has successfully repaid a previous loan of 20000 PHP from GDMPC. Lucila is requesting a new loan of 35000 PHP which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This loan will be the sixth loan taken out by Lucila from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.

It has produced famous thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. A civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged an already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural productivity and the manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent viable business prospects.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the USSR, further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007 IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She works for periods every day because sometimes she doesn\u2019t have anyone to leave the children with and they are still little so her situation sometimes becomes quite complicated but she hangs in there struggling to get ahead every day and progressing in her business.  She sells door to door and through prior orders.  She sells on credit and collects weekly.  She says she loves to sell.

It is based on that fact that he has requested a Kiva loan to buy more cows for re-sale to double the sales and  profits.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":871940,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy more cows to re-sell.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Kihihi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"2 33","type":"point"}},"partner_id":84,"posted_date":"2011-09-18T14:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1075,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kirungi","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-08-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":3000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":1075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2011-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2011-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2012-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2012-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2012-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2012-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2012-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2012-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2012-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2012-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2012-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":250000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":89.58},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":89.59},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":89.58},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":89.58},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.59},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.58},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.58},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.59},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.58},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.58},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.59},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.58}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":89.58,"local_amount":250000,"processed_date":"2011-10-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-16T09:30:47Z","rounded_local_amount":251281.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238868720},{"amount":89.59,"local_amount":250000,"processed_date":"2011-11-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-06T09:21:45Z","rounded_local_amount":251281.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244648556},{"amount":89.58,"local_amount":250000,"processed_date":"2011-12-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-02T09:26:41Z","rounded_local_amount":251281.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":251313893},{"amount":89.58,"local_amount":250000,"processed_date":"2012-01-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:43:47Z","rounded_local_amount":251281.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257275489},{"amount":89.59,"local_amount":250000,"processed_date":"2012-02-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-28T08:04:11Z","rounded_local_amount":251281.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":264223612},{"amount":89.58,"local_amount":250000,"processed_date":"2012-03-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-10T08:12:59Z","rounded_local_amount":251281.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270319228},{"amount":89.58,"local_amount":250000,"processed_date":"2012-04-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-03T08:27:40Z","rounded_local_amount":251281.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276947343},{"amount":447.92,"local_amount":1250000,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-02T08:26:22Z","rounded_local_amount":1256406.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283315523}],"funded_date":"2011-09-24T12:47:30Z","paid_date":"2012-08-02T08:26:22Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":340614,"name":"Muliki","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Muliki is a 44-year-old married woman with 7 children and she owns a house in Kasese, Uganda.

But it's indeed a challenge for the couple to make effort in making a living especially in sending them to school.\n\nBecause they wanted to buy additional materials for fishing like fishing nets, they requested a loan from  Paglaum MPC in the amount of Php 20,000. They set aside an amount for the fishing accessories and at the same time to put up additional capital for their little sari-sari store.  A back-to-back business actually to make a daily income.  Luzminda has 2 productive years of membership to Paglaum. Aside from the financial assistance they received, they also enjoyed other benefits like insurance and savings.

children.  He has run a coffee shop since 2005.\r\n<p>\r\nImad requests a loan of $700 from Al Majmoua to purchase merchandise for his shop like \u201cNarguileh\u201d and coal.  Nargileh (also known as \u201cShisha\u201d in Egypt) is an ancient tradition enjoyed by the people of the Middle East.  A water pipe is used to smoke fruit flavored tobacco.  Nargileh is enjoyed in cafes across the Middle East, and is beginning to gain popularity in the U.S, Europe and other countries.\r\n<p>\r\nThis is the first time Imad has requested a loan.  He is special in his work because his coffee shop is a nice and relaxing place.  He knows how to treat his clients.  When he first started his business, he didn\u2019t have a lot of cash and didn\u2019t have a lot of clients.

Her business is making traditional dresses.  She lives and works in the city of Khujand.  She leases a small factory at the Panshanbe market.

He works for the municipality in her area.  They have four children, but only one lives with them and is still dependent upon them.  The others are independent and have their own families.\r\n\r\nFor 17 years she has devoted herself to dressmaking.  She learned how to do this when she helped her aunt with her seamstress work.  Currently, Jacoba sews and makes clothes for women and children only.  She works at home, where she has the help of one of her nieces who cuts the fabric.  But, this is not the only activity Jacoba does.  She also is very good at cosmetology and cutting hair.  She has been doing that for 23 years, and she has regular customers.  What she likes the best about her work is giving the best of herself so that her customers feel satisfied.  Also, it is profitable because besides offering her services as a seamstress to various people, she also makes clothes that she sells herself.\r\n\r\nThis is her 13th loan with MFP.  What she likes about working with her communal bank is that her colleagues are good people.  They are supportive, and above all, they get along very well with each other.  She will use the money she is now asking for to buy fabric to make more clothes.  She will also get more supplies for her small beauty shop. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":403516,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Tailoring","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"Buy textile materials","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-10-11T15:20:14Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":250,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jacoba","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-09-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":700,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":106.49},{"due_date":"2009-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":108.99},{"due_date":"2009-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":114.15},{"due_date":"2010-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":118.72},{"due_date":"2010-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":123.13},{"due_date":"2010-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":128.52}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.03},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.93},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.77},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.4},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.97},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.9}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":38.03,"local_amount":106.49,"processed_date":"2009-10-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:04:04Z","rounded_local_amount":109.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96997655},{"amount":38.93,"local_amount":108.99,"processed_date":"2009-11-09T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:53:58Z","rounded_local_amount":112.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103843007},{"amount":117.73,"local_amount":329.63,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T21:07:21Z","rounded_local_amount":339.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734583},{"amount":9.41,"local_amount":26.37,"processed_date":"2010-02-08T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:48:45Z","rounded_local_amount":27.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123959677},{"amount":45.9,"local_amount":128.52,"processed_date":"2010-03-08T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:32:37Z","rounded_local_amount":132.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128992519}],"funded_date":"2009-10-11T21:56:16Z","paid_date":"2010-04-15T09:32:37Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ginny Kalish"}},{"id":147269,"name":"Jasmin","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jasmin takes good care of her rice field.

She lives peacefully at home with her husband Jhonny, who is 40 years old, and their three children:  Bryan (age 14), Jimena (age 6), and Florentino (age 10 months).  They live in a cramped house that they own in the mountains of Peru.\r\n<p>\r\nShe is a very hardworking woman who spends most of her day attending to her business from a rented location.  Nineteen years ago, Blanca decided to start a beauty salon where she honed her manual skills for styling the hair of clients who seek her services.  There are no other similar businesses like hers in the area, so she is able to generate very good revenues.\r\n<p>\r\nBlanca enjoys working at her salon, but she also manages to have time to look after her children.  A few months ago, she bought a few decorations to sell from her salon.  She keeps these items in a small display case, which was the start of a small bazaar.  Over time, this part of her business has grown as well.  She is able to cope with having two businesses because it allows her to stay ahead and provide the best for her family.  \r\n<p>\r\nThis is her first loan with MFP.  Blanca is very confident that she will be responsible in making each of her payments on time because she does not want to cause problems for the other members.  Her Communal Bank is a very organized group.  Blanca will use the loan to purchase equipment for her beauty salon to make her customers feel more comfortable.  In addition, she will buy merchandise for her decoration sales business.  \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":452976,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty Salon","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"Purchase equipment for her beauty salon & decorations to sell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-12-21T01:20:14Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":175,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Blanca","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-11-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":63,"local_amount":180,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-26T10:01:30Z","rounded_local_amount":181.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734984},{"amount":112,"local_amount":320,"processed_date":"2010-09-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:25:06Z","rounded_local_amount":322.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172153765}],"funded_date":"2009-12-21T04:48:11Z","paid_date":"2010-10-15T10:25:06Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ronan Reodica","image":498323}},{"id":167933,"name":"Angela","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Angela B., 57, is a hard working single mom.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

This Kiva borrower is receiving a new ELA loan.\r\n\r\nThe ELA program first provides disadvantaged adolescents, usually girls who are out of school, with livelihood training and financial literacy skills. Afterward, ELA participants can receive microfinance loans to expand their small businesses. These loans offer adolescents a unique chance to access finance at a young age and improve their prospects for the future, and target a segment of the population not typically served by traditional microfinance.\r\n\r\nKiva is privileged to partner with BRAC Uganda in posting these new loans, and give Kiva lenders the opportunity to fund deserving young entrepreneurs and support a promising new

He has a produce business, purchasing cereals like maize, rice and beans for reselling at a profit. He has been at it for the last 20 years.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He lives in Jabalia refugee camp located in Gaza in Palestine. He wants to change some home furniture and appliances and purchase new ones such as: refrigerator, washing machine, living room seats, etc., but the amount of money he has isn't enough to pay, so he wants to get a loan from FATEN. When Ibrahem gets the loan, he will be able to purchase new home furniture and appliances that he needs to live in better home conditions. Ibrahem is photographed in the FATEN branch.\r\n\r\nAbout this loan product:\r\n\r\n FATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

Years later, Gladys still works for that reason and because she enjoys cultivating the land. She gets up very early every day to tend to her usual chores in the field, in company of her inseparable partner during sowing season. The harsh cold weather that impacts the sierras of her country has damaged her crops in previous years and the expected income has always been affected. Nonetheless, she wishes to maintain the hopes of increasing her income with this activity, in order to see her six children prosper. For this reason she is thinking of increasing her selection of crops with a greater variety of seeds. Gladys is requesting a loan in order to meet her goals and thanks you for your collaboration.

Since 2004, Rehema has been running a grocery store, where she sells general items, including onions, tomatoes, chilli, oil, rice, and dried fish. Rehema's store is popular among the local people, especially at times when they need one or two missing ingredients for cooking the evening meal and don\u2019t have time to go all the way to the market.\n\nRehema works 9 to 12 hours a day, 6 days a week and is assisted by her husband. She currently needs a loan of TZH 770,000 in order to purchase additional inventory for her store, such as juice and soda. Rehema thanks everyone for supporting her.\n\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":223022,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Purchase of inventory in bulk for a grocery store","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Dar es Salaam","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-6.8 39.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-12-01T08:00:15Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rehema  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-11-21T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":700000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":77777.78},{"due_date":"2009-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":77777.78},{"due_date":"2009-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":77777.78},{"due_date":"2009-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":77777.78},{"due_date":"2009-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":77777.78},{"due_date":"2009-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":77777.78},{"due_date":"2009-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":77777.78},{"due_date":"2009-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":77777.78},{"due_date":"2009-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":77777.76}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":61.11},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":61.11},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":61.11},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":61.11},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.11},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.11},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.11},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.11},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.12}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":61.11,"local_amount":77777.78,"processed_date":"2008-12-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:12:28Z","rounded_local_amount":77910.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9970734},{"amount":61.11,"local_amount":77777.78,"processed_date":"2009-01-21T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:14:31Z","rounded_local_amount":77910.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14886951},{"amount":61.11,"local_amount":77777.78,"processed_date":"2009-02-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:03:30Z","rounded_local_amount":77910.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20436211},{"amount":61.11,"local_amount":77777.78,"processed_date":"2009-03-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:55:43Z","rounded_local_amount":77910.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130484},{"amount":61.11,"local_amount":77777.78,"processed_date":"2009-04-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:23:50Z","rounded_local_amount":77910.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027285},{"amount":61.11,"local_amount":77777.78,"processed_date":"2009-05-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:13:27Z","rounded_local_amount":77910.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613308},{"amount":61.11,"local_amount":77777.78,"processed_date":"2009-06-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:01:27Z","rounded_local_amount":77910.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010391},{"amount":61.11,"local_amount":77777.78,"processed_date":"2009-07-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:38:06Z","rounded_local_amount":77910.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63232702},{"amount":61.12,"local_amount":77777.76,"processed_date":"2009-08-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:52:12Z","rounded_local_amount":77910.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73664518}],"funded_date":"2008-12-08T22:00:56Z","paid_date":"2009-09-15T21:52:12Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Aiga Stokenberga","image":390110}},{"id":77546,"name":"Touch","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Touch P. is a villager in Sromouch Nor village in Takeo province.

He lives and works in Nakuru where he has had a private health practice since 1989. He provides reproductive health, curative services, family planning, PAK and minor surgeries. He is trained as a nurse, in family planning, and general reproductive health.<P>\r\n\r\nJohn sees between 140 and 150 clients a month. His clients range from those in the slum to more middle class people. He says it's important to balance his clientele as oftentimes the clients from the slum cannot pay their bills. He says he sometimes feels guilty but he cannot serve everyone all the time for free.<P>\r\n\r\nHe is asking for a loan so that he can repair his car that he uses to visit distant patients. The rest he will use for improvements to the clinic like painting, buying drugs, and repairing the floor. He said the most important aspect is the car, as many of his clients don\u2019t have the means to come to him.<P>\r\n\r\nNote: Mr. M.'s interview was taped prior to an informational meeting where he and other borrowers (all primary care providers) were informed that the maximum amount they could receive for their first loan was $1200 USD . Mr. Yegon agreed that he would take $1200 USD but the interviewer did not have time to re-tape the

She is 48 years old and has 5 children between the ages of 16-35.  The youngest three still attend school and she lives only with her children\u2014she doesn\u2019t have any other family members in her care.  She left Maputo after her father died.  She was very young and her mother did not have the resources to take care of her, so she was taken to Namaacha and cared for by the missionary nuns.  During her time with the nuns she learned to make handicrafts and crochet.  Years later, she met her husband and left her home with the nuns.  She began making crochet projects and selling them to co-ops.  Her work was often praised so she was able to start making large orders for a company in the capital city.  With the income from that project she bought some land.  Later, she separated from her husband and was left with 5 children to care for.  Her life was very difficult, but with the help of the missionaries she was able to overcome those difficulties.  They gave a base and she was able to build some rooms to rent out.  Today she is the owner of 5 small apartments, 2 of which are functioning and provide her with 1.500.00MT per month in rent money.  She is also the owner of two market stalls where she sells large orders of potatoes and onions which she gets from neighboring Swaziland for the price of 160x20 and 170x20, then resells in Namaacha for the price of 200x20 and 200x20.  She saves her money in a xitique (a traditional, rotating way of saving money).  She pays 1.000.00 MT every 15 days among 12 people and each person in the rotation collects the whole account once.  She has never worked with another lending company and this is her first loan with  Hluyuku and with Kiva.  The 20.000.00MT will be used to buy construction material for her apartments.  She is very anxious to finish them so she can begin other jobs.  She is full of projects!  In the future she plans on taking out another loan and becoming a great saleswoman.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Rachel Crouch, Kiva

ASHI is a microfinance institution and KIVA partner in the Philippines. Since then, she started selling ready-to-wear-clothes, which really helped to improve her family's standard of living. She is now seeking her fourth loan from ASHI, this time in the amount of 14,000 PHP ($325), to purchase additional inventory for her business. Specifically, the loan will be used to pay for blouses, shirts, sandals, jeans, short pants, and other supplies. She hopes that, with the help of ASHI and KIVA's field partners, she can reach her ambition to step out from poverty, expand her business, and pay for the needs of her two children in school. One of her dreams is to someday own their own house. <p>\r\n\r\nAbout ASHI: ASHI has the distinction of being the oldest existing replication of Grameen Bank's approach of providing credit to the poor people of the Philippines.

This school was opened in 1985 by the Catholic mission to educate the children of the Kolo Kolo community, on the outskirts of Makeni. Currently, the school is staffed with 12 teachers and has 550 pupils.\r\n\r\nThis is the second loan these teachers are accessing from SMT\/Kiva lenders.  School staff from this institution, like many other schools' staff within SMT\u2019s operational areas, come to SMT to apply for loans. With the help of these loans, they can accomplish certain tasks that they would otherwise not have been able to accomplish with their mere salaries alone. But with the help of this loan, some can pay school fees for their children; others can use the loan to buy pieces of furniture, a plot of land, house-building materials, or to invest in business. At the end of each month, these teachers can repay the loan out of their monthly salaries. The institution\u2019s bursar is directly responsible for deducting the repayment and pays SMT on their behalf.\r\n\r\nMabel C. who is pictured second from right is the leader of this group of teachers. The 43-year-old was born in Gbonkolenken village, in northern Sierra Leone. She is married to a teacher and they have 5 children \u2013 four of them are attending secondary school and one is in a tertiary institution.  Mabel, who has been a teacher for 24 years, is requesting a loan of SLL 1,200,000 in order to buy house-building materials like cement, iron, corrugated zinc, etc.\r\n \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1125,"image":{"id":506725,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":["Conflict Zones"],"use":"Buy house-building materials like cement, iron, corrugated zinc, etc.  ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SL","country":"Sierra Leone","town":"Makeni","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"8.883333 -12.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":57,"posted_date":"2010-03-16T16:40:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1125,"lender_count":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mabel ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Isatu ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hawanatu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kadiatu B.","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-11T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"SLL","disbursal_amount":4200000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":1125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":466666.67},{"due_date":"2010-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":466666.67},{"due_date":"2010-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":466666.67},{"due_date":"2010-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":466666.67},{"due_date":"2010-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":466666.67},{"due_date":"2010-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":466666.67},{"due_date":"2010-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":466666.67},{"due_date":"2010-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":466666.67},{"due_date":"2010-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":466666.64}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":125,"local_amount":466666.67,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:57:00Z","rounded_local_amount":474838.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":129012734},{"amount":3.57,"local_amount":13333.33,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:15:37Z","rounded_local_amount":13566.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151952857},{"amount":321.43,"local_amount":1200000,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:57:42Z","rounded_local_amount":1221012.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159692358},{"amount":175,"local_amount":653333.35,"processed_date":"2010-08-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:54:30Z","rounded_local_amount":664773.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166906572},{"amount":500,"local_amount":1866666.65,"processed_date":"2011-03-01T07:59:59Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T09:03:32Z","rounded_local_amount":1899353.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195913097}],"funded_date":"2010-03-16T20:59:58Z","paid_date":"2011-03-24T09:03:32Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}}]}
