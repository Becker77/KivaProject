They have two children, Elba aged 8 and Able aged 6. They are the reason why Alejandra and Teofilo work so hard; they wish to see their children grow up to make something of themselves and become a useful part of society. They live in their own house located in Pichari district.\r\n\r\nEver since she was a child, Alejandra has enjoyed helping her parents with any jobs they gave her, but her parents knew very little about economics. The store she used to run and which provided their income failed, and their agricultural business also fell through. Alejandra and her family had many problems but over time, they succeeded in overcoming them and with much sacrifice they now have a store where she sells clothing.\r\n\r\nAlejandra has now learned to be cautious with the business decisions she makes and is doing better. Sometimes she has assistance from Teofilo but usually she works on her own.

Her daily income varies from 2.000.00 and 2.300,00 MT. She has been in this business, which she  runs by herself, for 19 years.\r\n\r\nRosa heard about Hluvuku through friends. This is her second loan with Hluvuku, and the first with Kiva (she's never had loans with other institutions). These 18.000,00 MT will allow her to buy more blankets to answer the increase in demand during the upcoming winter months. She anticipates paying her loan back without difficulties, and plans to take other loans out in the future, to continue improving her business as well as to start a hair salon and build another house.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Aline Pereira, Kiva

In order to find an additional means of subsistence and support for her family, Asylkan started her business in cattle breeding. She bought cattle for fattening and reselling and concentrated all her efforts on supporting and expanding her household. Revenues from this activity allowed Asylkan to buy a small house in the village. Also she started to breed ducks, which became her favorite hobby.\r\n\r\nNow Asylkan wants to take a loan of 90,000 KGS to buy bull-calves for fattening and forage for cattle. With the revenues from this investment, Asylkan  plans to give a good education to her son. In the future, she plans to develop her farm by means of livestock breeding. As for her dreams, Asylkan is fond of American culture and wants to see Chicago some day. \r\n\r\nBai-Tushum and Partners uses Kiva funding to target the especially vulnerable population.

Rachel is requesting a new loan of 5000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Rachel from GDMPC.

She lives with her daughter\u2019s family in Novonikolaevka village. \r\nIn 1990, at the age of 20, Gulmira got married and became the mother of one daughter. Unfortunately, after seven years of happy marriage, her beloved husband died in car accident. In order to find means of subsistence for her small family, Gulmira started her business in cattle breeding. Using the money she had earned, in 2008 she bought a house in Novonikolaevka village with derelict grape bushes. As Gulmira had always dreamed to be engaged in land cultivating, she decided to revive a beautiful grape garden. Today, her garden consists of more than 200 bushes of grape in 11 different sorts. Such an assortment allows Gulmira to earn about more than 4,500 KGS in a month.  \r\nNow, in order to buy chemicals to manure land and get the system flowing, Gulmira has applied for a loan of 50,000 KGS. With the revenues, she plans to scale up her cultivated land and enlarge the number of grape bushes.

","en":"Leticia is 46 years old and is married to Patricio who is an elementary school teacher.  They have four children but only their daughter (a single mother) and their grandson Santiago, who is 4 years old, live with them.  Lety has taken care of Santiago since he was born since her daughter was studying and now she works as an accountant.\r\n\r\nLety is requesting this loan to invest in her business selling fine (gold) jewelry.  She buys her stock in the city of Morole\u00f3n Guanajuato since they offer her good prices in that city because she has been a customer for 12 years.  She can then raise the price just a little and not have to sell her jewelry for too high a price.  She tells us that she is putting a lot of effort into her work since she wants her son, who is studying Law, to be able to finish his degree and she wants to be able to buy him the textbooks he needs.\r\n\r\nRight now, one of Leticia's goals is to attract customers and sell to people who will be able to meet all their payments, above all people who have stable jobs.  One of her dreams is to hire premises and set her business up there since it is very dangerous to carry fine jewelry in the street.  Another one of her dreams is to repair her home since it leaks during the rainy season."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":746948,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Jewelry","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy fine (gold) jewelry","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Zitacuaro, Estado de Michoac\u00e1n.","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2011-04-22T12:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":525,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Leticia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-04-06T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":6000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2011-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2011-04-27T07:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2011-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2011-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2011-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2011-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2011-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2011-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2011-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2011-06-29T07:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2011-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2011-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2011-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2011-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":375}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.81},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.82},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.81},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.81},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.81},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.82},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.81},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.81},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.81},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.82},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.81},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.81},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.81},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.82},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.81},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.81}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":98.44,"local_amount":1125.3,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:08:54Z","rounded_local_amount":1158.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206160862},{"amount":164.04,"local_amount":1874.7,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:22:50Z","rounded_local_amount":1930.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211233743},{"amount":131.27,"local_amount":1500,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:12:20Z","rounded_local_amount":1544.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216512562},{"amount":131.25,"local_amount":1500,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-19T07:47:32Z","rounded_local_amount":1544.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":222223212}],"funded_date":"2011-04-22T18:58:28Z","paid_date":"2011-08-19T07:47:32Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Oxnard","image":null}},{"id":295953,"name":"Daniel","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Daniel has been in the \"Matatu\" transport business for the last seven years with an income of KES.20,000 per month.

She plans to use the profit from her business (estimated to be 350 WST per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Sale joined SPBD to gain access to financial services. Most of SPBD's clients are unable to borrow from commercial banks because they lack collateral. This is Sale's second loan with SPBD.

Meet John, a passionate and hardworking go-getter. He is based in Endebess, a remote village in Kitale, Kenya. This area is faced with hardcore poverty and very bad terrain. For the past three years, he has actively been involved in mixed farming and his primary source of income has been milk and eggs. John passionately loves farming, but the biggest challenge he faces is transportation of the products to the market and timely delivery. The Endebess area has poor roads and the terrain makes it even worse. He faces challenges transporting his produce, especially during the rainy seasons. John is seeking a loan to buy a motorbike. Because of poor feeder roads and bad terrain, this loan will assist him a great deal. Through the loan, he will be able to transport his produce from the farm and deliver it to the market on-time. Milk is very perishable and requires quick delivery to the market and through the loan, he will be able to make quick deliveries and never suffer losses. Eggs are very fragile and they require proper handling and through the motorbike, he will be able to transport his eggs using crates to the market.

He has been running his business of raising and selling cattle for 11 years. Adkhamjon tries to invest as much time as possible in his animals.

Without a doubt, the results please him: to be able to see clean and healthy animals is a big source of satisfaction. \r\n\r\nAdkhamjon now plans to invest the money that he is requesting in the purchase of a good breed of livestock to improve the quality of his animals.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

R. is 30 years old and a resident of Lourdes Col\u00f3n, which is located in the Department of La Libertad.  She lives with her lifelong partner and their only child who is two years old.  Dina sells clothing for men, women, and children at the municipal market in Lourdes Col\u00f3n.  She started this business more than five years ago because she wanted to join her husband in meeting the household expenses.  \r\n<p>\r\nDina is requesting a loan so that she can buy clothing in larger quantities, particularly the trendier clothes for young people because they are easier to sell.  Her business is vital since the stability of her household depends largely on the income that she is able to earn.  Dina says her family\u2019s wellbeing is her highest priority.  For this reason, she works each day from 8am until 6pm and offers her products to people who visit the market.  She hopes to generate better sales.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva

and overall economic growth. When a foreigner goes to any local market in Kyrgyzstan, he can see that the majority of shop assistants and sellers are women. This occurrence shows that old stereotypes about women as housewives have begun to disappear. \r\n\r\nBuraima M. is the leader of this group. She is sixty-four. Both she and her husband are retired. However, Buraima prefers to lead an independent life and therefore still makes her living by cattle breeding. Besides, she and her husband obtain a pension, which amounts to 4400 soms a month. She combines cattle breeding with farming as she also possesses a piece of land where she grows potatoes and cabbage. Another source of income comes from selling milk. \r\n\r\nBuraima\u2019s two sons are engaged in construction and sometimes help their mother in her activities. Due to these joint businesses, Buraima has successfully married off her sons and increased the total population of her livestock. Now Buraima needs a loan. She hopes that with this loan she will be able to buy two sheep. \r\n\r\nBuraima\u2019s partners:\r\n\r\nRukiahon B., 54, is a mother of four children. Two of her sons are working in Russia. To make a living, Rukiahon and her husband are engaged in farming. Her husband is an excavator driver. As for Rukiahon, she grows cotton on a piece of land. Rukiahon hopes to obtain this loan and purchase mineral fertilizers.\r\n\r\nZamira A., 51, has three children. Her husband works in Osh city. As for Zamira, she breeds cattle and does odd jobs. She manages to earn two \u2013 three dollars a day. Zamira has applied for this loan to make repairs on their house.\r\n\r\nSuvsara M., 76, is a widow. She lives with her grandchild and his wife. In her old age Suvsara continues to work and contributes to her family\u2019s income by raising livestock and growing cotton. She has two cows and obtains a pension. Suvsara needs this loan to purchase mineral fertilizers. \r\n\r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance, a young and ambitious socially-focused MFI in Kyrgyzstan.\r\n\r\nMol Bulak Finance is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development on the basis of 3-Ps concept - People (building human capital and taking care of its customers and the society as well), Profit (to be profitable to grow further) and the Planet (taking care of the environment).

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Malabuhan, Siaton, Negros Oriental. She earns her living by fishing and selling fish. Her husband, Vitaliano M., who is 45 years old, works as a fisherman to earn his living. He also helps in his wife's business activities. They have four children who range in age from 23 to 30 years old. Rebecca joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1999 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 16 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Rebecca has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 15,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 7,500, uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her 17th loan, she is borrowing PHP 14,500, which she intends to use as additional capital for her business selling fish. She continues to save up for future home repairs. Rebecca M. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Josephine has successfully repaid a previous loan of 7,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Josephine is requesting a new loan of 9,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase new items to expand her offering. This loan will be the third loan taken out by Josephine from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 38 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":623064,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To purchase new items to expand her product offering","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Brgy.

He breeds calves, cows and sheep. He is single and lives with his parents.\r\n\r\nKhairiddin's father was also a cattle breeder and from childhood he has gained rich experience in the livestock business, enabling him to improve his situation. \r\n\r\nNowadays, his biggest dream is to expand his business and to also to offer related products such as dairy products in the surrounding community.\r\n\r\nTherefore, his biggest need is to get a loan in order to buy more cows. Khairiddin is very grateful to everyone who is helping him to improve his living.  \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International:\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes having been a key post along the Silk Road and having witnessed the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to epic mountain passes, a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC, and communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still lives in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The couple has two children, both of whom are college students. She and her husband have worked hard but they had a very small income, and they didn't have enough capital to start up a business. \r\n\r\nIn 1997, Nancy heard about the Kiva field partner, ASHI, and began dreaming of having a stable life, a stable home and of starting a business. When she received her first and succeeding loans from ASHI, Nancy started her own business of selling fish in the local community. She has had this business for many years. Fish selling has been a great help to her family. As a busy entrepreneur, Nancy also embarked on a tricycle transport business (motorcycle with sidecar). Her husband, Eddie, manages this business.\r\n\r\nHowever, the demands of her family grow as years go by. She wants to have more businesses that can add to her present income so she will have bigger profits and savings. She had the idea of operating a sari-sari (variety) store. It has been great! Nancy is earning a good income and she wants to make a larger investment in it. On her 11th loan, she is proposing a new loan amounting 45,000 PHP to expand her growing variety store business.\r\n\r\nWith this kind of business, Nancy can still manage her previous business of fish selling, because either her children or her husband can operate their sari-sari (variety) store at home when she's away selling fish. Someday, as her income increases, she dreams of funding her children\u2019s education until they complete college degrees and have professional jobs. Her greatest dreams are to get out from the downward spiral of poverty and to have a happy life.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1025,"image":{"id":533131,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To expand her variety store by purchasing more groceries.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She has been in this business for 7 years and she considers the most difficult aspect of her work to be having to stay in her store all day waiting for customers.  Over time, she would like to set up another business.  She would like to break into the food business as she has seen that it is a good source of income.\r\n\r\nThis is Mar\u00eda's fifth loan with MFP.

Do\u00f1a Amelia is a widow with five children, but she lives alone.  She makes and sells Ocoshal crafts to people in her village who buy it for resale.  Sometimes she travels to Mexico City to sell her products.  She also grows avocados since she sees this is a good business.  She is requesting a loan to buy material for her crafts such as needles, thread and a large tub, as well as avocado plants and organic fertilizer that won't hurt the land.

She and one of her group have been with VisionFund since 2010 while the third member has just joined VisionFund.

It is set up at the meeting point between the mountainous and coastal regions of Ecuador.  Is it an exceptional spot, not just because of its ethnic richness, but also because of the scenery that can be found as soon as you enter this beautiful city.  Santo Domingo de los Colorados is part of the province of Santo Domingo de los Ts\u00e1chilas, which was only recently formed.  The main holiday in Santo Domingo is celebrated with a huge wave of visitors and cultural and commercial exchanges.  There is a huge fair at the Rancher's Association's facilities where they show and compete the best specimens of breeds and crossbreeds that are bred in the area's ranches.\r\n\r\nSusana has a grocery store in the Alluriquin neighborhood of her canton.  She started it on her own initiative four years ago and since then the store has been her only means of support.  She wants to take the next step and invest in shelves and products for her store.  By doing this she will maintain a larger clientele and thus generate more income.\r\n\r\nThe rise in prices in her country has been a huge obstacle for Susana, but she is very optimistic about her loan because her business has a great location.  Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa, which is the institution that will act as the intermediary for her loan and that will provide her with training and advice, has determined that Susana is a good customer with a low risk of defaulting.

He works the route between Dushanbe and Yavan.  This business brings in income, but to increase his earning and reduce the cost of each trip Saidbek wants to install equipment to reduce gasoline consumption.

married.  She has 2 sons.  Her eldest son is 5 years old and is in his third year of primary school.  Her younger son is 4 months old.  Recently, Brenda stopped her studies.  Her intention is to be able to continue to provide for her family, which she is able to do thanks to the income from her\r\nbusiness.  She wishes for her country's economy to improve, and hopes that this improvement would in turn improve her business so that she may achieve the success she needs.  Her dream is for God to grant her a long life so that she may be able to educate her grandchildren and see that they grow up knowing how to succeed professionally and how to handle the difficult situations that they may encounter in their lives.  In the more immediate future, Brenda wishes to move forward with her business, to no longer have sell her food as a street vendor, and to be able to sell her food from her home.  \r\n\r\nBrenda's business is selling the traditional food vigoron.  She sells it on the street, and has run her business for 2 years.  Brenda began her business on her own because the money that her husband earned was not sufficient to cover their household expenses.  Everything relied on the support of her family, who helped her with the business.  Her eldest son helped her to carry her food because she did not have anything that she could use to carry it when she went out to sell.  She and her son would walk the streets looking for customers who would appreciate her delicious vigoron.  Eventually she decided to get a cart to carry her food, because her son was growing tired from carrying it around every day.  Now they carry the cart around together, and it is much easier for them to work.  The loan will provide capital for her business, with which she will buy raw materials such as yucca, pinol sediment, cheese, cabbage, and a knife, so that she may continue to make and sell vigoron every day to her customers.  Brenda says that she is very happy to work with Fundaci\u00f3n Le\u00f3n 2000 and with the friendly organizations who are concerned with the progress of the people and of the country.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Kevin Lenhart, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":262584,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"capital de trabajo ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Leon","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.435556 -86.879444","type":"point"}},"partner_id":96,"posted_date":"2009-01-30T01:00:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":175,"lender_count":3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Brenda Lucia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-26T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-26T08:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2009-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2009-04-27T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2009-05-27T07:00:00Z","amount":750}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":43.75,"local_amount":750,"processed_date":"2009-02-26T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T08:42:01Z","rounded_local_amount":856.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20400023},{"amount":43.75,"local_amount":750,"processed_date":"2009-03-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T18:37:00Z","rounded_local_amount":856.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27092021},{"amount":43.75,"local_amount":750,"processed_date":"2009-04-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T16:40:15Z","rounded_local_amount":856.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35985404},{"amount":43.75,"local_amount":750,"processed_date":"2009-05-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T23:11:07Z","rounded_local_amount":856.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44446019}],"funded_date":"2009-01-30T02:27:32Z","paid_date":"2009-06-15T23:11:07Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kevin Lenhart","image":null}},{"id":90286,"name":"Marat","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Marat is married with a 10-year-old daughter.

Estela is very enthusiastic, happy, jovial, and, above all, hard-working.  She is a \u201cjack-of-all-trades\u201d because she sells all types of handicrafts.  \r\n\r\nShe sells door to door to her friends and acquaintances.  Her products are woven articles.  This work has allowed her to travel to take her products to the provinces.  It has been ten years since she started in this business after studying handicrafts, weavings, and other courses.  \r\n\r\nShe really likes her work because it allows her to have an income, it relaxes her, she gets to know people, and, above all, it helps her husband with the household expenses.  With her work she has obtained economic stability, she lives more peacefully, and she can meet the needs and wants of her children.  \r\n\r\nShe would really like to rent an ample location where she can sell her products.

That experience helped her stay in business and earn income for her home.\r\n\r\nMelissa sells for cash in her general store although she does give short-term credit to her best customers.  Her clientele is composed primarily of housewives that buy from her daily items needed for basic food preparation that she sells at retail in her store.  Men tend to buy the liquor, especially on weekends, and youngsters buy the miscellaneous items like accessories, school supplies, and stationery items.\r\n\r\nHer dream is to turn her store into a big supplier of smaller stores because she knows that this is much needed for it will save store owners transportation costs as well as time and space in their locales.\r\n\r\nWhile all this occurs, Melissa continues working hard to reach her goals and currently has a profit margin of no less than 17.92%, a two-day accounts receivable turnover rate and 24-day stock inventory turnovers.\r\n\r\nShe is currently applying for a Kiva loan, the first financing she\u2019s gotten from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, that she\u2019ll use to buy snacks, foodstuffs and soft-drinks to stock her store with the items that sell out most quickly and to earn discounts on her purchases for volume and for paying cash.

Paul hopes that in the future he will be able to buy a plot of land and own a bigger shop that sells phones. \r\n\r\nPaul is a member of BRAC's Small Enterprise Program (SEP).  The program primarily serves small entrepreneurs like Paul who do not have enough collateral for commercial loans, but have businesses that have grown too large for microloans.\r\n"}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":955395,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Mobile Phones","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy more phones for resale.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Iganga","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.609167 33.468611","type":"point"}},"partner_id":65,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":650,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Paul ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-12-09T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":1500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":102071},{"due_date":"2012-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":105758},{"due_date":"2012-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":109578},{"due_date":"2012-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":113536},{"due_date":"2012-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":117637},{"due_date":"2012-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":121886},{"due_date":"2012-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":126288},{"due_date":"2012-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":130849},{"due_date":"2012-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":135576},{"due_date":"2012-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":140472},{"due_date":"2012-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":145546},{"due_date":"2012-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":150803}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.23},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.48},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.2},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.98},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.82},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.72},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.7},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.75},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.87},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.07},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65.35}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jenna & Brenda Shervill","image":158900}},{"id":377991,"name":"Petrona","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Petrona de 55 a\u00f1os de edad, madre soltera por viudez, tiene   4  hijos de  28, 32, 35 y 37 a\u00f1os de  edad  y  vive en la aldea la Limonera de Santa Cruz de Yojoa.\nDo\u00f1a Petrona trabaja todo el d\u00eda atendiendo una pulper\u00eda donde vende productos de la canasta b\u00e1sica familiar, como arroz, pan, huevos, refrescos, az\u00facar, harina, churros etc.\nDesde hace tres a\u00f1os  estableci\u00f3 este negocio y ha incrementado el inventario con esfuerzos propios, con la ayuda de un hijo y con los pr\u00e9stamos que ODEF ha otorgado.

He is happy with his work, especially since it is so profitable. As long as his farmland is well-tended, he can harvest all year long. His main difficulty is in dealing with insects that affect his crops. This is Abdurasul first loan from IMON International, and he wants to purchase seeds and fertilizers for his crops.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

of low educational attainment due to low economic status, Nema M. and her husband were not able to get good-paying jobs. Therefore, they were not able to support the needs of their three children, especially the financial need to sustain their education until college. Therefore, the same thing happened to their children: they are now 22 to 26 years old and are working as laborers. Nema\u2019s eldest and youngest children are fishermen while her middle and only daughter works as a housemaid. As a mother, Nema felt sad for the lack of achievement by her children. However, despite the hard work her children do every day, they are still happy and are enjoying their lives with their parents. \r\n<p>\r\nWhen Nema joined ASHI in 2006, she and her family were very happy. With the opportunity to receive a loan, their family can have a business that everybody can work in and have earnings from. Since Nema\u2019s two sons are into fishing, Nema decide to support them financially by using the loan from ASHI to make their business grow and become profitable. Now, Nema is requesting for a much larger loan because she wants to purchase a motorboat for her sons to manage. She is the one who sells their fish to people in their village and in the market. \r\n<p>\r\nNema hope that one day their business will be profitable and sustainable enough for her only daughter to work with her in trading their fish instead of working as a housemaid, for which she receives only a very small

Among others, they are: the treasurer, Mrs. Fatma Kon\u00e9 who has been active in the sale of second-hand clothing for two years; Mrs. Khady M., a vendor of ready-to-wear clothing at the central market in Thi\u00e8s for the past two years; Mrs. Magatte M., who has been selling breakfasts and dinners in the front of her house for just one year; and finally Mrs. Fatou M. who has been managing a general grocery store for the past five years.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Alison Le Bras, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":542538,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Get supplies of various goods","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SN","country":"Senegal","town":"THIES","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"14.783333 -16.966667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":108,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":950,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Saly","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Magatte","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Khady","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-05-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":950,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2011-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2011-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2011-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":95},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":95},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":95},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":95},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Alison Le Bras","image":608879}},{"id":205868,"name":"Sonia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Sonia es soltera, vive en casa de sus padres que esta ubicada en la zona alto Obispo Bosque de la ciudad de La Paz.\nLa se\u00f1ora es empleada de supermercados Ketal y en su tiempo libre se dedica  a realizar masitas (reposter\u00eda).\nEl cr\u00e9dito solicitado es para un capital de trabajo (compra de harina, huevos, levadura, etc.) para la elaboraci\u00f3n de masas para pan y galletas y as\u00ed mejorar sus ingresos.\nEsta es la primera  ocasi\u00f3n que solicita un pr\u00e9stamo y el an\u00e1lisis socioecon\u00f3mico realizado la califica favorablemente y puede acceder  a un  cr\u00e9dito.\n","en":"Sonia is single and lives with her parents in the Obispo Bosque highland zone of the city of La Paz.

Her activity was marked by her designer's approach and personal advice to every client. \r\n\r\nIn 2009, in order to broaden her business, Aygul obtained her first loan of 20,000 KGS from Bai Tushum and Partners, which was repaid without any delays.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to epic mountain passes, a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC, and communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still lives in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.
