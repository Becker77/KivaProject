","en":"Gloria is 32 years old.  She is married and has three children who are 12, 10 and 2 years old.  She lives with her family in Latacunga, Sierra Centro, Ecuador.  Gloria describes herself as a hard-working and happy person who is loving with her children.\r\n\r\nGloria works alone selling spices for food.  She works as a street vendor.  This is the first loan she has requested from Fodemi, and it will be invested in the purchase of products like cinnamon, spices and seasonings for food.  The investment will be a great help to Gloria since it will allow her to increase her inventory and to have bigger sales and better income.  This will help to improve her quality of life and that of her loved ones.\r\n\r\nGloria's dream is to have a space to open a small store and continue to grow as a store keeper.  The streets are very dangerous but she has to work for the well-being of her children."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":903026,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to purchase products like cinnamon, spices and seasonings for food.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Latacunga","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":188,"posted_date":"2011-10-24T23:30:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":200,"lender_count":1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gloria Narcisa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-10-06T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":200,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-06T07:00:00Z","amount":31.82},{"due_date":"2011-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":32.42},{"due_date":"2012-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":33.02},{"due_date":"2012-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":33.62},{"due_date":"2012-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":34.22},{"due_date":"2012-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":34.9}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.82},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.42},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.02},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.62},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.22},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.9}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":32.5,"local_amount":32.5,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:50:04Z","rounded_local_amount":32.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244560980},{"amount":31.9,"local_amount":31.9,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:00:07Z","rounded_local_amount":31.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250771941},{"amount":36.5,"local_amount":36.5,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-16T09:13:07Z","rounded_local_amount":36.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257410309},{"amount":33.86,"local_amount":33.86,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:25:24Z","rounded_local_amount":33.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263314792},{"amount":34.99,"local_amount":34.99,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T09:20:49Z","rounded_local_amount":34.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270030986},{"amount":30.25,"local_amount":30.25,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:31:49Z","rounded_local_amount":30.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276643176}],"funded_date":"2011-10-25T01:27:39Z","paid_date":"2012-05-15T09:31:49Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Marni Siegal","image":829283}},{"id":354659,"name":"Faxruz","description":{"languages":["ru","en"],"texts":{"ru":"Faxruz ne jenat i ne imeyet detey.

Today Olga runs a successful small business selling clothing in the central city market of Melitopol. \r\n\r\nOlga is very serious and determined. Her great entrepreneurial skills and commitment to her business have helped her keep her sales high and costs low. The ability to give her customers what they want plus a little more, such as a smile or a word of encouragement, has helped Olga keep loyal customers who come back over and over again. Currently she has about $2,000 in working capital with a monthly profit of around $600. Olga is requesting a loan for 3,000 Grivnas to increase working capital.

history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

it's not a mistake! Simeona's last name is \"D. L. C.\" from her father and her mother as well! (In Spanish tradition, one's use of last names includes the mother's last name in addition to the father's last name). <p>She has lived in this place for the past 5 years. She and her husband, who is a hired laborer in the collection of cocoa beans in local plantations, have had 5 children. They couldn't keep up with the cost of such a large family, and that's the reason why Simeona chose to put up this general store in her house which is practically \"in the middle of nowhere\". The area\/community is called Serralles, and belongs to the Yamasa municipality, but it's located some 15 kilometers north of Yamasa, and it takes practically an hour to get to it. There are a lot of ravines with small brooks in this area of the country, as it rains practically on a daily basis. But that means that roads are mostly impassable so it takes a long time to get there, despite being relatively close to the neighboring town of Yamasa. \r\n<p>\r\nSimeona has a very small area and a low level of inventory to sell products. It occupies about half the length of her house. (It's not larger than what you can envision, proportioning the size of Simeona vs. the rest of the area you can see in the picture.) This can give you an idea of how poor this family is.  But she is the only one in the general area where one can get supplies of foodstuff and other items of daily usage. She sells the equivalent of around 10 dollars worth of goods a day, but now plans to keep a much larger stock and sell over 3 times as much...all possible with the requested loan. She wouldn't say her profit margin, but that's not usually expected from a 'merchant'. However, it was generally evident that she will sell for about a 200% gross margin on sales. <p>Simeona is dreaming of being able to relocate, or at least be able to rebuild their house in cement blocks, as she feels the wood is not only a fire hazard, but also subject to all kinds attacks, not only from natural phenomena, but also from termites and other bugs. She should do well with her dreams."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":62978,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"She needs to diversify, as well as bolster the stock of goods she sells, specially in the area of foods: rice, beans, cooking oil, pasta and eggs.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"DO","country":"Dominican Republic","town":"Yamasa","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"18.783333 -70.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":66,"posted_date":"2007-09-07T19:15:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Simeona","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-09-21T20:20:57Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":375,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2007-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2007-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2008-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2008-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2008-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2008-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":63,"local_amount":63,"processed_date":"2007-10-07T09:23:54Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-07T10:25:00Z","rounded_local_amount":63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":64481},{"amount":63,"local_amount":63,"processed_date":"2007-11-07T10:26:05Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-07T10:25:00Z","rounded_local_amount":63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":78012},{"amount":63,"local_amount":63,"processed_date":"2007-12-07T10:27:48Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-07T10:25:00Z","rounded_local_amount":63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":93228},{"amount":63,"local_amount":63,"processed_date":"2008-01-07T10:15:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-07T10:25:00Z","rounded_local_amount":63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":111262},{"amount":63,"local_amount":63,"processed_date":"2008-02-07T10:15:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-07T10:25:00Z","rounded_local_amount":63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":130520},{"amount":60,"local_amount":60,"processed_date":"2008-03-07T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-07T10:25:00Z","rounded_local_amount":60,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":152208}],"funded_date":"2007-09-07T20:20:57Z","paid_date":"2008-03-07T10:07:09Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":21913,"name":"Joyce","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Joyce is 40 yeas old and married with four children.

Husnidinkhon has been in the photography business for three years. He is married and has two children. He has a secondary technical education and was trained as an engineer. Since the local factories are closed, Husnidinkhon started a photography business in order to support his family. Now he has many clients, but in order to stay abreast of the competition, he needs to keep his photo equipment up to date. Husnidinkhon wants a loan to buy new equipment, which will improve the quality of the photo services he provides.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\nIMON's History\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She lives with her husband and children in her own home. For twenty years she has worked in agriculture with her husband and children. They mainly grow potatoes, but when it is harvest season they sell dried corn that they take to the capital city of their country. For a greater selection of product, they hire the services of several women who work hard in the fields every day. The products that she sells are in demand. Esther would like to continue this activity that allows her to provide for her family.

She is 38 years old. She is separated from her spouse and has 4 school-aged children. To make a living, Analie owns & operates a business venture in the retail sector running a sari-sari (variety) retail shop. The primary source of income for the business comes from selling food & daily use products in the local community. Analie has been engaged in her business for over 5 years and earns approximately 8,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Analie joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 4,000 PHP from HSPFI, and is requesting a new loan of 7,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This will be the 2nd loan taken out by Analie from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement her family\u2019s income. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is an accredited partner of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, we created this template for our field staff to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate

She is 49 years old and over the course of her life she has managed to raise a beautiful family of four children -  three who work and the youngest who is studying medicine. Her husband left home, but this has not been the reason to keep motivated since she has the support of her children economically and morally. She used to work in upholstery, but then she resigned and started to buy new clothes for women. She is also an Avon representative and sells a variety of products such as creams, perfumes, makeup, beauty products, facials and other things. She sells for cash and two-week credit. Her goal is to be able to buy a display cabinet so that she can display her products and keep winning customers.

Fue por eso que comenz\u00f3 a vender ropa usada para poder sacar dinero para los pa\u00f1ales de su hijo. Poco a poco fue d\u00e1ndose cuenta de que teniendo un negocio extra era muy bueno para poder solventar a su familia. Poco a poco fue incrementando en sus productos, cambiando la ropa usada por ropa nueva. <p>\r\nSin embargo actualmente no cuenta con ropa de invierno para poder ofrecerles a sus clientes. Es por eso que Claudia est\u00e1 solicitando un cr\u00e9dito de US $250 que est\u00e1 dispuesta a pagarlos en un plazo de 5 meses y as\u00ed con este dinero podr\u00e1 comprar m\u00e1s mercanc\u00eda en Morole\u00f3n, Guanajuato, para as\u00ed tener nuevos productos qu\u00e9 ofrecer a sus clientes.

Bone Village is situated about one and a half hours drive from Kupang City. Most of community living in Bone Village have a background as farmers who depend on agricultural products to support their family life. A  small number in the community depend on husbandry in meeting their family needs as it requires a large amount of capital.\r\n\r\nThis group is part of a larger group of 15 cattle farmers. Due to the recent devaluation of the Indonesian Rupiah, the group had to be split into 2 smaller groups to keep the loan size within the limit of $5,000 per group loan. Due to the remote location of the village, the partner was not able to re-visit the group for new pictures. The original photo has been split in half.\r\n\r\nThe community in Bone village usually consumes corn and cassava as their main food. They sell agricultural products such as bananas and coconuts at the market in the town of Inpres, which is situated about 37 km from Bone Village. The challenge for the community in this village is the availability of public transport to help them reach the market. The public transport only operates on Monday, Wednesday and Saturday and there is no local market available in this village so it is quite difficult for the community to sell their agricultural products.\r\n\r\nKuanputun A is led by a 34 year old farmer \u2013 Simson N.. Simson was born and grew up in Bone Village. He is a married man with 3 children; Dian N., 6 years old is in the first grade of Elementary School, Andhika N. is 3 years old and Alfian N. is 1 year old.\r\n\r\nAs a farmer, Simson spends his days cultivating the farm. He plants peanuts, cassavas, vegetables, coconuts and bananas. His family has always relied on the agricultural products to meet their daily needs. Simson\u2019s wife also helps by selling their agricultural products but they generate only a small income, so Simson has difficulty to finance the children\u2019s education fees and their daily needs.\r\n\r\nSimson also faces the same difficulty as the rest of the community, the difficulty of selling their agricultural products inspite of the transportation problem. This difficulty has driven Simson to find another way to support his family life. \r\n\r\nSimson has chosen The Cattle Fattening program to increase his income to support his family life. Simson and his neighbors were really excited when they heard about the TLM cattle fattening program. Simson and his neighbors decided to form a group to receive a loan so they could buy a number of young cattle to be fattened. They are really interested in joining this program because the selling price of cattle is quite high in the market. They are sure that the profits that will be generated from this program will help them meet the familiies daily needs. They hope the loan will help them to improve their living standard and provide a bright future for their children.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2375,"image":{"id":357297,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy cattle to be fattened","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Bone","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":129,"posted_date":"2009-07-24T02:49:24Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2375,"lender_count":84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Simson","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yohanis","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Koenelius","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yosafat","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Martinus","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Agustinus","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ories","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":false}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-07-03T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"IDR","disbursal_amount":23800000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":2375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":23800000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2375}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":2375,"local_amount":23800000,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-26T08:02:53Z","rounded_local_amount":23881549.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":124001208}],"funded_date":"2009-07-26T23:53:35Z","paid_date":"2010-03-26T08:02:53Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Dave Gibbons","image":608904}},{"id":128453,"name":"Sokhea","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Sokhea Y., 45, and her husband, Mr. On Ork, 47, live along National Road Number five about 17 kilometers from Phnom Penh City.

They live in Batey Santa Lucia, a small community north of San Pedro. Bateyes are small rural communities built by sugar companies for their field workers. Bateyes are typically very hard to reach, have no potable water, and little to no electricity. Santa Lucia is a particularly small and isolated batey, but despite the difficulties, Maria makes the most out of her opportunities by selling clothing to her neighbors. Since the community is small and people need new clothing only so often, Maria will also use this loan to purchase food to cook meals for her friends and neighbors.\r\n\r\nIn sugarcane-based communities, during six months of the year there is little work to be done. This time is called \u201cTiempo Muerto\u201d, or dead time. Maria says that it is during this time that she especially needs her business. Once \u201cLa Safra\u201d (the harvest) starts, her family is not as desperate for income. She has smartly balanced her business around the growing season, taking out more money during Tiempo Muerto than during La Safra. With her smart business planning, Maria hopes to continue making profit to support her family and hopefully send her children to college.

She owns a business venture, raising pigs for sale.  Makerita  has many years of experience in this business.  Makerita  needs a loan of WST $1000 to invest in expanding the business.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 600 talas or US $250 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Makerita  joined SPBD.    This is her 1st loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Makerita 's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Makerita  P. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.87 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                         2 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:            2 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:                2 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress.  The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation.  A higher number represents a higher score.  For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.  \r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.  \r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

The only more or less practical decision for ordinary people is to try to open their own business and start sales.  Sonunbubu O. is the leader of this group.  Together with her family, she lives in the town of Karabalta.  Sonunbubu is fifty-five years old.  Her husband is retired and has not worked for a long time.  Together, they raised three children.  They already married off two daughters, and the son lives with his grandmother and takes care of her.  Sonunbubu realized her situation just in time and started her own business ten years ago.  She used some of her savings to buy a sewing machine and began offering sewing services for local citizens.  She also started sewing bedding for sale.  Her business went uphill.  Using the profits from this business, Sonunbubu was able to buy a cow and household appliances for home.  Her current net profit is around three thousand som ($70).  Sonunbubu got a second wind with this business.  She strives to continue the business that she started, but needs some help with this now.  She needs a loan to purchase supplies and materials in order to fulfill orders for bedding.  Sonunbubu plans to buy a new sewing machine in the future and also wants to install new gates for her house.\r\n\r\nSonunbubu has three partners in this group:\r\n\r\nBagdagul D. is forty-three years old.  She has three children.  In order to support their family, Bagdagul and her husband offer European remodeling services.  Their oldest son left to go work in Russia.  Bagdagul learned how to make plaster while still in college, and this skills proved to be useful later.  She needs a loan to buy building materials for work.\r\n\r\nSadiya I. is fifty-two years old.  Her husband works as a driver at the military base.  Sadiya is involved in breeding and selling sheep.  She and her husband raised five children together.  The oldest son and daughter already have their own families.  One of the daughters works in Bishkek, and a son works in Russia.  The youngest son goes to school.  Sadiya needs a loan to buy sheep for breeding.\r\n\r\nGuljan J. is forty-six years old.  Her husband is involved in domestic work.  Guljan has five children.  Two daughters already attend a university, and the rest go to school.  Guljan sells grocery products.  She requested a loan in order to purchase goods for business expansion.

N. was born in Changalane, a town about 38km from Namaacha, Maputo Province, Mozambique. She is 41 years old and has 3 children with ages between 6 and 19, all of them students. She lives with her own house with her family and also helps her mother by sending her U$90 every month. \r\nMarta owns a grocery store. In previous days she owned a tractor and worked in the farms where she was able to save some money to start her own business; later on there was some family dispute over her late father-in-law's properties, and she ended up declaring bankrupcy. She heard of Kiva from a cousin and she's asking for a U$600 loan, which she will use to improve her business. \r\nShe travels once a month to get more products for her store, and her best selling products are sugar, rice and beverages. She makes about U$175 per month and she's been able to save U$40 every month. She counts with the help of her husband who own 32 cows. \r\nThis is Marta's third loan and she's using it to buy more merchandise like sugar, rice, flour, beverages and others, so she can sell more and have more profit. She's confident she will be able to pay the loan back before the deadline, and ask for a new loan to expand even more her business.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Mariana Dauwe, Kiva

His greatest dream is to provide his family with the quality of life they deserve.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Katie Kavanagh, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":561013,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Metal Shop","sector":"Manufacturing","themes":null,"use":"To buy aluminum and glass to expand his door and counter-making business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Cayalt\u00ed - Chiclayo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":143,"posted_date":"2010-06-27T07:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":725,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Victor Manuel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-05-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":133.6},{"due_date":"2010-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":148.47},{"due_date":"2010-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":147.35},{"due_date":"2010-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":150.56},{"due_date":"2010-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":160.37},{"due_date":"2010-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":162.64},{"due_date":"2010-12-27T08:00:00Z","amount":168.06},{"due_date":"2011-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":174.67},{"due_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":177.86},{"due_date":"2011-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":187.29},{"due_date":"2011-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":192.52},{"due_date":"2011-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":196.61}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.43},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.82},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.41},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.58},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.14},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.95},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.93},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.31},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.48},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.89},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.79},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.27}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":48.43,"local_amount":133.6,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:38:36Z","rounded_local_amount":136.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151878397},{"amount":53.82,"local_amount":148.47,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T10:50:40Z","rounded_local_amount":152.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159618437},{"amount":53.41,"local_amount":147.35,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:02:09Z","rounded_local_amount":151,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166832832},{"amount":54.58,"local_amount":150.56,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T09:57:02Z","rounded_local_amount":154.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172099434},{"amount":178.01,"local_amount":491.07,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T13:45:37Z","rounded_local_amount":503.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182530227},{"amount":63.32,"local_amount":174.67,"processed_date":"2011-01-26T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T02:54:03Z","rounded_local_amount":179.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191409684},{"amount":64.48,"local_amount":177.86,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T08:33:13Z","rounded_local_amount":182.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":196108127},{"amount":208.95,"local_amount":576.42,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T10:50:36Z","rounded_local_amount":590.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201270260}],"funded_date":"2010-06-27T14:03:51Z","paid_date":"2011-04-15T10:50:36Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Katie Kavanagh","image":847206}},{"id":215345,"name":"Sreymom","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Sreymom C.

fruit. She lives in Aborlan, Palawan. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2008 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her business, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of $250. \r\n\r\nNora is borrowing 10,000 PHP so that she can purchase a stock of fruits to sell. This will be her 6th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of 7,000 PHP, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Nora aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams.

He has been in his business for the last three years. This business is profitable for him but his major challenge is the fact that fruits are seasonal.

In the future, Krishna Maya plans to lift the economic condition of her family. She thanks you for your support. \r\n<p>\r\nIn the Kathmandu Valley, a small grocery store called a pasal is an important part of the local economy. Fresh produce, milk, and staples such as rice, lentils, and flour are purchased daily for cooking in the home. Owners of small grocery stores use Kiva loans to increase their purchasing power and profit margains. By keeping inventory strong and purchasing in larger amounts, owners of these small stores are able to increase profitability. While a typical pasal might be no more than 100 square feet, they are always full of bargaining customers, incoming produce, and shrewd businesswomen. \r\n<p>\r\nThis loan was administered by Kiva's local partner MFI, Patan Business and Professional Women. Patan BPW became Kiva's first field partner in Nepal in 2007. Patan BPW operates throughout the Kathmandu Valley, offering microcredit and business training programs to low-income women. In addition to providing economic opportunity to their clients, Patan BPW seeks to empower Nepali women within the home and community.

He lives in his own house located in Nueva Alianza community, in Pichari. He is a farmer, who learned from his parents at a very young age. They taught him how to fertilize and care for the land. However, at his current age, he can not put forth the same physical effort as before and for that reason he opted to start a business and sell groceries: thus he could continue to make a profit without jeopardizing his health. His decision to start a business of this kind is because the few existing stores are too far from his township and in this way he can make it easier for his neighbors to meet their needs.\r\n\r\nEven so, Toribio wants to continue working simultaneously as a farmer. Consequently he wants to expand his planting of cacao, because it is a product that is in higher demand and generates strong returns. He enjoys the work because he feels attracted to nature.\r\n\r\nThis will be his first loan with MFP and he is committed to making his payments on time. With the 3,000 soles he is requesting he will contract laborers to help him trim and weed between his cacao plants. \r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":886008,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to contract laborers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"CUSCO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.518333 -71.978056","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-10-01T05:00:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1100,"lender_count":32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Toribio ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-09-02T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":206.63},{"due_date":"2011-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":210.54},{"due_date":"2011-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":221.23},{"due_date":"2012-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":226.17},{"due_date":"2012-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":234.35},{"due_date":"2012-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":247.35},{"due_date":"2012-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":251.78},{"due_date":"2012-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":262.56},{"due_date":"2012-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":270.4},{"due_date":"2012-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":281.22},{"due_date":"2012-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":290.36},{"due_date":"2012-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":297.41}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75.76},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":77.2},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81.12},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":82.93},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.93},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.69},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92.32},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.27},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":99.15},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":103.11},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.47},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":109.05}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":77.27,"local_amount":210.74,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:58:14Z","rounded_local_amount":213.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238666622},{"amount":75.69,"local_amount":206.43,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:42:58Z","rounded_local_amount":209.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244621771},{"amount":81.24,"local_amount":221.56,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:51:15Z","rounded_local_amount":224.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250835852},{"amount":172.47,"local_amount":470.37,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:19:58Z","rounded_local_amount":477.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257245609},{"amount":86.96,"local_amount":237.17,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:28:26Z","rounded_local_amount":240.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270098719},{"amount":92.32,"local_amount":251.78,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T10:29:16Z","rounded_local_amount":255.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276712908},{"amount":96.27,"local_amount":262.56,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:28:10Z","rounded_local_amount":266.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283202013},{"amount":99.15,"local_amount":270.4,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-16T08:34:31Z","rounded_local_amount":274.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287097800},{"amount":212.64,"local_amount":579.92,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:11:29Z","rounded_local_amount":588.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294400683},{"amount":105.99,"local_amount":289.07,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:31:59Z","rounded_local_amount":293.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308451159}],"funded_date":"2011-10-26T13:17:30Z","paid_date":"2012-10-16T09:31:59Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Diane Chaney","image":825872}},{"id":346502,"name":"Maria","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Maria is 37 years old and lives in the Philippines.

She is a young woman who has a desire to get ahead in life and do well for her future.  She lives with her partner by whom she has a three-year-old son.  They live together in their own home and, together with her partner, Ida works hard to provide their son with a better quality of life.  Ida's business is selling food in the evenings.  She goes out to sell her products on the sidewalk outside her house.  She had been selling her food continually for seven years but stopped approximately one year ago owing to some problems.  However, six months ago she started selling her food again and her business is up and running again.  As her food is tasty, her customers are always seeking her out so that they can eat her delicious dishes.  She works alone and would like to make progress, doing her good work.\r\n\r\nWhat Ida likes about her work is that it gives her time to be with her young son and she also has time to take care of her household.  Her business is doing well as her customers are very loyal.  This is because she provides good customer service and delicious food.  She hopes to continue selling her food for a long time to come and, in the future, she would like to improve the infrastructure of her business.  \r\n\r\nThis will be Ida's second loan from MFP.  Her first loan went very well and she hopes to be able to continue doing well.

She is a widow and a mother to her four children. She, together with her children, manages her house while operating her business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses. <p>\r\n\r\nJosefina operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to people in the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one packet of shampoo, some cooking oil, or an egg. She earns income by purchasing supplies at wholesale prices and selling them at retail prices. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and others in her local community. She earns a minimum of 500 PHP in sales every day. <p>\r\n\r\nTo help her continue business operations, she is requesting a loan in the amount of 25,000 PHP. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, beverages and other products to add to her inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. Josefina hopes to be able to expand her business soon, just as she dreams to be able to provide her family with a good future through all her hard work. She faithfully meets with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and to draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":937485,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

Para Augusto no hay  impedimento para seguir surgiendo y obteniendo buenos provechos; desde muy ni\u00f1o sus padres le inculcaron a trabajar en la chacra y es conocedor del arduo trabajo en el campo. Augusto es campesino donde sus terrenos son cultivados con plantas de caf\u00e9. Ya tiene 15 a\u00f1os trabajando en sus propias tierras, y en tiempos de cosecha cuenta  con el apoyo de su esposa, sus 02 hijos y de los jornaleros para as\u00ed avanzar con mayor rapidez en cuanto a la cosecha.

He has two children Wilian, 15 and Deysi, 13.  They live together in their own home within the Camunachari community. \r\n\r\nThere is no stopping Augusto from continuing to grow and obtain good profits; since he was a small child his parents took him to work on the farm and he is well accustomed to hard work in the fields. Augusto is a farmer and grows coffee in his fields.  He has already spent 15 years working his own land. During the harvest seasons his wife and two children as well as casual labourers help him out so that they can harvest the coffee more quickly.  \r\n\r\nWhat he most enjoys about his work is harvesting the fruits of his labour as this makes him feel that the months of hard work have paid off.  The hardest thing for him is transporting his produce from his farm to the city of San Francisco, where he gets the best prices for his products.  He says that he is not fond of the winter because of the amount of insects and rainfall that hamper the yield from his plantation and threaten his crops.\r\n\r\nHe has requested a loan so that he is able to buy more coffee seeds to graft so as to get a good return on his work in less time.  This will be his first loan from MFP and he feels that the money will help him a great deal in his work. He is cooperative with everyone at his communal bank.  With the 1,000 new soles he will buy more coffee seeds to graft so as to get a good return on his work in less time.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":977799,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy coffee seeds","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"CUSCO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.518333 -71.978056","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-01-12T18:10:14Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Augusto ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-12-20T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":109.6},{"due_date":"2012-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":113.6},{"due_date":"2012-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":119.61},{"due_date":"2012-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":122.12},{"due_date":"2012-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":126.57},{"due_date":"2012-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":131.68},{"due_date":"2012-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":136.33},{"due_date":"2012-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":140.49}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.1},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.6},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.85},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.8},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.46},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.38},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.13},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.68}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":41.1,"local_amount":109.6,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:18:52Z","rounded_local_amount":110.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257246246},{"amount":42.6,"local_amount":113.6,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:30:21Z","rounded_local_amount":114.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263386257},{"amount":44.85,"local_amount":119.61,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:29:49Z","rounded_local_amount":120.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270099349},{"amount":45.8,"local_amount":122.12,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-21T08:25:53Z","rounded_local_amount":123.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276713495},{"amount":47.46,"local_amount":126.57,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:29:25Z","rounded_local_amount":127.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283202387},{"amount":49.38,"local_amount":131.68,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-16T08:34:57Z","rounded_local_amount":132.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287098068},{"amount":51.13,"local_amount":136.33,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:11:56Z","rounded_local_amount":137.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294400927},{"amount":52.68,"local_amount":140.49,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:55:30Z","rounded_local_amount":141.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301455443}],"funded_date":"2012-01-13T05:50:28Z","paid_date":"2012-09-15T10:55:30Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Rachael Walker","image":null}},{"id":851334,"name":"Zoya","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Zoya and Katerina came to the States a few years ago.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to epic mountain passes, a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC, and communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language. Today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to offer poor and low-income clients a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He lives with his parents Dionisio and Justina, whom he takes care of and supports in having their own home.  Their home is located in the hamlet of Bellavista Huaracayo. \r\n\r\nHis main economic support is growing large quantities of peas and potatoes.  He has been doing this for 10 years, and what he likes most about his work is sowing the seeds in the earth.  With all this time of tireless working, he has been able to buy his own farmland which is very well located. It is within reach of the river, which means that Jes\u00fas can irrigate consistently.  As his crops are maturing faster, he occasionally hires workers to help him in the maintenance and harvest of his crops.\r\n\r\nThe biggest problem that he faces is a lack of working capital, as a year ago his harvest failed, which was a bad time.  But this doesn't discourage him, as he has started working selling large quantities of chopped potatoes in the country's capital, where he travels every two weeks.  He is now planning on saving money, so as to be able to increase his crops so that he can sell them in the country's capital.\r\n\r\nHe belongs to the communal bank \"Se\u00f1or de Muruhuay\u201d, and he feels grateful to them for the opportunity they are giving him.

She is a resident of GMA, Cavite, Philippines. Her husband is a farmer. Together with her husband and children, Wilma manages their household while operating her accessories stall. She is working hard to provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n  \r\nWilma buys accessory items from a wholesaler and sells them at a profit. Her products include hair clips, head bands, and bags. Customers are attracted to buy due to Wilma's low prices and the many options she offered. Her regular customers are students and mall patrons.  She earns 500 PHP in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, Wilma is requesting a loan for 48,000 PHP, which she will use to buy more quantities and varieties of accessory products to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nWilma dreams of expanding her store and helping her children through all her hard work in her business. She meets with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week. \r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study God, build social capital, and pay microfinance

The group is currently on their third cycle of Fundacion Paraguaya's Entrepreneurial Women program; each woman currently receives an average of 943,000 guaran\u00eds (US$231). \r\n<p>\r\nThe first committee meetings were held in the home of Mrs. Marilyn C.. 22 interested women showed up to the group's first meeting. Then, in the second group meeting, 18 women agreed to sign up and take on the benefits and the responsibilities inherent in the program. Today, they hold weekly meetings whenever possible. It is difficult to find a regular time when they are all free to meet, since most of them are ambulatory vendors and work very long hours, beginning very early in the morning and finishing very late at night. \r\n<p>\r\nThough this committee is one of the newest formed at the Caacup\u00e9 office, the women are already doing all sorts of extra work in order to make contributions to their group savings account. This account is very important, and will be used if any of the committee members has to pay for emergency hospitalizations or medications, or to help women make their repayments so that they do not fall behind. \r\n<p>\r\nEach woman will invest her share of the loan to purchase merchandise or raw materials for the particular products she sells.\r\n<p>\r\nTranslated by Cynthia McMurry, Kiva volunteer.\r\n<p>\r\nEl comit\u00e9 est\u00e1 integrado por 18 se\u00f1oras trabajadoras del barrio Santa Lucia de la ciudad de Caacup\u00e9, la mayor\u00eda de ellas poseen despensas, otras kioscos, ventas de ropa y ventas de chipa (comida t\u00edpica del Paraguay).El grupo se encuentra actualmente en el 3er.

She looked at her economic situation, being the mother of two children, and began to worry more because they are in high school. Therefore, she looked for a way to start an extra business to help her husband. She looked into the market with some friends and acquired a spot there.

They are blessed with three children only one of whom is under 15 years of age. As a hard-working young man, he has faced some major challenges in life such as the death of his mother, poor health, dropping out of school and inadequate funds to continue his business. Because of all these challenges, Andrea later found GHAPE as a source of relief in 2005. In that same year, he received his fist loan of 20,000FRS, then 45,000FRS in the year 2006, and 100,000FRS in the 2008. With all these loans, his repayments were done promptly.\r\n\r\nWith the new loan, he plans to buy piglets for 100,000FRS, one month old chicks for 100,000FRS, and he will use his personal contribution of 50,000FRS to buy seedlings for gardening. Andrea will start repayment at the fourth month from the day of loan disbursement. He plans to use the profit from the loan to educate his children, expand on his business, and buy for the children\u2019s needs. The business of Andrea will help his community by providing organic manure to them for crop cultivation and provide vegetables to the community. He is convinced the business will succeed because of the experience he has as far as the business is concerned, and he has a ready market to supply his product. \r\n\r\nAndrea prefers to take a loan from GHAPE because the method of repayment is good and comfortable for him, and proper follow-up is being done to ensure the loan is properly managed. \r\n\r\n---\r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon.  GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach.  Every client is trained in business management, basic health, life skills, financial management, profits and losses, and family values.  Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement.  GHAPE instills a sense of family and community within its clients and staff and has developed a strong bond of trust between the organization and its clients.

Gulom has been a livestock farmer. He breeds calves, cows and sheep. He is married and has three children whom he needs to support and give a proper education.\r\n\r\nGulom has improved his financial situation because his father is also a cattle breeder and, from childhood, Gulom has gained a rich experience in the livestock business.\r\n\r\nNowadays, his biggest dream is to expand his business and to also offer animal derivates (such as dairy products) in the surroundings of his community. Therefore, his biggest need is to get a loan in order to buy more cows. Gulom is very grateful to everyone who is helping him to improve his living.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>More about Tajikistan and IMON International<\/b>\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She owns a business venture, planting & harvesting taro for sale.  Lagi has many years of experience in this business.  Lagi needs a loan of WST $1750 to rent land to raise additional crops.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 500 talas or US $208 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nYou can view pictures of a typical plantation in Samoa, taken by a Kiva Fellow, at:http:\/\/picasaweb.google.com\/agnes.p.chu\/SamoanPlantation\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Lagi joined SPBD.    This is her 4th loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Lagi's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Lagi A. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                         1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:            1.5 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:                2.2 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

In his  land  he  also  has other  crops  like  bananas and corn  but his  main sustenance comes  from rice. He has  four grown  up children that help him with the  land. He  and  his  wife live  by  themselves  on their  house,  made out of  wood  an cement. He  is  requesting a loan  for agricultural  purposes but also  to remodel his  house that needs some  fixing.\r\n<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Communal Banking in Baba<\/h4> \r\n<p>This borrower is part of the newest Communal Bank in the recently developed Mifex Rural Finance Program. All of the members of the Rosa de Oro (Golden Rose) Communal Bank are part of an Association of Rice Farmers in the county of Baba in rural Ecuador. Their association works cooperatively to cultivate rice and commercialize the product after it has grown. As an association, Rosa de Oro helps the farmers by providing access to machinery, training services and government assistance. The farmers from Rosa de Oro are very close to each other and cooperate to help one another on their farms.  \r\n<\/p> \r\n<p>The members of Rosa de Oro will use the micro-loans to prepare their lands and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each others' guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the Rosa de Oro Association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many micro-finance programs, but Mifex believes that is imperative for the communities we works with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties. <\/p> \r\n<p><em>Below is more information about Baba compiled by Luis Crespo and Robert Edgar of the Mifex team when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. <\/em><\/p> \r\n<h4>Economy of Baba<\/h4> \r\n<p>The people of Baba have been organized since the days of Gran Colombia when Ecuador was yet to be a country. The area has always been popular because of the extremely productive lands that gave way to cultivation of cacao for decades. Now Baba is a county in the province of Los Rios in the coastal region of Ecuador. For most of the latter part of the 20th Century it was a cacao and banana producing sector. Most of the surrounding areas of Baba in Los Rios are owned by large mulitnational  \r\ncompanies such as Dole, but Baba is a sector characterized by the small and informal farms. <\/p>\r\n<p>Rice production has now turned into the main economic activity of the sector as about 80% of the people are rice farmers. Cacao is still very popular in the area, but because of the long cultivation cycle people prefer to invest in rice. The lands in Baba are very fertile though, and most farmers in the sector often grow other crops, such as plantains and soy beans  \r\nas secondary sources of income.  Many farmers also keep livestock as emergency sources of food and income, commonly resorting to selling a chicken or pig if they are in need of cash. <\/p> \r\n<h4>Rice Farming in Baba<\/h4> \r\n<p>Most of the people in the Baba area are small farmers. They produce about 80 sacks of rice per hectare of land. In order to farm they first must prepare the lands by removing weeds, plowing and leveling the lands. This is the most difficult part for the farmers in Baba, who often lack the necessary machinery to properly plow the lands for rice production. After appropriately preparing the lands, the farmers fill an area with water to form what is known as a paddy field, because rice is a very water intensive crop. The rice seeds are either dispersed freely (the process is known as boleo in Spanish) or hand sowed. Once the rice has grown, most farmers rent machinery that helps them gather their production. <\/p> \r\n<h4>Access to Credit<\/h4> \r\n<p>One of the biggest struggles in the area has been the lack of credit due to the absence of any type of financial institution. \r\nBecause people do not count on formal financial finance, they have turned to loan sharks for financing. They have been affected by expensive lines of credit that exceed 100% interest a year and can be as expensive as 240%. Intermediaries also exploit the farmers because of their outstanding debt. Farmers also lack skills and knowledge to commercialize their products and pay fair prices for their crops. <\/p> \r\n<h4>Risks<\/h4> \r\n<p>The largest risk in the sector is due to absence of watering systems. Although Baba is in the province \u201cLos Rios\u201d (the rivers) there is severe problem with access to water. The lack of infrastructure in the sector does not allow the small farmers to benefit from the presence of the many rivers in the area. If the winter season is too dry, it is likely that the lands will not be sufficiently fertile for rice production in the summer. On the other hand, if there is too much rain there are not any drainage systems to prevent flooding and the crops are often ruined. Generally speaking though, Baba is a very productive sector where the lands yield all types of crops including rice, cacao, corn, watermelons, plantains, and soy beans. <\/p> \r\n<h4>Loan Use<\/h4> \r\n<p>The loans in this sector will mostly be used to to buy soil, seeds, fertilizer and insecticides. Many clients will use the capital towards renting machinery and equipment necessary to effectively work and prepare the fields. Clients also typically use a part of the loan to buy livestock in order to raise and have as reserves. The loan repayment schedule is different from the typical micro-entrepreneur because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures. Mifex asks our rural clients only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 6 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the seventh and final month. <\/p>\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":33478,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Sembrar Arroz","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Baba","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-1.783333 -79.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":7,"posted_date":"2007-05-01T19:32:17Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Emilio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-05-16T19:48:10Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":550,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2007-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2007-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2007-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":91.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2007-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":91.65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":92,"local_amount":92,"processed_date":"2007-06-17T09:15:12Z","settlement_date":"2007-11-17T20:40:55Z","rounded_local_amount":92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":23731},{"amount":92,"local_amount":92,"processed_date":"2007-07-17T09:15:22Z","settlement_date":"2007-11-17T20:40:55Z","rounded_local_amount":92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":32856},{"amount":92,"local_amount":92,"processed_date":"2007-08-17T09:15:30Z","settlement_date":"2007-11-17T20:40:55Z","rounded_local_amount":92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":43530},{"amount":92,"local_amount":92,"processed_date":"2007-09-17T09:15:24Z","settlement_date":"2007-11-17T20:40:55Z","rounded_local_amount":92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":55496},{"amount":92,"local_amount":92,"processed_date":"2007-10-17T09:15:16Z","settlement_date":"2007-11-17T20:40:55Z","rounded_local_amount":92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":68341},{"amount":90,"local_amount":90,"processed_date":"2007-11-17T10:15:19Z","settlement_date":"2007-11-17T20:40:55Z","rounded_local_amount":90,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":82459}],"funded_date":"2007-05-02T19:48:10Z","paid_date":"2007-11-17T10:15:19Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":13785,"name":"Oung","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mr. Oung H. is 58 years old and lives in Kampong Chnang with his wife and their 5 children.

She began with a small amount of items that she purchased in the supermarket and little by little went increasing her offerings.

Maria constantly fights to ensure her business continues.<p>\r\n\r\nNonetheless she currently has little merchandise and is therefore requesting a loan of US$925 to be paid within 6 months.
