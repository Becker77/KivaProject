He lives in his own house with his wife Nery, who is 31, and their four dear children, to whom he would like to offer a better quality of life. The activity in which Paulino makes a living is in coffee crops, as he has three hectares of land where he plants his products. He has become one of the main producers in the area due to his technologized method of cropping. His most profitable products are pineapple and cocoa, as there is a greater demand for these in the national market. \r\n\r\nWhat he likes the most about his job is harvesting his crops and he does this diligently. He has worked for the last 15 years in this activity and he believes that the most difficult part is transporting his products from his ranch to the outlets in the city of San Francisco. \r\n\r\nAt the moment his priority is to care for his crops by weeding, fumigating and fertilizing, for which he needs to hire labourers. This will be his first loan with MFP. He is committed to paying his quotas punctually as he has done in other loans. In his communal bank he participates and is punctual to all of his arranged meetings. With the 1,500 PEN he will buy manure and fertilizers to care for his crops."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":984352,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy fertilizers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"CUSCO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.518333 -71.978056","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-01-20T07:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":575,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Paulino ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-12-29T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":575}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":575,"local_amount":1500,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:55:35Z","rounded_local_amount":1548.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301455488}],"funded_date":"2012-01-21T15:52:00Z","paid_date":"2012-09-15T10:55:35Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Laura Darby","image":null}},{"id":414684,"name":"Juanitah","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Juanitah is 30 years old and married with 3 children.

from Dar es Salaam, Tanzania! This is 43-year-old Rhoda K.. She is married with four children, who are between the ages of 12 and 24 years old. In 2007, Rhoda established a clothing business. Rhoda has already received and successfully repaid two loans from SELFINA, and now seeks another loan in order to purchase additional stocks of clothing in bulk. She thanks you for your support.\r\n<p>\r\nRhoda is a perfect example of why micro-finance works and why the vast majority of people in her position repay their loans. A lot of people who hear about micro-finance (or kiva.org) for the first time wonder \u201chow do you make sure people pay back their loans?\" and \"won't the borrowers just take the money?\u201d Such questions wrongfully imply that the individuals who access micro-credit (usually the \"poor\") are less trustworthy, efficient, or educated than other people. Regardless, most MFIs have due diligence procedures in place to assess client risk, as well as measures (e.g., collateral arrangements and group lending, where a  loan in default is borne by the group as a whole) to address this risk. More importantly, there is an incentive that is built into each and every micro-loan: the borrowers are incentivized to repay their loans so that they can receive additional loans as their businesses continue to grow. \r\n<p>\r\nAbout SELFINA:\r\nSELFINA is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through sale and leaseback arrangements. Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets; therefore, they are not considered to be credit-worthy by financial institutions because they lack tangible assets that can serve as collateral. Accordingly, most women in Tanzania receive poor financial support and, as such, have very little income to provide for their basic needs and services. SELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through micro-leasing as a practical way to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women. In practice, SELFINA buys and leases equipment to women; specifically, in a SELFINA sale and leaseback transaction, when a client needs working capital, SELFINA buys equipment from that client (to provide the client with cash flow) and then leases the equipment back to her so that she can continue to use the equipment."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":875,"image":{"id":129399,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing

Since they married, she is in charge of preparing meals for those who work on the farm. \r\n\r\nShe gets up at 6.00am to make breakfast, then feeds the animals that she raises, including guinea pigs and rabbits. She has recently bought three little pigs, and has to be very attentive to their feeding. At 8.00am she makes the lunch meal to take out to her husband, who is preparing the fields for sowing peas. Once she has delivered the meal she returns home with grass for the guinea pigs and rabbits. During the harvest season she stays out in the fields to pick the peas and supervise the labourers. Her husband undertakes the hard and heavy work such as filling the sacks with the harvest. \r\n\r\nDelfina has worked with MFP on four consecutive loans and has always made her repayments on the designated dates.

She is originally from Haiti, but moved to the Dominican Republic with her husband in search of a better life. The Dominican Republic boasts a much higher standard of living and per capita GDP (gross domestic product) than Haiti. Even so, there is a great deal of racism toward Haitians, who tend to find themselves working at menial jobs if they are lucky enough to find work at all. Junie has been struggling to adapt to the new culture and language in Puerta Plata.\r\n\r\nJunie and her husband live with their children, Ricardo and John Pierre, who are 8 and 5 years old. The children attend a local school where they study hard to make good grades. Junie ultimately hopes to enroll her children into a university, but her income is not currently sufficient to harbor such a dream. She makes 2,000 DRP a month (about 57 USD), but thinks she will be able to significantly increase her earnings through Esperanza.\r\n\r\nJunie plans to use her loan to start a small restaurant in her home. She says that she will cook rice, beans, chicken, and beef, which are some of the staples of the Dominican diet. She will buy the raw materials from a local food vendor in her neighborhood. Ultimately, Junie would like to open a fully-fledged restaurant in a busier section of Puerta Plata. That goal is a long way off, but the determination in Junie\u2019s eyes suggests it is a definite possibility. Your contribution will help Junie make the first step to turn her aspirations into reality.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":353726,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Restaurant","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To

21 mujeres que residen en el pueblo de Rocafuerte, aproximadamente media hora de la ciudad de Portoviejo. La ciudad es muy conocida por los dulces que vende. El grupo Rocafuerte es muy unido, y las se\u00f1oras se llevan muy bien entre ellas. El d\u00eda de nuestra entrevista con Sra. Astromelia era el cumplea\u00f1os de una de las socias, por eso sirvieron unos bocaditos y cada socia aport\u00f3 un poco de dinero para regalarla. \n\nSra. Astromelia tiene 44 a\u00f1os, es casada, y tiene 4 hijos, de los cuales 2 son mayores de edad y 2 son menores (de 15 y 16 a\u00f1os). 3 de ellos viven con ella todav\u00eda. Ella y su esposo tienen un estudio de fotograf\u00eda, llamado \u201cEstudio Arely\u2019s\u201d por su hija, Arely. Su esposo tambi\u00e9n trabaja como profesor, entonces ella atiende el negocio durante la semana mientras \u00e9l est\u00e1 en clases. Su hija tambi\u00e9n les ayuda con el negocio. Iniciaron el negocio porque el sueldo de su marido no les alcanzaba para pagar sus necesidades b\u00e1sicas, y a ella no le gustaba mucho al inicio, pero ahora s\u00ed le gusta, aunque dice que siempre llega muy cansada a la casa al fin del d\u00eda. Trabajan todo tipo de eventos, como por ejemplo matrimonios y cumplea\u00f1os, normalmente 1-2 por semana, y trabajan tanto con c\u00e1maras digitales como de rollos. \n\nLa se\u00f1ora est\u00e1 pidiendo un cr\u00e9dito a la Fundaci\u00f3n ESPOIR para invertir en la compra de materiales para su negocio, como por ejemplo papel, qu\u00edmicos, \u00e1lbumes y una c\u00e1mara. Dice que su sue\u00f1o para el futuro es jubilarse para poder descansar, tambi\u00e9n est\u00e1 pensando en poner algun negocio en la misma casa para no tener que salir m\u00e1s de la casa para trabajar. \n\nElla ha sido socia de su banco comunal para a\u00f1os ya, es socia fundadora y el banquito en s\u00ed es bastante antiguo, el grupo ya tiene 32 ciclos trabajando juntos. \u201cMe ayudan bastante,\u201d dice de los pr\u00e9stamos. Solamente una vez hace 4 a\u00f1os tuvo un problema para pagar su cr\u00e9dito, aparte de eso ha sido muy puntual. \n","en":"Mrs. Astromelio is a member of the Rocafuerte Community Bank and is in a group of 21 women who live in the town of Rocafuerte, which is approximately half an hour from the city of Portoviejo. The city is very well-known for the sweets that it sells. The group Rocafuerte is very united, and the women get along very well. The day of the interview with Mrs. Astromelia was the birthday of one of the members, so they served snacks and every member contributed some money to give a gift.\r\n\r\nMrs. Astromelia is 44 years old, is married, and has 4 children, of whom 2 are adults and 2 are younger (15 and 16 years old). Three of her children still live with her. She and her husband have a photography studio, called \u201cArely\u2019s Studio,\u201d after their daughter Arely. Her husband also works as a teacher, so she takes care of the business during the week while he is in classes. Her daughter also helps them with the business. They started the business because her husband\u2019s salary isn\u2019t enough for them to meet their basic needs. At first, she didn\u2019t like the business very much, but now she enjoys it, even though she says that she is very tired when she comes home at the end of the day. They work at all kinds of events, like weddings and birthdays. They normally work once or twice a week, and they work with both digital cameras and cameras with film. \r\n\r\nShe is asking for a loan from Fundaci\u00f3n ESPOIR to invest in the purchase of materials for her business, like paper, chemicals, albums and a camera. She says that her dream for the future is to retire so that she can rest. She is also thinking about having some business in her own house so that she doesn\u2019t have to leave home to work.\r\n\r\nShe has been a member of the community bank for years. She is a founding member, and the bank is very experienced. The group has already worked together for 32 cycles. She says that the loans help her a lot. Only once, four years ago, she had a problem of repaying her loan, and apart from this, she has been very punctual.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Avni Shah, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":363549,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Photography","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"To buy paper, chemicals, albums and a camera for her business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Portoviejo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Astromelia Auxiliadora","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-07-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":550,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2009-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2009-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2009-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2009-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2009-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2009-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":68.75}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":277.72,"local_amount":277.72,"processed_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T17:47:04Z","rounded_local_amount":277.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87035134},{"amount":137.12,"local_amount":137.12,"processed_date":"2009-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T21:32:48Z","rounded_local_amount":137.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96947390},{"amount":66.41,"local_amount":66.41,"processed_date":"2009-11-11T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T12:29:53Z","rounded_local_amount":66.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103789235},{"amount":68.75,"local_amount":68.75,"processed_date":"2009-11-26T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T12:30:48Z","rounded_local_amount":68.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103789236}],"funded_date":"2009-09-01T19:49:47Z","paid_date":"2009-12-15T12:30:49Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Avni","image":null}},{"id":130906,"name":"Mary","description":{"languages":["es"],"texts":{"es":"La Sra.

This became worse when her two children had to go to college.\r\n\r\nWanting to sustain the education of her children in college, Cecilia had to make her business profitable by growing it. Thus, she decided to join ASHI to be able to have access to additional capital.\r\n\r\nFrom then on, Cecilia\u2019s business started to grow until the time has come when Cecilia now has to request a larger amount of capital. She has to increase the volume of the various fish she buys and sells in her fish stall in the municipality\u2019s public market.\r\n\r\nSomeday, Cecilia wishes that, out of the profit her business makes, she will be able to purchase a vehicle to be used in her business for selling and buying a larger volume of fish in far off places.\r\n\r\nCecilia is so happy for having loans for her business because her profits have enabled her to send her two children to college. Her eldest is a commerce graduate while the second child is a college undergraduate. Whatever life they will be having in the future, Cecilia will be very happy to turn over her business to her children

Half of the members sell snack food, the rest sell groceries and have a computer business.  Marisel Shirley, the president of the group, has been a wholesaler of telephone cards for the past 10 years.  Julia has had a snack business for 15 years.  AyD. has a snack shop and has also had a general store for 10 years.  Leoncia has been selling groceries for about 20 years.  Amanda has had a business for 6 years.

Freddy has had a small restaurant where he offers lunches and other meals for 23 years.  Nestor Hector has been making glass for 15 years.  \r\n\r\nAs you can see, in general the group has a great deal of experience in their respective areas.  As with all businesses in the country, there is competition, but the good thing is that each group has its season. This group is going to invest in order to make money during the Carnival parties.  The loan will be used to purchase more merchandise to stock a business such as a snack stand, or for a person who makes meals to have a stand in the market.  The people with computer businesses will purchase accessories that they will sell, the glass maker will purchase frames and glass for sale and for his monthly jobs.   \r\n\r\nThe business people who request loans from Agrocapital hope to improve their businesses with the help of the loan.  They hope to improve their children's education, improve their quality of life, and to grow and expand their businesses.  The members of this group are experienced with loans and are very accustomed to working with loans as they already know how to use them in their businesses.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michele Magrino, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3000,"image":{"id":478737,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Increase working capital","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-17 -65","type":"point"}},"partner_id":73,"posted_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:19Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":3000,"lender_count":98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marisel Shirley","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Julia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ayde","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Leoncia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Amanda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marcia Olivia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Angelica","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Ross Aurelio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Freddy","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nestor Hector","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":false}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-01-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":21025,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":3000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":1994.42},{"due_date":"2010-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":2017.69},{"due_date":"2010-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":2041.23},{"due_date":"2010-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":2065.04},{"due_date":"2010-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":2089.16},{"due_date":"2010-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":2113.52},{"due_date":"2010-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":2138.14},{"due_date":"2010-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":2163.07},{"due_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","amount":2188.3},{"due_date":"2010-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":2214.43}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":284.58},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":287.9},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":291.25},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":294.66},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":298.1},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":301.57},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":305.08},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":308.65},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":312.24},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":315.97}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":284.58,"local_amount":1994.42,"processed_date":"2010-02-08T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:00:39Z","rounded_local_amount":1997.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123909421},{"amount":287.9,"local_amount":2017.69,"processed_date":"2010-02-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:01:11Z","rounded_local_amount":2021.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123909422},{"amount":610.67,"local_amount":4279.78,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T08:56:21Z","rounded_local_amount":4286.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128944997},{"amount":880,"local_amount":6167.31,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-25T07:54:48Z","rounded_local_amount":6177.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136673336},{"amount":308.64,"local_amount":2163.07,"processed_date":"2010-05-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-12T08:10:10Z","rounded_local_amount":2166.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144707356},{"amount":312.24,"local_amount":2188.3,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-12T08:10:30Z","rounded_local_amount":2191.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144707357},{"amount":315.97,"local_amount":2214.43,"processed_date":"2010-06-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-12T08:10:52Z","rounded_local_amount":2218.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151890877}],"funded_date":"2010-02-15T23:29:39Z","paid_date":"2010-08-12T08:10:52Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Michele Magrino","image":387464}},{"id":176422,"name":"Soan","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Soan C. is from the village of Balulang, Cagayan de Oro City.

She is a very joyful young woman who really wants to get ahead in life. She lives with her husband in her mother's house and what she wants the most is to have a better future.\r\n\r\nSince the time she was very young, she felt that she had to work as much as she could. That is why, when she was 17 years old, she began to sell fast food. With those earnings she was able to get the money together that she needed to buy 2 cows. Together with the lambs that her mother gave her, she has been able to get ahead little by little by selling cattle.  \r\n\r\nWhat she likes the most about her job is feeding her animals, since she has a lot of affection for them. She has been doing this for 7 years and thinks that the hardest part is transporting her cattle to the city market. With time, she hopes to increase the  number of animals that she has, since she thinks that it is time to grow. \r\n\r\nThis is the fifth loan that Maximiliana has had with MFP.

He has learned to raise them well so that he can market them. Khusravjon is not married and lives with his large family. As the oldest brother, he has to work hard to support his family.

Tajikistan has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists, and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Today Tajikistan is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New Western culture, and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nTajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

Ella inici\u00f3 este negocio puerta a puerta  en el a\u00f1o 2004 entusiasmada por su c\u00f3nyuge,  que se dedica a la litograf\u00eda y  haciendo trabajos a los laboratorios conoci\u00f3 los que hoy son los  proveedores de Ruth Mar\u00eda y a los que  inici\u00f3 compr\u00e1ndole  $200.000 COP,   en productos naturales como los ya mencionados;    gradualmente  Ruth ha ido adicionando otros art\u00edculos, como ropa, fantas\u00edas, cosm\u00e9ticos y casi todo lo que sus clientes necesitan para su vida diaria, porque ha  aprovechado efectivamente  la gran clientela que se desprendi\u00f3 de su negocio inicial de venta de productos naturales. Sus principales clientes, son los habitantes del barrio y muchos referidos de estos en  otras comunidades; Ruth Mar\u00eda es una muy buena empresaria que les acredita  a sus clientes  solo lo que ellos pueden pagar  y en los plazos acordados, por eso recupera su cartera semanalmente y algunos en cada quincena. Ella compra de contado y adquiere frecuentemente descuentos, porque sus proveedores la conocen muy bien y a su vez sabe como negociar sus compras. Su margen de contribuci\u00f3n es del 40%   con respecto a los productos naturales,  recupera esta  inversi\u00f3n con la primera cuota, pero regularmente las  divide en 4   plazos de pago de acuerdo a cada cliente y tambi\u00e9n hace algunas excepciones con un peque\u00f1o n\u00famero de sus compradores ofreci\u00e9ndoles plazos especiales un poco m\u00e1s largos,  pero no muy usuales.  Relacionado con la mercanc\u00eda que distribuye su margen de contribuci\u00f3n  es de 45% y los planea con sus clientes en 2 cuotas. Su sue\u00f1o ahora es tener un punto de ventas en un sitio estrat\u00e9gico, pero sabe que se requiere un capital inicial importante y por eso est\u00e1 trabajando fuertemente para lograrlo. Con su Credikiva que es su primer financiamiento comprar\u00e1 productos naturales que tiene encargados por sus clientes y tambi\u00e9n jeans, calzado, ropa interior y especialmente vestidos para ni\u00f1os, teniendo en cuenta que en las fiestas los padres de familia vestir\u00e1n a sus peque\u00f1os con nueva ropa y estos a su vez lucir\u00e1n los vestidos de Ruth Mar\u00eda con mucha alegr\u00eda y distinci\u00f3n.\n\n","en":"Ruth Mar\u00eda N. lives in Soledad\u2019s Los Almendros neighborhood where she sells natural products and assorted merchandise.  It is quite usual to find vitamins and Omega 3 among other products like costume jewelry, and cosmetics in her store.  She also sells footwear, underwear and children\u2019s clothes.\r\n\r\nShe started the business around 2004 encouraged by her spouse to do so.  He is a lithographer and while doing jobs for laboratories he got to know the people who today are Ruth Maria\u2019s suppliers and from whom he originally bought $200,000COP worth of natural products like the ones already mentioned.\r\n\r\nGradually Ruth has been adding other items like: clothes, jewelry, cosmetics and almost everything else customers need in their daily lives because she\u2019s known how to take advantage of the vast clientele that her initial natural products business generated. Her main customers are residents of the neighborhood and referrals from them who live in other areas.\r\n\r\nRuth Mar\u00eda is quite a good businesswoman who floats her customers just the amount of credit they are able to repay in the time agreed upon.  Thus she recovers her outstanding debts weekly and some biweekly. She, however, pays cash so often gets discounts because her suppliers know her well and she is very good at negotiating her purchases.\r\n\r\nHer recovery margin on the natural products is 40% and she usually gets that back on the first installment.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from planting & harvesting  a variety of vegetables for sale. Marry has been engaged in her business for over five years and earns approximately 3,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Marry joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Marry has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional seeds, seedlings & young crops to raise. Marry is requesting a new loan of 7000 PHP which will be used to purchase fertilizers such as manure. This will be the 4th loan taken out by Marry from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay the tuition fees of her children. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 38 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas.

La chacra que ten\u00edan no era suficiente para mantenerse ya que los frutos, no ten\u00edan mucha rentabilidad, es por ello que decidi\u00f3 trabajar como empleada del hogar, donde conoci\u00f3 a Dagoberto que ahora es su querido esposo. Tiempos despu\u00e9s Adela con el poco ahorro que ten\u00eda m\u00e1s el de su esposo decidieron abrir un bar, donde ahora expenden licores, y toda clase de bebidas. Para ella los mejores d\u00edas de venta son los fines de semana y feriados, dicho bar cuenta con un amplio lugar de esparcimiento. Esta feliz con este negocio ya que le genera un buen ingreso econ\u00f3mico. Este es su primer cr\u00e9dito con MFP, por el que ella esta comprometida en cancelar puntualmente con el pago de sus cuotas. Adem\u00e1s est\u00e1 contenta con los de su banco comunal, porque son puntuales con el pago de sus cuotas. Con los 1,500 soles que solicita, lo invertir\u00e1 en la compra de m\u00e1s licores para abastecer su bar.\n\n","en":"Adela, 25, lives with Dagoberto, 24, and their son. They live in their own house located in the Silvia neighbourhood. \r\n\r\nAdela, who is consistent and fights for her goals, explains that a few years ago the financial situation in this part of the country suffered from stagnation due to social and economic instability. Because of this and the death of her mother and father she was unable to finish her schooling; she had 5 younger siblings to look after. The farm they had was not enough to support them as it wasn't very profitable. That's why she decided to work as maid, where she met Dagoberto, her beloved husband. \r\n\r\nSome time later, Adela and her husband used their small savings to open a bar, where they sell liquor and all kinds of drinks. For her the best days for the business are week-ends and holidays. The bar has plenty of room for recreation. She is happy with the business as it generates a good income. \r\n\r\nThis is her first loan with MFP. She is committed to repaying it on time. She is also very pleased with her community bank, because everyone repays the loans on time. She will invest the 1,500 soles requested in the purchase of liquor to stock up her bar."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":899459,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pub","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy liquor for her bar.

She comments that she needs a loan in order to buy items that she does not currently offer. She learned about Adim, a local organization, from a woman at the local market who works with the organization. She visited the office, gathered the information and formed her group, so they could all meet with Adim.\r\n\r\nYahaira has been working in this business for years. She learned the business from her mother. She hopes to get ahead with this loan together with her partners in the group; she hopes to be able to give her son a college education.\r\n\r\nShe travels 3 days of the week outside of her community, and one day of the week she goes to Managua to buy the clothing and spices. The other days she spends taking caring of her family and going to Adim to make the group's loan payment. She is very organized about her time and her business.\r\n\r\nHer husband helps pay the household expenses with his work on a farm. Yahaira plans to make improvements to their home. Yahaira has received several training courses; they have helped her to better manage her business.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Erin Corcoran, Kiva

Los Angeles Village Bank, which meets once a month in the town of Huayllacocha, where she lives. Zoila is sixty years old and is the widowed mother of three children, all of whom are now adults with families of their own. Zoila\u2019s main business is selling \u201cjora,\u201d the fermented corn used to make chicha, a traditional Andean corn beer. She buys dried corn in 14-kilo sacks for $7 apiece, soaks the corn to ferment it, and resells each 14-kilo sack for $10 soles to local chicha producers. She works seven days a week selling jora at the market in Izcuchaca, a large town about thirty minutes away that serves as a transportation and commerce hub for the Anta region. She usually works from 6:00 am to 3:00 or 4:00 pm, depending on business, and earns about $20 per day in profits.

She is fifty-five and is a mother of three children. Atyrgul and her husband are in the sheep-breeding business. In the beginning they had to save diligently in order to purchase their first livestock. Eventually they were able to buy a cow, and later they started to breed livestock and sell it as necessary. It is difficult to over-estimate the importance of having livestock for Atyrgul and her husband: with the income they earned they were able to build a house, give an education to their children, and even bought an apartment in the capital. Atyrgul and her husband also grow vegetables in their own garden. \r\n\r\nIn addition to the livestock-breeding business, Atyrgul keeps cows and sells milk. Just the monthly profit from the sale of milk is about 2700 soms (local currency). But twenty years ago, when they just started their livestock business, they were able to buy their first cow for only 1000 soms. Nowdays a cow costs almost twelve times as much. Atyrgul and her husband know the value of time. When they raised their children they tried their best to give them an education and the freedom to choose their profession. And the children have made their choice: they decided to go into police work. The eldest son is twenty-nine and is married. He is a police detective. The middle son is twenty-seven and he is not married yet. He works as as a detective as well. The youngest son  has not yet finished college. Atyrgul wants to purchase an additional dairy cow. Without a loan it will take her a long time to save up enough money. She really hopes to obtain this loan so she can realize her plans. She would would like to get her two younger sons married and also to increase the size of her flock. \r\n<p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAtyrgul has three partners in her group:\r\n\r\nRahat A. is thirty-seven. Rahat is raising four children. Her husband is a construction worker. Rahat stays at home and takes care of her five year-old-son. However, she also finds enough time to tend her livestock and sell milk. Rahat would like to get a loan to purchase a bull.\r\n\r\nRoza B. is forty-two. She and her husband tend to their sheep and cows. They are raising three children. The eldest daughter is sixteen, and the youngest son is seven. Roza is seeking a loan in order to purchase sheep for breeding.\r\n\r\nDinara O. is thirty-six. She is a mother of three children. Her spouse is a self-employed electrician. Dinara has a home-based retail business. She would like to get a loan in order to purchase a stock of goods to sell.\r\n<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance, a young and ambitious socially-focused MFI in Kyrgyzstan.\r\n\r\nMol Bulak Finance is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development on the basis of 3-Ps concept - People (building human capital and taking care of its customers and the society as well), Profit (to be profitable to grow further) and the Planet (taking care of the environment).

E. is the president of the loan group Nyota. Dressed in the black dress, she is raising her hand in the photo. She is a client on her 16th loan cycle, 34 years old, married, and mother of three children, all of whom attend school. Her husband is a small trader of various products. Kahambu W. E. sells diverse products like suitcases, small chain jewelry, dresses, blouses, pants, women's boubous (traditional clothing), skirts, shoes, etc. in her small shop. Sometimes family friends buy her products.\r\nShe began her business with her own funds from her husband. Her initial capital was $100. This allowed her to launch a business selling rice. A short time afterward, in collaboration with her husband, her business evolved into a small boutique. She has now done this work for 13 years.\r\nWith a loan from IMF Hekima, Kahambu W. E. wishes to increase her sales by purchasing six suitcases, four female boubous, six blouses, six skirts, and ten Manzaza chains. Kahambu's biggest challenge is that she still rents (at home and at her workplace). Thus, all of her business profits go to pay her rent, estimated at $20 per month. Sometimes, her lessor insists that she guarantee nine months' payment.\r\nIn the future, Kahambu W. E. plans to grow her business and leave the communal bank for a united group which offers many operational advantages in terms of increased credit, interest tax, and repayment deadlines. Moreover, in the near future, Kahambu wishes to buy a plot of land and, god willing, a car. In ten years, she intends to open a second boutique in the center of Goma. She plans on getting supplies from the world's large commercial centers, either in Dubai or in China.\r\nKahambu thanks the IMF Hekima for the loans she received without any material guarantee because, thanks to these loans, she has already equipped her house, she manages to meet her children's needs, and her business is prospering. \r\nThe Nyota group is made up of 16 members, the majority of whom are female.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Kelly Percival, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3500,"image":{"id":532491,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":["Conflict Zones"],"use":"Purchase of six suitcases, four female boubous, six blouses, six skirts, and ten Manzaza chains","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CD","country":"Congo (Dem.

It's for this reason that she has applied to Ceprodel for a loan that will allow her to buy construction materials for starting work on the project.\r\n<p>\r\nIt's important to stress that Ceprodel loans have benefited this lady and that she and her dear children who, more than ever, need their mother's support, will continue benefiting from them.\r\n<p><b>Translated from Spanish by Jere Wiseman, Kiva Volunteer<\/b><p>\r\nLa se\u00f1ora Brenda G. originaria del municipio de Condega es casada, con dos hijos de los cuales uno de ellos se encuentra en la edad escolar.

It is currently utilizing Kiva's 0% lending interest rate to return 9% of interest paid from borrowers to them in the form of a savings account at the end of their loans.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. A civil war, which began soon after independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still lives in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and its lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients have viable businesses. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the financial services they need.

in Los Chiles, located in the northern region of Costa Rica.\n\nLike many member of the Los Chiles community, Gabriel is a farmer and dedicates his time to the planting and harvest of various subsistence crops including tuber(a type of plant structure that stores nutrients) and chili peppers.\n\nGabriel is always busy: when he isn\u2019t tending to the needs of his own plot of land, he hires himself out as a laborer on a nearby farm. The money he earns helps to complement the income generated from the sale of his own produce.\n\nGabriel organizes his day so that in the morning he wakes up early, eats breakfast, and then feeds his cows and pigs. He spend six hours per day working as a laborer and in the afternoons he switches gears, taking on the work in his own fields.\n\nThis loan will be used to finance the production of Habanero chili peppers. Specifically, Gabriel will use this money to purchase seeds, fertilizer, tools, pesticides, and other materials and ingredients necessary for the production of chili peppers. All labor and transportation tasks will be carried out by Gabriel and his family.\n\nGabriel dedicates part of his time as a hired hand on a nearby farm. He worries about the coming harvesting season and hopes that he will be successful this year. Gabriel\u00b4s goals are to maintain stability in his family, achieve higher production rates, improve his economic situation, and offer a better standard of living to his family.\n\nA major difficulty and limitation for Gabriel has been his lack of working capital. He hopes to use this loan effectively to improve life on the farm for everyone.\n\nPiper and Capiscum Processors Compa\u00f1\u00eda Agr\u00edcola Industrial, or PROPICA, is an international buyer and seller of chili pepper and ground pepper products. In cooperation with Fundaci\u00f3n Mujer, PROPICA has guaranteed to purchase the agricultural products (the peppers) that are to be produced with the help of this loan.

Her husband is a farmer and cultivates cacao.  <p>\r\nNine months ago, Josefina took a loan from our organization and used it wisely and the loan has been repaid.  She invested the money in the purchase of beauty products such as hand and body lotion, hair treatment lotion, shampoo, rinse and other products for nails and the skin. That activity had a very positive impact on her life and her family.  With benefits from business, she could buy new uniforms and other school supplies so that her children could keep on going to school.

As more family members arrived, her house would fill with joy and love, but at the same time, the family expenses would increase. For this reason, Eusebia decided to buy and sell sheep for a living, and with diligence and perseverance she has been able to move this business forward.

They specialize in selling food spices and traditional utensils for cooking, etc. The relationship among the women of the Djiguiya group is one of neighborhood bonds and friendship. They are on their third solidarity loan from Soro Yiriwaso and all previous loans were repaid without problem. They get their supplies from a variety of sources depending on the item, but for utensils, they mainly buy their stock from local people in the surrounding villages. For food spices, they go to Bamako or S\u00e9gou. Sales take place in Konobougou, either at home or in the market, especially on market days when customers are itinerant merchants from neighboring towns and villages. With this loan, the members of the Djiguiya group expect to make a monthly profit of CFA 20,000, which they will use to pay the loan interest and invest the remainder in their respective businesses. \r\n\r\n<p><b>Translated from French by Sarah Llewellyn, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\nLes membres du groupe Djiguiya sont mari\u00e9s avec une moyenne d\u2019age de 37 ans et 7 enfants.

She is married and has six children. Currently, all her children are out of  school and independent. Rebecca\u2019s husband is a farmer. Rebecca, her husband, and two grandchildren live in the  family home, in the town of Oda, in eastern Ghana. Most of the people of Oda are either farmers or sell agricultural products. Very few people have non-farming businesses. \r\n\r\nRebecca is a baker and also sells in second-hand clothing. She buys fabric and second-hand clothes, including bed linens and men's and women's clothing, from Kumasi, a nearby city. She sells these items from a stand in the Oda market square. She also travels to nearby markets to sell her wares. Rebecca has been in this business for thirty-five years now and is asking for a loan to increase her working capital so that she can buy fabric and clothing in bulk. \r\n\r\nShe believes the loan would help her to expand to other market centers and eventually help improve her family's standard of living. She is a member of the \u201cNtoboase\u201d Trust Group.

However, she is very constant when it comes to her embroideries, as their complexity and thickness on the fabric take a month's work. The end result is a beautiful traditional garment, admired by her customers, who buy in cash. The most profitable period for her business is during the Feast of Santiago, which is widely celebrated in her area. She would like to increase the production of embroidered skirts and recruit more staff to help her. \r\n\r\nThis is her third loan with MFP. She is very happy to have financial backing because she has always proved to be responsible in the management of her payments. She also enjoys being part of her loan group because all members are responsible and very supportive. She thanks those managing the loan request, which will be very helpful in the development of her business. She will use the credit to buy more fabrics and yarns in different colours, as well as seeds and fertilizer for planting alfalfa.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Alba Sort , Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":574105,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Embroidery","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"Buy fabrics and yarns in different colours.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"HUANCAYO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.066667 -75.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-08-01T15:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":725,"lender_count":26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Victoria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-06-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":333},{"due_date":"2010-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":333},{"due_date":"2010-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":333},{"due_date":"2010-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":333},{"due_date":"2010-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":333},{"due_date":"2010-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":335}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120.71},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120.72},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120.71},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":120.71},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":120.71},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":121.44}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":241.43,"local_amount":666,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:40:13Z","rounded_local_amount":681.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166887452},{"amount":120.71,"local_amount":333,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:25:33Z","rounded_local_amount":340.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172154454},{"amount":120.71,"local_amount":333,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T15:14:13Z","rounded_local_amount":340.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177449763},{"amount":120.71,"local_amount":333,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:00:28Z","rounded_local_amount":340.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182588465},{"amount":121.44,"local_amount":335,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T14:05:20Z","rounded_local_amount":342.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188724969}],"funded_date":"2010-08-01T19:16:24Z","paid_date":"2011-01-15T14:05:20Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Alba Sort","image":550650}},{"id":221930,"name":"Con Esfuerzo Se Crece Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"The communal bank \"Con Esfuerzo se Crece\u201d (With Effort there is Growth) consists of 15 associates from the city of Vi\u00f1a del Mar.

Rasul is dedicated to farming activities and has been engaged in this activity for 20 years. Presently he is the father of two children.

His reason for coming to IMON International is to obtain a loan with which he will buy seeds and fertilizer for his crops.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n<P>\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She had benefitted from several \u201csolidarity\u201d loans (group loans) in the past, and is now on her 11th individual loan, which will allow her to purchases 15 sets of wax \u201cpagnes,\u201d six sets of embroidered cloth, and five sets of dyed \u201cbazins\u201d of mid-range quality in Bamako.

She is 42 years old. Yolanda is married and has four adult-aged children. To make a living, Yolanda owns and operates a service-based business. The main source of income for the business comes from providing hairdressing and beauty services to local community members. Yolanda has been engaged in her business for more than two years and earns approximately 9,000 Philippine pesos (PHP) a month from it.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Yolanda joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Yolanda has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from HSPFI, a Kiva partner. This previous loan was used to  purchase materials needed to provide service. \r\n\r\nYolanda is requesting a new loan of 7,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase materials needed to expand services provided. This will be the second loan taken out by Yolanda from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement the income of her family. \r\n\r\n<b>About HSPFI<\/b>\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

He and his family live in a ger, which is a traditional Mongolian nomadic tent. His oldest son attends a local secondary school. <p>\r\n\r\nErjan operates a meat-selling business in his province. He explains that herders drive herds anywhere from 100-200 km to sell their livestock in the capital city of the province. In Mongolia, it is common for a household to buy at least one cow and ten sheep to be eaten during the long Mongolian winters. People of this province usually prepare their meats for winter in October and November and finish those prepared meats in March. As a result, Erjan plans to sell his products during the spring season. He usually purchases livestock from herders and slaughters the livestock to sell at the local market.

Such companies as Bishkek-Sut and Vimm Bil Dan provide the residents with high quality milk products. According to statistics an average person consumes milk products at least once a day.\r\n\r\nBusara J., 47, is a leader of this group. She is married to a farmer and has a twelve-year-old daughter. She started her business of milk production in 2003 and hasn\u2019t regretted it at all. First she purchased a dairy cow and sold the generated milk to friends from the neighborhood every morning. Busara's business became so popular in the neighborhood that she had to buy more dairy cows in order to generate more milk. Soon local ice-cream and cake producers started purchasing her milk on a regular basis. They liked high quality of this raw material. The next idea was to diversify her products. Busara bought new equipment for making high sorted cheese, sour cream and butter. She loved how everything worked out and sold all of her products almost immediately. The reason Busara applied for this loan is that she\u2019s in need of new equipment for making milk products because her old one is getting exhausted. Busara\u2019s dream is a two-storied big house where her daughter would be happy to live. \r\n\r\n      --- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance (MBF), a young, ambitious and socially-focused Microfinance Institution in Kyrgyzstan. \r\nMBF is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development and upholds the triple bottom line \u2013 People (building human capital and taking care of its customers as well as society), Planet (keeping environmentally friendly) and Profit (earning revenue to expand autonomously).

lugar donde se encuentra en grupo, solo llegan los taxis especiales pero la gente casi nunca contrata este tipo de taxis ya que es muy caro y no tienen para pagar tanto dinero entonces deciden caminar.\nDecidieron ponerle Capilla San Juan as\u00ed porque el lugar donde se re\u00fane el grupo se encuentra a lado una capilla que es la m\u00e1s importante de la comunidad y San Juan porque as\u00ed se llama la comunidad donde se encuentra la capilla.\n\nLa se\u00f1ora Magdalena quien es la representante del grupo tiene 46 a\u00f1os de edad esta casad con el se\u00f1or Martin desde hace

su hija Anayeli  y por eso mismo le dieron la tienda escolar, en la actividad lleva ya 2 a\u00f1os de los cuales su \u00fanico problema fue que las ventas bajaron mucho ya que en la escuela le

and it has 11 members, two men and nine women.  All the members live in the same location where transportation is very scarce.  One has to walk several kilometers to reach the place where the group meets.  Only the special taxis go there but hardly anyone contracts this type of taxi because they are very expensive and they don\u2019t have enough money for them so they decide to walk.  They decided to call it Capilla San Juan because the place where the group meets is next to a chapel which is the most important one in the community and San Juan because that\u2019s the name of the community the chapel is located in.\n\nMagalena, 46, is group representative.  She\u2019s been married to Mart\u00edn for 29 years.  Four children were born to this couple and they are all still dependent.  Laura, 17, is no longer in school, Amalia, 15, is no longer in school either, Amancio, 12, who is in second year of secondary school and Anayeli, 9, who is in elementary school.\n\nMagdalena runs the school store where her daughter Anayeli attends which is why she was given this store.  She\u2019s been in business two years and the only difficulty she\u2019s had is that sales dropped very much when she was forbidden to sell sweets and junk food for the children.  This hurt sales because now children bring lunches from home and don\u2019t buy from Magdalena anymore.\n\nThis time she\u2019s asking for the loan to buy apples, oranges and one or the other sweet that she has been authorized to sell.  She also prepares meals but only for the teachers.\n\nHer goal is to manage to have another business where she can sell vegetables.  She and the group are grateful and they commented: \u201cThanks to the loan we\u2019ve been able to make our businesses grow and this has improved out quality of life.\u201d\n\nAll the group members will invest their loans differently.
