It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

Con los dos mil nuevos soles solicitados comprar\u00e1 mejores materiales para elaborar m\u00e1s tejidos artesanales y as\u00ed incrementar la cantidad que tiene en stock.","en":"Maritza is 19 years old and is a very cheerful, single young woman who lives in her parents' home and hopes to help them with household expenses. Though she is still very young, she is determined to work very hard so that she doesn't have to depend on her parents, since she thinks the moment has come for her to excel on her own. She is a weaver, and sells her work from her stand on the Laguna Temporal esplanade (a place in the city of Juliaca where markets are held). Her favorite part of the work is weaving. She has had this business for the past two years, and says that the most difficult part is moving the weavings to her stand, since it is very tiring. In the future, she hopes to have a very large store to sell hand-woven clothing, so that she can sell in a calmer environment and better serve her customers. \r\n\r\nMaritza has already taken out two previous loans from Microfinanzas Prisma. She has been very punctual with her payments, and has never had any problems with her village bank, where she is in charge of being cheerful and putting all her fellow group members in a good mood. With the requested loan of 2,000 soles, she will buy better materials to do more weavings and increase the number of weavings she has in stock. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Cynthia

Today, he grows many varieties of potatoes and sells them to wholesalers who seek him out for the quality of these tubers.\r\n<p>\r\nMarcelo lives comfortably from this work, which allows him to support his wife and children. He doesn\u2019t have a fixed schedule; he works from dawn until nightfall, and is always thinking about innovations in agricultural techniques. For example, he is working on a hybrid potato that will be larger. This is a short-term project that is nearly complete. Marcelo plans to continue with agriculture because he has so much experience and because it is profitable.\r\n<p>\r\nThis is Marcelo\u2019s third loan with MFP, and he promises to be punctual as always. It will be used to buy manure and fertilizer for his fields and also a better quality of seed, which will assure good production and a high yield in the future.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by jeffrey hersk, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":433610,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Purchase manure and fertilizers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-11-24T15:30:16Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":525,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marcelo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-10-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-28T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-27T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-26T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-27T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":525}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":525,"local_amount":1500,"processed_date":"2010-05-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:39:42Z","rounded_local_amount":1512,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144751227}],"funded_date":"2009-11-24T18:49:58Z","paid_date":"2010-06-15T09:39:42Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"jeff hersk","image":384019}},{"id":160270,"name":"Samuel","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Samuel is 27 years old and is married without children.

They both appear in the picture here.  Her husband helps her in her business, and often chops firewood in and around his community in order to make additional income. \r\n\r\nThis old couple lives with two school-aged children and earns a living by planting various crops on their own farmland.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She has been involved in her business for more than 10 years. She is married to Florante G., a farmer, and is a diligent and careful mother of four children.\r\n\r\nMercedes' husband's income is not enough to meet the needs of their family. In 2000, Mercedes got the idea of joining ASHI (Ahon SA Hirap, Inc.), an MFI and KIVA partner in the Philippines. She was given hope and a way to have access to capital, so she started her sari-sari store (a small retail business selling different goods). The business went smoothly and brings them good income. Mercedes also got the idea to put up capital for a canteen eatery (preparation of ready-to-eat food) because of the demand.\r\n\r\nCurrently on her seventh loan, Mercedes proposes the amount of Php 35,000 as additional capital to purchase stock and more supplies for her consumers' demands. Stock includes items such as soft drinks, beer, drinks, meat, fish, vegetables, rice, Fundador, cooking oil, sugar, etc.\r\n\r\nMercedes has disciplined herself to use all of the borrowed capital from ASHI-KIVA for her business, to gain more profit and to use that profit to support daily expenses. She got involved in ASHI (10 years) for the dreams of her family, to send her children to school and to finish their studies with a degree. Actually, she has already completed half of her dreams because her children have their degrees but she didn\u2019t stop dreaming for her grandchildren, to offer them the best education, as she provided for her children. The couple feels very happy with the loan that changed their lives to be better than before. Mercedes wishes all lenders all the best and good luck and will continue to support her family and the expanded business.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":444152,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

She gets her supplies of these products wholesale at the S\u00e9gou Grand Market.  To make incense, Magnonkiss\u00e8ni is soaked in eau de cologne for at least 3 days, then fragrance is added.  The product obtained is then divided among bottles that will be sold retail to a clientele composed for the most part of women. Mrs. Aminata hopes to make an average monthly profit of 20,000 CFA from this loan which will be used to reinvest in the business and to take care of the family\u2019s everyday expenses.

Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Monica has full knowledge of this but always finds a way to come through. \n\nMonica is from a remote village in the Kapsowar area of Kenya and she is elegant and admirable in spirit and effort. She is a role model, a mentor and an inspiration to many young farmers in her village because of her resilience despite personal challenges and her passion to support her three children as the primary caregiver. For the past 8 years, she has been involved in mixed farming, and her primary source of income has been growing maize and vegetables and also keeping dairy cows. Monica has been able to provide nutritious food for her family.\n\nMonica is requesting a loan to build a modern dairy unit. A good dairy unit provides a good place where cows can relax and also prevent them from diseases that may arise because of being exposed to harsh weather conditions such as rain. Monica believes that through this loan her living conditions will change because she is going to have an increase in milk production. She will save money that she used to spend on treating her cows because she lacked a good dairy unit.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.<\/p> \r\n\r\n<p>But, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.<\/p> \r\n\r\n<p>IMON's History<\/p>\r\n<p>Since December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

She has been engaged in this business for over three years and earns approximately 350 WST a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Loluama joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. She is now requesting a loan of 1,000 WST which will be used to purchase general farm supplies and equipment. The loan will be her first from SPBD. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD:\r\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.\r\n\r\n\r\n *Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

His parents are deceased, but he has a sister who occasionally visits him. Years ago, he worked as a laborer at various jobs in the city of Santa Ana.  He managed to save enough money to buy a plot of land.  He decided to grow bananas, which has proven to be very profitable.  He harvested bananas every two weeks, and sometimes weekly.\r\n<p>\r\nRa\u00fal recently moved to the community called \u201cSanchirio\u201d and is already making new friends.

He expects his first harvest of bananas to be ready in less than 3 months.  Initially, he thought it would be best to negotiate with buyers who pass through the area.

He is 39 and is the father of three children, whose ages range from 4 to 10 years old.  They study in the local public scool.  He studied until seventh grade but inevitably had to stop to fulfill his obligatory military service.  He lives with his wife and children in their own home.  He has sent some money to his mother, who lives in the city of Maputo.  He left Panda (and Inhambane) in 1987 to go to the city of Xai-Xai, where he fulfilled his obligatory military service, and four years later, he was able to leave the service.  He now works for a train company in Mozambique.  In addition to working for this company, Joane and his wife sell basic goods (oil, mayonnaise, sugar, corn flour, beverages, etc.) in their own location.  He learned to run his business from friends 19 years ago.  He sells mostly cooking oil and earns monthly wages of 10,000 Mozambique meticais.  He acquires his product locally.  In his company, he received a monthly salary of 7,500 meticais, which he uses to feed his family and will use to make his payments.  He has never had credits from another bank.  This is Joane's fourth loan, and it is in the amount of 12,000 meticais.  He will use it to buy basic goods to sell.  His previous credits were for 5200, 8000, and 9000 meticais, which were all for the same activity and were paid back without any problems.  He proposes to pay his credit back as soon as possible to be able to receive more loans with the objective of expanding his location.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Tanya Harper, Kiva

He has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10,000 PHP from HSPFI and is now requesting a new loan of 13,000 PHP which will be used to improve his service to passengers. It will be the fourth loan he has taken out from HSPFI. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

The women live in traditional families. They are on the average 36 years old and have five children.\r\nTheir main business is growing peanuts. In order to make their agricultural work profitable, they have decided to join the Soro Yiriwaso credit program, and are now on their first agricultural loan. \r\n\r\nHawa S. plans to use her loan to purchase a sufficient supply of peanut seeds, small tools and agricultural inputs, specifically at the big market in Tene.

After selling her products, Hawa S. plans to earn an income, of 40,000 West African francs, which will be used to pay off the loan interest and cover ongoing family expenses. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Ekaterina Sukhanova, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":850,"image":{"id":567429,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"Purchasing agricultural inputs, seeds and small tools","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sesso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":850,"lender_count":28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hawa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Aissata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Badouba ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hawa Ali ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fanta ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Diomine ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dicko Yaya ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Aissa Seydou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Man","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Benini ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":440000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":440000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":850}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":850,"local_amount":440000,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-16T08:56:23Z","rounded_local_amount":442589.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195917821}],"funded_date":"2010-08-03T20:43:13Z","paid_date":"2011-03-16T08:56:23Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Katharina S","image":340594}},{"id":218286,"name":"Angelina Selina Adhiambo","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Angeline Selina Adhiambo O. is 45 years old.

She is a single mother who adores her 9 year old daughter Yusbeth.  They live together in their own home located in the city of Chiras.  Ten years ago, she started working in agriculture growing potatoes and peas which she sells in the city's central market.  As a capable, enterprising woman, she has decided to expand her business now that her daughter is growing and needs more of her time.  She took the small amount of money she saved and bought a small stand in the local market.  She sells potatoes and vegetables to the locals who come to buy food for their lunches everyday.  In the future, she would like to buy more land to grow more potatoes which she could sell in the country's capital.  This is her first loan through MFP and she is very grateful to belong to the village bank which she is sure will help her move forward.  She will use the loan to buy more potato seeds."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":618376,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Comprar

from Dar es Salaam, Tanzania! This is 28-year-old Zainabu R., who is married and has two children aged four and nine. She has two other dependents who live with her because they are attending school in the area..  In 2008, Zainabu established her charcoal business. Working six days a week, and 11 hours a day, she earns about $230 every month. She now requests a loan in order to purchase additional stocks of charcoal. In the future, Zainabu plans to to increase the quantity and range of her stock.  She thanks you for your support. <P>These small, black, and dirty pieces of dry earth are important not just to charcoal sellers but to their customers, who rely on charcoal to cook their meals. Many Tanzanians still use small coal pots, in which they arrange mkaa (charcoal), and add either paper, dry grass, old plastic bags or kerosene in order to light them.

For the last 20 years she has worked in the traveling sale of \"anticuchos\" (kebabs of beef-heart meat), she has put much effort and dedication into this work to be able to afford her son's expenses who has high expenses costs because of his studies.  Livia leaves for work from 5 in the afternoon to sell the \"anticuchos\" and she stays until she has run out of all she has prepared, usually at about 9 or 10 at night.  The difficulty with her work is the instability of beef prices which increase often, making her have to charge more for her \"anticuchos.\"  But she knows how to contend with these little details and to enjoy her work.  She has made new friends which is something that she likes the most.  Livia works to get her son Rafael ahead.  He is in high school.  With the money that she requests she will be able to purchase a new grill to cook her \"anticuchos\" and some benches to better serve her clientele.

It was the location for the end of Alexander the Great's rule, and is known for its great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country, with its epic mountain passes, is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mix of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the USSR, damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 per cent of the country is mountainous and only 7 per cent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands of people to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

The group chose the name since it's a very beautiful stone and it is motivating since they're considered valuable people for each of their families.\r\n\r\nThe group is located in Atlacomulco, Mexico. It is a community that is distinguished by being very responsible and of moral quality. Additionally, it is a  group that is very aware of the constant changing nature of the economy and they always request what they can repay. Andrea E. is one of the members of the group. She is 41 years old, is married and has a 10 year old son. She finished elementary school, but notes that, unfortunately, she couldn't continue her education because of the responsibility she acquired in her home and with her family. Currently, she is dedicated to sewing and selling plastic items. Her sewing is very good quality and is the product that stands out most from everything she sells due to the fact that few people are dedicated to this type of work because of the time required. Despite this, Andrea likes her work and considers it to be the foundation for her to sell day after day and get ahead.\r\n\r\nAndrea's goal in requesting this loan is to gradually grow her business and, from the income she obtains, to help her son finish his education since she was never able to do so due to the shortcomings of her life.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2425,"image":{"id":618413,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cloth & Dressmaking Supplies","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To grow their business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Atlacomulco, Estado de M\u00e9xico","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":158,"posted_date":"2010-10-17T15:50:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2425,"lender_count":78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Reyna","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Antonia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Guadalupe Zenaida","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Andrea","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Magdalena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosa Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Elizabeth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Teresa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Natividad","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-10-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":30000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":2425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1540},{"due_date":"2010-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1579},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1620},{"due_date":"2010-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":1662},{"due_date":"2010-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":1704},{"due_date":"2010-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":1748},{"due_date":"2010-11-29T08:00:00Z","amount":1793},{"due_date":"2010-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":1839},{"due_date":"2010-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":1886},{"due_date":"2010-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":1934},{"due_date":"2010-12-27T08:00:00Z","amount":1984},{"due_date":"2011-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":2035},{"due_date":"2011-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":2087},{"due_date":"2011-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":2141},{"due_date":"2011-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":2196},{"due_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","amount":2252}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":124.48},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":127.64},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":130.95},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":134.34},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":137.74},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":141.3},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":144.94},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":148.65},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":152.45},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":156.33},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":160.37},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":164.5},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":168.7},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":173.06},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":177.51},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":182.04}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":383.07,"local_amount":4739,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T13:29:15Z","rounded_local_amount":4754.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177387599},{"amount":558.32,"local_amount":6907,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T13:40:27Z","rounded_local_amount":6930.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182525495},{"amount":782.3,"local_amount":9678,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T12:49:01Z","rounded_local_amount":9710.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188660038},{"amount":701.31,"local_amount":8676,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T02:39:25Z","rounded_local_amount":8704.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191403307}],"funded_date":"2010-10-17T19:27:14Z","paid_date":"2011-02-16T02:39:25Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":242892,"name":"Francisca","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Helena Musyoka is 35 years-old and married with six children aged between five and 14 years-old.

With the profits he hopes to make from the proceeds of this loan he plans to rent a permanent shop. \r\n\r\nJames believes he is hard working and he only needs the resources to attain his goals.  In the future, he hopes to grow his business and build a house and be running the shop on his own

Aun que posee un capital de trabajo, muchas veces requiere de m\u00e1s dinero para responder a los clientes, pues aun no tiene todo lo que ellos piden y su meta es tener   un poco  de cada producto para que ellos encuentren   lo necesario y Nerly logre el posicionamiento de su negocio.\nEste es su primer financiamiento con la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo y tambi\u00e9n su primer  credikiva con el cual  comprar\u00e1 \u00fatiles escolares, interiores, accesorios de vestir y sandalias, aprovechando la temporada escolar, que es la que impera en este momento, en el que j\u00f3venes y adultos ingresan a clases y sus productos rotan frecuentemente.\n\n","en":"Nerly G. has her own business selling stationery supplies, cosmetics and ladies' accessories.  With a little bit of capital she began selling beauty products and was so successful once she established a customer base that she decided to reinvest her earnings.  She added three display cases to enhance her corporate image and began growing in the market.  Through her business she has been able to cover her personal expenses and meet her son's needs.  \r\n\r\nHer dream and biggest challenge is to expand and have a shop one day so she can increase earning and give her son a good education so he can have a successful career.  Though she has her own working capital, many times she needs more money to meet customer demand.  Her goal is to be able to stock a little bit of everything so she can position her business well.\r\n\r\nThis is Nerly's first loan through the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation.  She plans to use it to buy school material, clothing accessories and sandals for the school year which is about to begin.  Her products have a high rotation rate now that youths and adults are going back to school.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":717471,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Paper

Her oldest son works in the Russian Federation as a construction worker and sends money to his mother every month to cover family expenses.  Mavchuda was able to marry off her daughter with the help of her son because her goods turnover is not high and neither is the profit, which is only enough to cover household expenses.

Q. previously lived in Zamboanga del Sur on the island of Mindanao together with her family, but the family decided to move back to Negros Occidental in 1991. Before they left Zamboanga del Sur, they sold their property so that they could have enough capital to start a new life in Negros. When they arrived in Negros, they used the money to buy land and planted fruit-bearing trees like calamansi, guava, and pineapple.\r\n\r\nToday Chenita is 49 years old and lives in the village of Sitio Minahan, Brgy. Odiong, Moises Padilla, Negros Occidenal. She is married to Abuncio who takes care of their farm. The couple is blessed with three children who are 12 to 20 years of age, and are all still going to school. Her older son plans to join the military in Bulacan when he graduates from the Negros State College of Agriculture in Kabankalan City, and this is why Chenita and her husband are working really hard so that they can help their son reach his goals.\r\n\r\nTheir small farm earned a good income for the family and Chenita started a pig-fattening business to supplement their income from the farm. In 1998, Chenita joined NWTF-Project Dungganon because she needed fresh capital to buy fertilizer and other necessities for the farm and her pig-fattening business. When she paid off her loan, she borrowed new capital and started to sell generic medicine in her community. For all her efforts she earns a $340 monthly income from her various businesses.\r\n\r\nPreviously, for her 14th cycle loan, she borrowed Php 11,000 to use as capital for her businesses. That loan was fully paid in full and on time without any delays. For her 15th cycle loan she is borrowing Php 20,000 to use as additional working capital for her generic medicine business and to buy fertilizer for their farm.  Whatever additional income results from the loan will be used for the education of her children and for the expansion of the businesses.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the calling of not just of a few but thousands of women. Through the alleviation program, these women have progressed from earning less than a measly $1 a day to surpassing realities beyond their dreams. They have learned to live a life where they can finally be called honorable. This is Project Dungganon.

She owns a business venture, planting & harvesting taro for sale.  Soli has many years of experience in this business.  Soli needs a loan of WST $1250 to purchase weed-killers such as Gramoxome.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 150 tala or US $63 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Soli joined SPBD.    This is her 2nd loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Soli's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Soli L. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                2 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              2 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.9 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              1.5 out of 3\r\n\r\nYou can view pictures of a typical plantation in Samoa, taken by a Kiva Fellow, at:   http:\/\/picasaweb.google.com\/agnes.p.chu\/SamoanPlantation\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/www.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

She is 67 years old and single.\r\n\r\nEven as she is getting on in years, Marilou is still working and doing business to earn a living to support herself and her nephew who is her dependent. She also works hard so that she will have enough savings to support herself and stay independent in her old age.\r\n\r\nTo prepare for her future and to have a stable source of income, Marilou put up a general store adjacent to her house. She sells different kinds of household products for the mothers, and goodies such as candies for the children of the neighborhood.\r\n\r\nIn 2000 Marilou joined NWTF-Project Dungganon to help her business expand. From that loan she was able to buy additional products for her general store and was able to put up a new food-vending business. Her good performance and dedication to improve her business was rewarded by her increasing income capacity which, in turn, allows her to borrow bigger loans to sustain her business expansion.\r\n\r\nWhen she was able to borrow a bigger amount, Marilou started raising pigs in her backyard to supplement her income and to have more savings for her future. Her combined business income is PHP 4,000 per month and it helps her support her household and send her nephew to school.\r\n\r\nFor her 13th loan she was able to obtain PHP 16,000 and it was used as working capital. Her loan was repaid on time and in full without any delays in any of the weekly installments. For her next, 14th, loan she is borrowing the same amount of PHP 16,000, again as additional capital for her businesses. The income from this her increased business will be used for her household needs and for the renovation of her store.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b> About NWTF:<\/b>\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the call of not just a few, but thousands of women.
