She is a widow. Her husband passed away fives years ago and she is left with four children. Her husband left her a small amount of sheep. Today her son shepherds the herd. Her son is 25 years old and not married yet. He needs a lot of money to get married, but at this time the money is only enough for their life. He wanted to go to Russia, but Tochiniso has convinced him not too and told him that he needs to work hard this summer by buying and selling cattle, and in the fall he can have a wedding. Tochiniso decided to help her son by taking out a loan.

Nusa Tenggara Province. Merbaun Village is situated about 42 km from Kupang City, the capital city of East Nusa Tenggara Province. The last 6 km of road used to enter Merbaun Village is in a really bad condition. This is why it takes about two hours to drive from Kupang City to Merbaun. \r\n<p>\r\nThere are many coconut, banana and betel nut trees growing in Merbaun Village. The local community relies on the agricultural sector to support their families. The challenge for the Merbaun community is the availability of public transport in the village. Such transport is only available twice a week, limiting the opportunities farmers have for going to market to sell their products. Generally, the houses in this area are constructed simply and have no electricity supply. Even though electricity is available in this area, the community cannot afford it as the installation cost is quite expensive. \r\n<p>\r\nNekaruut B group is led by a 33-year-old farmer, Ferdinan P.. He is married and blessed with two children: Marthen P., 9, in the third grade of elementary school, and Iwan P., 7, in the first grade of elementary school. Like many other farmers, Ferdinan relies on farming to generate money to meet his family's needs. He usually sells coconuts and bananas from his own farm at the market. Sometimes the coconuts and bananas that Ferdinan brings to the market do not all sell, and he has to bring them back to the village and sell them at a cheaper price. This is the only way for him to make money as he doesn\u2019t have any other business. For two years Ferdinan fattened cattle owned by an entrepreneur from Kupang, but he felt that the fee was insufficient to meet his family's needs. He really wants to better provide for his family but his lack of capital is the main issue. \r\n<p>\r\nThe situation that Ferdinan faces motivated him to join the TLM cattle-fattening program. The hope for a better future and his experience in fattening cattle has given him the self-confidence to join the program. Ferdinan is requesting a loan of 3,400,000 IDR from Kiva partner TLM to buy young cattle to fatten in 12 months. He hopes that this loan will help him better meet his family's needs. The other group members are also requesting loans to buy young cattle. They hope their loans lead them to a better life.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2875,"image":{"id":414127,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy cattle to be fattened","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Merbaun","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":129,"posted_date":"2009-10-29T00:58:54Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2875,"lender_count":86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ferdinan","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Efi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Margarita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Oktoviana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Damaris","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Asnat","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Margarita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-10-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"IDR","disbursal_amount":27000000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":2875,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":27000000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":2875}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":2875,"local_amount":27000000,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-02T09:02:48Z","rounded_local_amount":27096874.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166921836}],"funded_date":"2009-10-30T23:58:24Z","paid_date":"2010-10-02T09:02:49Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Paul & Rachel Norridge","image":828426}},{"id":151672,"name":"Mrs. Rim Meak Village Bank Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Twelve people who are all living in Rim M. village in Takeo province make up this village bank loan.

A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.

She is 46 years old and married to Virgilio, 46, who is a fisherman. She is a caring mother of two children who are both of minor age. She lives in the coastal place of Talim Island, town of Binangonan, Rizal Province, in the Philippines. \r\n\r\nIn 2007, she joined ASHI (Ahon SA Hirap, Inc.), an MFI and Kiva partner in the Philippines, with an opportunity of having start-up funds for generating income. Since she received loans from ASHI, she carefully invested it in her fishing business and it gave her reasonable earnings. \r\n\r\nNow on her fourth loan, she requests 20,000 Philippine pesos for additional working capital for her fishing business. Specifically, the amount will be used to purchase a fishnet, rope, bamboo, fingerlings (young or very small fish) and labor expenses. She also plans to buy one motorboat to consistently visit their fish pond.\r\n\r\nAs a mother, Arlene dreams of sending her two children to school and on to completing college degrees and finding jobs for healthier lives. She also enjoys considering that the loan from ASHI will change their lives and provide her family's needs. She also dreams of building a big house for her family to live in.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":479151,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fishing","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Purchase

She is 46 years old. Arceli is the group leader of a 8-member group loan offered by ASKI.

The official name of this borrowing group is Arceli B..\r\n\r\nArceli is married and has 3 school-aged children. To make a living, Arceli owns & operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising livestock. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from raising pigs for fattening and sale. Arceli has been engaged in her business for over 15 years and earns approximately 3000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Arceli joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Arceli has successfully repaid a previous loan of 15,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase baby livestock to raise & sell in the future. Arceli is requesting a new loan of 5000 PHP, which will be used to purchase breeding livestock. This loan will be the 7th loan taken out by Arceli from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 38 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Las fuerza y vitalidad de est\u00e1 mujer es sorprendente. Hace 2 a\u00f1os que sufri\u00f3 la muerte de su nuera, la esposa de su hijo mayor; desde entonces lo apoya con el cuidado de Yeraldine de tan solo 3 a\u00f1os de edad. Sola y con muchas responsabilidades Teodosia, pudo salir adelante; cada d\u00eda agradece a Dios por ello; ya que en los \u00faltimos meses adquiri\u00f3 una peque\u00f1o local donde pueda vender los ricos platos de comida que cocina; est\u00e1 actividad le resulta rentable a ella; los pobladores conocen de su exquisito sabor, pues antes vend\u00eda en una esquina de la plaza principal de su comunidad, sin un lugar acogedor para sus clientes. Asimismo siembra diversos frutos de la zona, en una huerta que tiene en su casa, que le sirven para su consuno y de vez en cuando los comercializa al menudeo.

She works very hard to take care of her two dependent children, Noe aged 18 and Brigit aged 15. She is raising them in her own house located in Cuenca Alta in the Peruvian rainforest (in the community of Las Palmas). \r\n\r\nThe strength and vitality of this woman are amazing. Two years ago her daughter-in-law died. Since then she has been helping her oldest son take care of 3-year old Yeraldine. Alone and with many responsibilities, Teodesia was able to move on and she is grateful to God for that.  In the last few months she has obtained a small stall where she sells the delicious food that she has cooked, and that is proving a profitable enterprise. The local people know that she is a good cook as she used to sell food in a corner of the main square, not a very comfortable place for her customers. Teodesia also grows various local fruits in a garden at her house. This produce is mostly eaten by the family but occasionally she has enough to sell. \r\n\r\nA short time ago she suffered another attack of kidney stones, but even that didn\u2019t discourage her. \r\n\r\nNow, with help from her community bank, she wants to buy materials for a new restaurant. She wishes to make a name for herself in the work she most enjoys: cooking. Teodesia belongs to La Palmeras Community Bank. This is her second loan with Kiva partner MFP, and she hopes that with their assistance she will be able to achieve her goals. She promises to pay back the loan on schedule as she did with previous loans.\r\n\r\nTeodesia is grateful to be part of a community bank as all the members are responsible, committed people. Once she has received the loan, she plans to buy bags of rice and sugar to use in the wonderful local dishes that she cooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":802117,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy bags of rice and sugar","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Chanchamayo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.05 -75.316667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-06-29T15:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Teodosia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-29T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-27T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-27T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":375}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":375,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:27:41Z","rounded_local_amount":1034.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270098500}],"funded_date":"2011-06-30T12:59:58Z","paid_date":"2012-04-15T10:27:41Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jane A"}},{"id":316295,"name":"Arlene","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Arlene is a hardworking entrepreneur who has a business buying and selling herbal products in the Philippines. \n\nShe is borrowing 25,000 PHP through NWTF to purchase additional stocks of herbal products to sell.

key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is 31 years old and lives with her husband and her 13-year-old daughter, who attends school. She also cares for 2 nephews who live with her in her home. Each month she manages to put 1500 Meticales in savings because she is helped out financially by her husband, who owns a rhyolite mine.\r\n\r\nAdelia moved with her older sister to Vila de Namaacha on the border with Swaziland, thinking that they would go to school there. After they arrived, however, they couldn't enroll in school because of a lack of complete documentation. She then met her husband and moved in with him. Her husband emigrated to South Africa and left her with some funds, which she used to start her own business. She was able to set up a stall in Jermantino, which is 7 kilometers from her town and is very popular because it is located on the main road. After some years, Adelia's husband returned and they decided to buy land on which they could mine rhyolite. He decided to stay in order to take care of his business personally. Adelia has 5 workers to help her, who earn 1500 Meticales per month. However, because of the cost of the mine construction, Adelia is barely able to cover all her expenses and she has asked Hluvuku for a loan in the amount of 8000 Meticales to strengthen her business. Her best products are fish, beans, and drinks. She earns 4000 Meticales each month, and spends 10,000 Meticales each time she travels.\r\n\r\nThis is Adelia's first loan with Hluvuku and Kiva. The 8000 Meticales will be used to buy products for her store. She is confident that she will repay the loan promptly. She will then ask for another loan to acquire more tools for extracting the rhyolite, because the ones she currently has are worn down,\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Catherine

They are all married and the mothers of at least two children, with the exception of Lob\u00e9 M. (group leader); however, she is entirely responsible for one of her nephews, who is in school. The women of the group are between 21 and 40 years old, with the exception of the first four standing on the left, who are in their forties. They are developing diverse businesses, such as sales of clothing, cosmetics, and fishing supplies. Others raise poultry and fatten sheep.\r\n\r\nFor reasons related to the health of her child, Mrs. Adji A\u00efda M. could not be present for the photo. She is assistant group leader; she is 21 years old. She raises poultry and fattens sheep, and she is assisted in her business by her husband.\r\n\r\nMiss Lob\u00e9 M., second from the right on the front row and also in closeup, is the group leader. She is the youngest of the group, but she became group leader thanks to her diligence, dependability, and understanding of community spirit. She is 21 years old, single, and childless, although she supports her sister's son. Since joining the \"Banc Villageois\" in 2009, she has been selling perfume. Her new loan will allow her to develop and market her business. Her goals are to build her savings level and to pay her personal expenses, as well as those of the child she supports.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Robin Clochard, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2625,"image":{"id":558522,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Strengthen the business activities of group members","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SN","country":"Senegal","town":"Agence de Thi\u00e8s","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"14 -14","type":"point"}},"partner_id":105,"posted_date":"2010-06-22T16:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2625,"lender_count":75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Aminata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ndeye Awa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"A\u00efda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mbene ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lobe","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sokhna","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dieumbe","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Adji A\u00efda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Madjiguene","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bintou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Madeleine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Aminata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatou Lota","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Absatou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ndeye Diarry","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nabou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-06-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":1395000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":2625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":1395000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":2625}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":2625,"local_amount":1395000,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T12:42:37Z","rounded_local_amount":1399864.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188652496}],"funded_date":"2010-06-23T08:36:47Z","paid_date":"2011-01-15T12:42:37Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Robin Clochard","image":830278}},{"id":213865,"name":"Segundo","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Segundo tiene 69 a\u00f1os, vive con su esposa y sus 3 hijos en su casa propia.

At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income to meet their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nYolanda operates a variety store where she also sells native breakfast fare and other items. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience outlet which sells groceries, toiletries and beverages in small amounts to people who live in the neighborhood. It is the place where you go to buy one package of shampoo, for example, or a small amount of cooking oil, or an egg. She generates her income by buying supplies wholesale and selling at retail.  Her store is next to her house and her regular customers are neighbors and people who live in her community.  She generates a minimum of Php 200 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo continue operating her business, she is requesting a PHP 14,000 loan. She will use this loan to buy more groceries, toiletries and beverages and expand her inventory. She expects a boost in income from this expansion of her business.\r\n  \r\nYolanda dreams of being able to renovate her house soon, and faithfully meets up with co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet weekly.

She is 38 years old and mother of 4 children. She was abandoned by her husband who went to South Africa in 2004 to look for work, and never returned. Besides supporting her 4 children, she also supports and houses 3 nieces and nephews who lost their parent as victims to HIV. \r\n\r\nAida studied until the 5th grade, and then had to stop due to lack of finances. In 2005 she moved from the city of Maputo to Ponta, looking for better conditions. In Maputo she sold many products, but the family was too big. She decided to go to Ponta when she heard of the prices in her sister\u2019s company, who had lived there for many years. Aida now lives at her sister\u2019s house.\r\n\r\nAida is a vendor at the Ponta market. She has a small establishment where she sells mostly tomatoes and onions, purchased in South Africa, three times a week. Aida has been doing this kind of activity since she was a child, when she sold fried fish. Aida earns about 800,00 MT a day. \r\n\r\nThis is Aida\u2019s second loan, although she has never requested one through another institution. She discovered Hluvuku-Adsema through friends who were already clients.

She lives with her husband and children in the Darsalam district of the city of S\u00e9gou (fourth administrative region of the Republic of Mali).  A personal secretary by training, she essentially invested herself, upon marrying, into commercial business, notably in incense and clothing.  She enjoys an enormous reputation today, especially during the marriage season, among women in S\u00e9gou. \r\n\r\nWith the goal of augmenting her working capital, in order to satisfy her burgeoning customer base, she turned toward Soro Yiriwaso, with which she has been associated for 42 months.  After two individual loans and three solidarity loans, all correctly repaid, she is now on her third individual loan.  This new loan will be used to buy a bolt of rich damask fabric, two bolts of less-rich damask, and ten bolts of Hitarget <i>pagnes<\/i> (colorful West African cloth).  Supplies are gotten from wholesalers at the grand marketplace of Bamako (capital of Mali).  Sales are made at the retail level out of her home, cash or credit accepted, to customers composed of men and women. \r\n\r\nShe intends to realize an average monthly profit of 50,000 francs CFA that will be put into savings, covering certain expenses, and repaying the loan.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva

She is a tailor who offers her great services to her neighbors. Her earnings are used to help cover her household expenses. Her work and her financial contribution have enhanced her self-esteem and her self-confidence. Djumagul is very proud of her work. This is the third time that Djumagul has requested a loan from IMON International, a Kiva partner. Having said this, Djumagul has an excellent history of on-time repayment. \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes being a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

She has five children: four daughters and one son. Even though one of her daughters is married and her son has gone to Moscow to work, after having reached the age of forty-seven, she still has to look after her other three daughters, the smallest of whom is just four years old. For the sake of that she is engaged in stock-raising. \r\n\r\nMainly, Gulzhan purchases calves and feeds and resells them. Her husband helps her after work. She started this business twenty-five years ago with just eight dollars. Now her monthly income is 150 dollars!\r\n\r\n\u201cCattle-breeding is not the most profitable business. It is not sitting in a clean office gazing into a monitor, doing accounts. Anyway by raising cattle, we\u2019ve been able to buy a house, furniture, home equipment and even pay for the marriage of our eldest daughter,\u201d says Gulzhan proudly. \r\n\r\nCurrently, Gulzhan needs a loan to increase her livestock population, fatten it up and resell it. In the near future she is going to have a new shed built and a hay-loft, as well as finishing the building of her house, buy her son a car and pay for another daughter\u2019s wedding. \r\n\r\nGulzhan has four partners: Nurzada, Baktijar, Dilbar and Dzhanatkul. Dzhanatkul works as a cook at a school lunch room. The rest are occupied with cattle-breeding. All the members need loans mainly to purchase more livestock, so that they can resell it later.\r\n\r\nNurzada inherited four sheep and one cow. Now she has ten sheep and two cows. She wants a shed to store fodder, after buying a car to get married.\r\n\r\nBaktijar started with buying sheep. Then he bought horned cattle. For the moment he has sheep, oxen and a horse.\r\n\r\nDilbar and her husband used to save money to buy cattle. Now the\u0443 have a cow, a calf and sheep. She wants to buy a car and pay for her son\u2019s marriage.\r\n\r\nYears ago Dzhanatkul bought a cow which provided seven liters of milk a day. Now she has three cows and gets twenty liters a day.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>======================================\r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---<\/b>\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance, a young and ambitious socially-focused MFI in Kyrgyzstan.\r\n\r\nMol Bulak Finance is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development on the basis of the 3-Ps concept - People (building human capital and taking care of its customers and the society as well), Profit (to be profitable in order to grow further) and the Planet (taking care of the environment).

She began this business on the recommendation of her parents and since then she has worked doing the feeding and cleaning at the farm.   During the morning she goes out to cut alfalfa which serves as forrage for the animals. Afterwards, she ends the day by cleaning out the sheds, where she extracts the excrement, using it as fertilizer for her plants. When the weekend comes, she goes out to sell her animals, and in this way she has been able to obtain good profit.  The goal that she has proposed is enlarging her farm.

Luego de que sale el producto lo acomoda en una paila de plastico y sale a venderlo de casa en casa y de negocio en negocio.

She has two daughters and five sons, and is married.  She lives in La Aldea de La Concepcion, in the municipality of Juticalpa. \r\n\r\nAlejandrina has been making and selling doughnuts and quesadillas for more than 15 years.  She learned this trade because she worked with a neighbor making the same products, and also learned thanks to several bakery courses she took at the Instituto Nacional de Formacion Profesional (INFOP). \r\n\r\nHer business is located in her home, and still has no name. Her work schedule starts at 4:00 am, and she works with her two daughters.  They help her to prepare the dough, and then spend the time it takes for the products to be in the oven.  Once she takes the product out of the oven, she places it in a plastic container, and takes it to sell door-to-door to homes and businesses.  She thinks that her major advantage is that her products have a special flavor, and that additionally she is a friendly person who gets on well with other people and this helps her to make sales.\r\n\r\nHer dream is to have premises in the town center, even if they are small, so that she no longer has to sell by foot and so can have an easier life, as she has diabetes and is still undergoing medical treatment.  Every time she returns to her home after finishing her daily work, she feels resentful of her health.\r\n\r\nThe loan that Alejandrina is requesting is needed by her to buy corn, cheese, sugar, butter and other ingredients to make doughnuts and quesadillas.  With the help of this loan, she will be able to generate earnings and cover her medical costs.  She will also help her husband with the financial upkeep of the household, as he works in agriculture and has little income.  She also would like to make improvements to her home.\r\n\r\nAlejandrina has had several years receiving support through FAMA through the provision of loans, which she has punctually paid back and which have helped her to keep her active business going and to improve her home."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":862398,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bakery","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy corn, cheese, sugar, butter, etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"Juticalpa, Olancho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15 -86.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":168,"posted_date":"2011-09-08T20:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":650,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alejandrina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-08-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":12000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1500},{"due_date":"2011-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1500},{"due_date":"2011-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":1500},{"due_date":"2011-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":1500},{"due_date":"2012-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":1500},{"due_date":"2012-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":1500},{"due_date":"2012-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1500},{"due_date":"2012-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":81.25,"local_amount":1500,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T08:51:46Z","rounded_local_amount":1530.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232784957},{"amount":81.25,"local_amount":1500,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T09:53:50Z","rounded_local_amount":1530.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238589354},{"amount":162.5,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-16T08:50:31Z","rounded_local_amount":3060.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244547449},{"amount":325,"local_amount":6000,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T09:52:50Z","rounded_local_amount":6121.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250758087}],"funded_date":"2011-09-11T20:52:32Z","paid_date":"2012-01-15T09:52:50Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Arabella Pollack","image":null}},{"id":336831,"name":"Las Hero\u00ednas De Labranza Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"\u00c9ste Banco comunal se llama \u201cLas Hero\u00ednas de Labranza\u201d, lo conforman 17 emprendedoras que se dedican a diferentes rubros entre los cuales se encuentran picadura de le\u00f1a, fruter\u00edas, verduler\u00edas, venta de ropa, venta de miel, ensaladas preparadas, venta de huevos y confecci\u00f3n de ropa.

will later sell in parts, going door to door. She has been doing this for 3 months and says that it's going well and that her household income has increased a little bit.\r\n\r\nShe started the business after her mother-in-law proposed it; she already has a business making bread and selling plastic goods, so she couldn't go from house to house. She gave the chickens to Silveria because she had children who could help her with the sales, and they are getting good results.\r\n\r\nWhat she wants most is to continue in this business and also making bread so that she can support her children in their education. \r\n\r\nThe other members of the group are: Angelina, who sells plastics and makes bread; and Everfein who buys and cells calves.

The group members are all neighbors from Yanahuapa, a small town about fifteen minutes outside of the city of Urubamba, in the Sacred Valley. Though this is Santa Rosa de Yanahuapa's first loan from Arariwa, many of the group members have previously participated in group loans, either through Arariwa or through other local financial institutions. \r\n\r\nAt the group's inauguration on March 26th, there was a warm, friendly atmosphere. After singing Peru's national anthem, the group members ate a celebratory inaugural meal of chicken, baked potatoes, corn and cheese in a spicy cilantro sauce, joking and laughing together all the while. The group's loan officer, Alfredo L\u00f3pez, told the group that the seed capital they are receiving now may seem like very little, but soon their investments will bear fruit, and that single seed will produce 200, 500, or even 1000 seeds. \r\n\r\nThe group members are involved in a variety of businesses: they work as artisans, raising livestock or small animals like guinea pigs, growing grains, vegetables and flowers, as grocery store owners, and making and selling chicha, a traditional Andean alcoholic drink made from fermented corn. \r\n\r\nThe group's president, Juan Gualberto A. G., teaches at the local school and also buys and sells cattle as an extra source of income. He currently has three Brown Swiss cows, and is feeding them so that he can sell them for a higher price. He plans to use his loan to buy seed to plant more grass for his cattle. This is Gualberto's first group loan, and he hopes to lead the group well in order to help its members get ahead in life and expand their businesses. \"This organization depends on all of us working well,\" he told the group. He reminded them that everyone must attend all of the group's meetings, make payments on time, be punctual and responsible, and show solidarity with the other group members. \r\n\r\nThe Santa Rosa de Yanahuapa group has agreed to work according to these principles and to repay their Kiva loan in full and on time. \r\n\r\nNote: Three people in the photo are not group members.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.<P>\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

Ten years ago she became interested in revenue-generating activities, in particular the retailing of firewood and smoked fish. She enjoys a solid reputation in what she does and receives many orders, mostly in winter.\r\n\r\nTo satisfy a demanding and ever-increasing customer base, she called upon Soro Yiriwaso. After five individual loans, all correctly reimbursed, she is now requesting her sixth loan, which will be used to buy five cartloads of firewood from villages in the vicinity of Sikasso, and five boxes of smoked fish from Gao (seventh administrative region of the Republic of Mali).\r\n\r\nShe sells the firewood from her home and retails the smoked fish at the market, for cash or credit to a diversified range of customers.\r\n\r\nShe hopes the loan will help her achieve monthly earnings of 115,000 FCFA, which will serve to cover personal and some family expenses, and pay off the loan. The remainder will be reinvested in the business.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Ren\u00e9 McConnell, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":507369,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"Buy firewood and smoked fish","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sikasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.316667 -5.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2010-03-17T14:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":650,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sitan ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-09T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":300000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2010-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2010-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2010-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2010-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2010-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2010-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2010-11-04T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2010-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":33333.36}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.22},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.22},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.23},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.22},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.22},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.22},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.23},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.22},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.22}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":72.22,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2010-04-08T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T12:15:00Z","rounded_local_amount":34619.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136746551},{"amount":72.22,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2010-05-08T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T10:03:15Z","rounded_local_amount":34619.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144779097},{"amount":72.23,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:16:50Z","rounded_local_amount":34619.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151961297},{"amount":72.22,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T12:01:33Z","rounded_local_amount":34619.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159699422},{"amount":72.22,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:58:13Z","rounded_local_amount":34619.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166913342},{"amount":72.22,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:41:01Z","rounded_local_amount":34619.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172180516},{"amount":72.23,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T16:14:30Z","rounded_local_amount":34619.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177476553},{"amount":72.22,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:40:10Z","rounded_local_amount":34619.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182613343},{"amount":72.22,"local_amount":33333.36,"processed_date":"2010-12-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T14:42:42Z","rounded_local_amount":34619.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188751827}],"funded_date":"2010-03-17T19:38:41Z","paid_date":"2011-01-15T14:42:42Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ren\u00e9 McConnell","image":467423}},{"id":189316,"name":"Mabatini Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Abdul M., age 32, is married with three children, ages 10, 8 and 5.

Her previous loan of P18,000 was used to fund operations of her general store and it had a positive impact on both the business and on the family\u2019s living conditions. Now she is borrowing P8,000 for her 13th loan which she intends to use for her general store.\r\n\r\nLeonida is working hard to achieve her dreams and aspirations for her family, which are to provide them with a brighter future and a more comfortable life.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b> About NWTF:<\/b>\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

","en":"Mar\u00eda, 43, lives in her own home with her two children.  Since her childhood she has embroidered creative designs on skirts that are typical of the area where she lives.  She works daily at home and on the weekends she sells her works of embroidery at the local markets in her area.  Her main customers are merchants who sell typical costumes and this is why she must advance daily with her production in order to produce higher quantities of items.\r\n\r\nFor her, having supplies on hand is key because then she can advance problem free.  Alongside this activity, she also raises pigs which she sells in her area markets after three months of fattening.  She states that she enjoys the embroidery work more because it doesn\u2019t require much physical exertion.  In addition, she feels that this work doesn\u2019t have any loss because the items aren\u2019t perishable like food.  She is taking advantage of the festive season in her area because orders are increased.\r\n\r\nThis is her 11th opportunity with MFP.  She is happy to know that she can count on financial help because she has always been responsible with her repayments.  Additionally, she enjoys being part of a communal bank because all the members are responsible and support each other.  Also, she is grateful to all the people that made the loan possible because it will be very useful for her business\u2019s progress.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda will use the funds to buy raw materials like thread and fabric in assorted colors and varieties that she needs for her embroidery because she is aware that she must capitalize on this season when orders increase.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":566625,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Embroidery","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"To buy raw materials.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"HUANCAYO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.066667 -75.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-07-13T18:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":725,"lender_count":27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-06-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":725}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":725,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T14:05:03Z","rounded_local_amount":2047.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188724891}],"funded_date":"2010-07-13T21:23:53Z","paid_date":"2011-01-15T14:05:03Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":217994,"name":"Emily","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Emily M. is from the village of Minante 2, Cauayan City, Isabela.

She is separated and lives alone in her own home.  15 years ago she decided to generate her own source of income by farming and raising animals.  She also has a store in which she sells a variety of basic goods.  Her daughter is in charge of that business.  Each morning she goes out into the fields to tend to her crops while her cow and her sheep graze on pasture.  She takes some of the crops she harvests to sell in other towns and sells some in her store.  During all the time she has been working, she has seen the fruit of her labor in the profits that she has made.  For this reason she is looking ahead to increase her production and intensify the sale of her animals.\r\n\r\nThis is the 9th loan which she has had from MFP.  She is very happy to know that she has financial support from MFP because they know she is a person who is responsible in making her repayments.  She likes being a member of her community bank because all the members are people who she knows.  They are all responsible and very supportive of each other.  She thanks all those who will help fund her loan since it will be very useful for her in making progress with her business.  She will use the loan to buy sacks of fertilizer for sowing her next lot of corn.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":637402,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy sacks of fertilizer","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"HUANCAYO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.066667 -75.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-11-11T15:50:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":300,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-10-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":800,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":800}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":300}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":300,"local_amount":800,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:33:39Z","rounded_local_amount":837.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206195710}],"funded_date":"2010-11-13T12:33:24Z","paid_date":"2011-05-15T11:33:39Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Oxnard","image":null}},{"id":250782,"name":"Joseph","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Joseph K.

about Tajikistan and IMON International\n\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

In addition, he likes working in the fields and the income he earns when he sells his crops which allows him to cover household expenses.  What he doesn\u2019t like, on the other hand, is the infestations that affect his crops; he must always be on the lookout for them and alert to any outbreak of them.

After several years spent at his sides, he finished by opening his studio. He has run this business for fifteen years. The strength of his sales is due to the genius of his products, known by all in S\u00e9gou. The difference between him and others is linked to his sense of creativity.\r\nHe enjoys a clientele composed of women and men.\r\nIn the intent of increasing his turnover, he is asking for this new loan. He has been in relation with Soro Yiriwaso for twelve months, after one individual loan correctly repaid. He is at his second individual loan, which he intends to use to purchase one sewing machine for thick wire. He stocks up in the area. Monsieur Bourama does his transactions in cash and sometimes on credit. With this loan he imagines making a monthly profit of 100,000FCFA. This profit will allow him to make his repayments to Soro Yiriwaso and to settle his operating expenses.

But the mill does not belong to him and he has to make a tally at the end of each day and make do with what is left over. With his experience in this matter, it has become clear that this could be a very profitable activity if the machine belonged to him. He therefore aspires to buying a mill for grating cassava, with which he will improve his income and his quality of life. To do this, he is asking for a loan of $1,200.\r\n<p>\r\n\r\nMonsieur D.

Especially remarkable are Senegal\u2019s networks of rotating savings and credit associations, known as tontines. Commonly organized by groups of twenty to thirty housewives who live in the same village, the tontines provide poor women throughout the country with small loans to finance modest income-generating activities. Repayment rates within these associations are excellent, because they are based on local reputation and personal trust between the members. However, their financial resources are limited to the contributions of their members, frequently subsistence farmers with very little disposable income. This has prevented the traditional tontines from meeting the demand for rural microenterprise loans and restricted their impact on the economic development of their communities. The SEM Fund works to bridge this gap by linking traditional village credit associations with outside sources of finance.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n\r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\nIMON's History\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Mislima is 45 year old. She is married and has two chidlren. She owns a specialized fabrics store at the central market in Dushanbe town. Mislima works in a sphere of trade where the demand is always very consistent and high, because the national dresses in Tajikistan are very popular and very important item of the dowry of any girl. She is one of the leading fabric vendors in the market where she works. She is very tenacious and determined in all of her business endeavors, which has helped to sustain her venture for 11 years. Mislima is a skilled entrepreneur. When she started this trade, she decided to implement basic concepts of integrity and hard work in her business to reach ultimate success. This laid a firm foundation for winning results and Mislima has obviously been a successful small entrepreneur. However, she doesn\u2019t want to stop. She would like to continue seeing her venture grow. Today she is requesting a loan of 4000 Somoni to increase her assorted inventory. With your help, Mislima will be able to make her business succeed and support her children with education.  \n\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\n\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Zoila has been working as a seamstress since she was 15.  She is now 63 years old.  Zoila is widowed and has five adult children.  She is currently caring for her two-year-old granddaughter Jimena.\r\n\r\nZoila has been working with Kiva partner Manuela Ramos for 2.5 years and is a member of the communal bank \"Nuevas Amigas\" (New Friends).  Zoila used her very first loan of 300 soles to invest in sewing materials and in the sale of cooked foods.  She will use this loan of 1000 soles for the same purpose: Zoila plans to buy fabrics and other materials for sewing and also basic food products for her other business, preparing and selling cooked food from her home in the evenings.  \r\n\r\nZoila's goal is to leave an excellent sewing workshop to her daughters Doris and Fiorella when she passes on.  Zoila is grateful to Manuela Ramos not only for the financial support but also for the educational sessions given by the organization's loan officers at her communal bank's monthly meetings.  Zoila feels that these sessions help her to learn a little more than what experience alone can teach her.

The country is home to epic mountain passes, a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC, and communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still lives in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Most of the villagers know each other very well which creates an environment of trust. Walking down the clean streets of San Andres one can see many people chatting and children playing. This is a typical village where people help each other out with their daily tasks. \r\nFortunately, this cultural factor is also reflected in Las Rosas\u00b4 organization. Some members of the group are better doing the paperwork and arrange the meetings, whereas others have more acquaintances that can help the younger ones of the group to sell their products to a bigger group of customers.\r\nThis is how Do\u00f1a Manuela C., who is one of oldest of the group, helps the younger members. She has a store in one of the main streets at which she sells traditional blouses. Do\u00f1a Manuela is very well known in the village because of her store. When a customer asks her about clothes she doesn't sell in her store, she refers them to group members like Ami. Ami is one of the younger members of the group. She also sells blouses, but from a different type, they are called croshet blouses, they have a very different look from the traditional ones.\r\nAlma G. is the president of the group. She has a sister in another group who enthusiastically told her about Friendship Bridge. Alma, formed a group with her friends and neighbours who, like her, mostly work in buying and selling clothes. \r\nThey all want to invest their credit in purchasing a more diverse repertoire of clothes. The other four women, who own a food store, also want to expand the diversity of products in order to capture more clients and increase their sales. \r\nLas Rosas want to keep working hard in order to keep building their new improved life. They wish to have a solid business so they don't have to leave their families behind in order to go and sell their goods at far away markets. That's why they try to communicate well to one another about their business ideas so they are not over-supply San Andres with the same goods, says Catalina. \r\n Las Rosas are doing a great job a working together and accomplishing unity within their trust bank, with your support they will keep working in this manner and accomplishing their dreams.

She is 41 years old and attended school until the 8th grade.  She is married and the mother of 5 children between the ages of 22 and 29.  Three of her children are in college, and the others are working.\r\n\r\nAfter finishing the 8th grade Ticana had to interrupt her studies due to the poor financial conditions of her parents.  She left Manhi\u00e7a for Marracuene with her husband who served as the Director of Agriculture in that district for 5 years.  Because she had a good level of schooling, Ticana was invited by the administrator to work as his secretary. Two years later her husband was transferred to work in Namaacha, a town on the border of Swaziland, so she abandoned her job.\r\n\r\nHaving arrived in Namaacha Ticana got a loan from her oldest sister and began her business of raising chickens with the help of her husband who is an expert agronomist; an activity that they continue today.  Besides being a great chicken farmer she is also owner of a food shack, but because the chicks require a lot of attention she does not have fixed hours of work.\r\n\r\nShe makes at a maximum 5X100 boxes of chickens at 35MT and resells each one for 85MT.  She raises them in phases to be able to sell alternatingly.  Her best product is a ready-prepared chicken that she sells from her stand.  She makes 4,000MT per month but is only able to save 500MT because she has to pay expenses for her children who are studying at the university, and her husband had problems in the service and lost his job.\r\n\r\nThis is Ticana's second loan with Hluvuku and her first with Kiva.  The first loan of 15,000MT was used to purchase chickens and she was able to repay without any difficulties.  She is requesting this second loan of 12,000MT to reinforce her business.  She is confidant that she can pay off the loan before maturity so she can ask for another loan to construct a wall around her residence.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Jared

He and his wife are monogamous and live with their children in the Torakabougou quarter in the city of Bougouni (in the 3rd administrative region in the Republic of Mali). Not having gone through the education system, he quickly began trying to make a living, namely daily work with masons, shepherding and other jobs in the countryside. None of these activities succeeded for him. Thus, he decided to take up the purchase and sale of various shop items. He took his first steps into the business with his older brother, a specialized merchant in general commerce. With five years\u2019 experience, Mr. Souleymane S. has well mastered the holding of, and resulting business from these various products, which are very sought after in Bougouni.

So when her parents who previously owned the farm supplies store she now operates decided to pass on the business to her, she had mixed feelings - excited because it had the potential of providing a steady income, enough to support her family, and at the same time she was doubtful that she could make a go of it, especially as she did not have the necessary working capital to buy stock for resale.\r\n\r\nSo when a friend told her about NWTF-Project Dungganon, she grabbed the opportunity to join and gain access to a credit line that she badly needed to make her business survive. She also admits that the discipline of paying back her loans made her realize the importance and value of good financial management.\r\n\r\nNow on her 12th cycle loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Anecita is borrowing PHP 10,000 to enable her to buy more stock for resale in her farm supplies shop.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the calling of not just of a few but thousands of women. Through the alleviation program, these women have progressed from earning less than $1\/day to realities beyond their dreams. They have learned to live a life where they can finally be called honorable.

trabajar para ayudar a su madre porque el papa muri\u00f3 en un accidente de tr\u00e1nsito en la cual ellos quedaron solos y la madre de Deisy es una persona ya mayor y ella tiene que hacerse cargo de su hermano como tambi\u00e9n de madre al ser la \u00fanica responsable de su familia y tratarle de ayudar  ella es una persona que le duele el haberlo dejado la escuela porque ella so\u00f1aba con estudiar  medicina para saber el porqu\u00e9 su hermano ten\u00eda ese problema la situaci\u00f3n en la cual se encuentra Deisy es muy triste porque ella tiene que ser la responsable de su hermano.\n\nElla solicita el cr\u00e9dito para la compra de soya para poder aumentar la producci\u00f3n de leche y la elaboraci\u00f3n de quesillo y teniendo m\u00e1s ingresos podr\u00e1 ofrecerle a su familia un mejor nivel de vida y seguir con el apoyo constante a su hermano y  tal vez en un futuro ella tiene la esperanza de terminar el colegio ella no sue\u00f1a con tener su propia familia porque no quiere que le lastimen a su hermano ella lo quiere mucho porque \u00e9l es un muchacho muy tierno y ayuda en la casa con las vacas y a veces se va a cortar alfa con su madre a quien quiere mucho y no la deja sola. \n","en":"Deisy is 27 years old.  She lives with her mother, Francisca L., and her brother, who has Down syndrome.  They live in Esquilan Chico to the south of the road to Quillacollo, which is a province in Cochabamba.\r\n\r\nDeisy is a hard-working girl, who devotes herself to milk production and making \u201cquesillo\u201d (soft cheese) with her mother.  She has worked since she was a girl.  She was contributing in order to help with her brother\u2019s education.  In our country it is ignored.  People with Down syndrome are rejected.  They are not offered the help they need to get ahead.  The help centers are in the city.  It is very far for Francisca to be able to take him there for help.  \r\n\r\nThat is the reason that Deisy had to leave school to be able to work to help her mother.  Her father died in a transit accident, and they were left alone.  Deisy\u2019s mother is elderly.  Deisy has to be in charge of her brother, like a mother, as she is the only responsible person in her family.  She tries to help him.  It hurts her to have left school because she dreamed of studying medicine in order to know why her brother has this problem.  Deisy is very sad to be in this situation because she has to be responsible for her brother.\r\n\r\nShe is requesting a loan to buy soy in order to be able to increase the milk production and the making of quesillo.  Having more income will allow her to offer her family a better standard of living and to keep up her constant support of her brother.  \r\n\r\nShe hopes that in the future she might be able to finish school.  She does not dream of having her own family because she does not want to hurt her brother.  She loves him a lot because he is a very affectionate boy.  He helps at home with the cows, and sometimes he goes to cut alfalfa with their mother.  He loves her a lot and does not leave her alone.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva
