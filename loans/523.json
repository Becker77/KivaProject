She has been farming almost all her life, but also ventured into the livestock business 16 years ago when she began selling excess milk produced by her cows to a local dairy. Her cows produce 60 liters of milk a day, which generates a lot of income. She also earns revenue from the sale of male calves. \r\n\r\nOccasionally, Eva's children help her with her livestock business and farm. They grow potato and maize, but mostly for the family's consumption. Most of the land is dedicated to the dairy business because it is more profitable.

organization that began operations in Bangladesh as a small-scale relief and rehabilitation project in 1972 to help the country overcome the devastation and trauma of the liberation war and focused on resettling refugees returning from India. Today, BRAC has emerged as an independent, virtually self-financed paradigm in sustainable human development. It is one of the largest Southern development organizations employing over 100,000 people, 61% of which are women, and working with the twin objectives of poverty alleviation and empowerment of the poor. Diagnosing poverty in human terms and recognizing its multifaceted nature, BRAC approaches poverty alleviation with a holistic approach.\r\n<br><br>The successes of BRAC in the international development arena have stimulated a series of discussions, both with African delegations, who have visited BRAC programs, and with donors who work in Asia and Africa. Both the African countries and the donors have encouraged BRAC to join the development campaign in Africa to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and more recently to join the campaign of \u201cending poverty\u201d, which is an area where Africa represents the greatest global challenge.\r\n<br><br> In Uganda, BRAC registered as a Non Government Organization (NGO) in January 2006 to undertake programs in Education, Health, Water & Sanitation, Agriculture & Livestock and Microfinance. The Microfinance and Education are the pioneer programs launched in Uganda and, as of July 2007, had served 21,273 borrowers and enrolled 1,155 adolescents in its education

Her sales are carried out in cash or on credit, of which she collects 50% within 45 days.\r\n\r\nHer dreams have mostly materialized in seeing her children become professionals, and work for themselves. Her biggest concern is of her daughter who is differently abled who will be left alone when she passes away.

This activity has made it possible for her to contribute to her family's income and satisfactorily meet the most urgent needs of her two small children. Every item of clothing Adolat produces is superior, and due to this her orders have markedly increased. She has some very large orders that would be impossible to fulfill if she didn't have an assistant. Her incredible energy, fortitude, and commitment to her clients drives her to offer them new and improved service. To this end, Adolat wants to speed up her dress production by purchasing more fabrics. To accomplish her objective, she is asking for a $500 USD loan to buy new modern fabrics and she promises to repay the loan in 12 months. With your help, you can make her dream come true.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New Western culture and Central Asian traditions. But Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

City, Negros Occidental. Her husband, Emmanuel, is a small sugar farmer. They have three young children who are between 4 and 9 years old. The older kids are presently attending elementary school.\r\n\r\nMerlita works hard to help her husband provide for their children\u2019s future because she does not want them to go through the same hardships she had while she was growing: needing to have a paying job just to help her parents support their family. Her most cherished dream is for her children to finish their studies and get a stable job or have an established livelihood.\r\n\r\nMerlita met her husband in Manila many years ago when she worked as a factory worker just to help her parents support their family. When they got married, they decided to go home to Negros where Emmanuel had a 1-hectare (2.5-acre) farmland that he could plant with sugarcane. Merlita had to adjust to living in a new place and she also realized that she needed to have her own source of income so that she could help her husband support their family.\r\n\r\nWhen Merlita gave birth to their oldest child, she decided to put up a general store adjacent to their house. She thought that this would serve two purposes: she could take care of her child and their household while selling basic goods to her neighbors and earn a supplemental income for their family. But in spite of her best efforts, she could not sustain the required inventory level that was needed and she sometimes did not have enough stock to sell. She almost decided to close down her store.\r\n\r\nIt was serendipity that a friend introduced Merlita to NWTF-Project Dungganon, and when she became a member in 2002, she was able to access the much-needed capital to support the capital requirements of her store. She was even able to expand her product offerings.\r\n\r\nAs her business grew, Merlita started selling rice to her neighbors, and also raised pigs in her backyard. Now she earns a minimum of PHP 10,000 per month from her business activities. She is currently saving money for the education of her children and also so that she can buy a motorcycle which they will use as another source of income.\r\n\r\nMerlita\u2019s previous loan of PHP 22,500 was utilized as revolving working capital for her businesses. Having paid that in due course, Merlita is borrowing PHP 25,000 this time around so that she can continue sustaining the capital requirements of her businesses. She hopes that all her efforts will bear fruit in the fulfillment of all her dreams.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b> About NWTF:<\/b>\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress out of earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":433721,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

She now earns an average monthly income of 8,400 Philippine pesos (PHP). \r\n\r\nDaisy is now borrowing 10,000 PHP so that she can purchase more stock to sell. This will be her fifth loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of 8,000 PHP, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Daisy aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means \"honorable\") way.\r\n\r\nThe accompanying photo of Daisy was taken after she attended the weekly NWTF-Project Dungganon Center Meeting that all group-based clients must attend. The meetings give each borrower the chance to share ideas with their group, learn new business skills and pay back their weekly installments.\r\n\r\n<b>About NWTF:<\/b> \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon.

This business emerged as a result of her divorce.  She had to work to support her two children.  That is how she started selling kebabs at the doorway of her house.  In time she became more well-known, and she started to have more customers. \r\n\r\nIn time her business was growing, she got greater income, and she started building her house.  Now she rents her house and continues selling kebobs and meals.  Dina tells us that everything she obtained was with much work and perseverance.  Her children were her motivation, and her desire to improve was bigger than her problems.  \r\n\r\nThanks to her effort and dedication she managed to improve her income.  Her children are now adults, and both of them have established a business making clothes.  Above all, she tells us that she has a better quality of life.\r\n\r\nIn order to continue growing she has requested a new loan to buy supplies, meat, and condiments.

Today, BRAC has emerged as an independent, virtually self-financed paradigm in sustainable human development. It is one of the largest Southern development organizations employing over 100,000 people, 61% of which are women, and working with the twin objectives of poverty alleviation and empowerment of the poor. Diagnosing poverty in human terms and recognizing its multifaceted nature, BRAC approaches poverty alleviation with a holistic approach.\r\n<br><br>The successes of BRAC in the international development arena have stimulated a series of discussions, both with African delegations, who have visited BRAC programs, and with donors who work in Asia and Africa. Both the African countries and the donors have encouraged BRAC to join the development campaign in Africa to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and more recently to join the campaign of \u201cending poverty\u201d, which is an area where Africa represents the greatest global challenge.\r\n<br><br> In Uganda, BRAC registered as a Non Government Organization (NGO) in January 2006 to undertake programs in Education, Health, Water & Sanitation, Agriculture & Livestock and Microfinance. The Microfinance and Education are the pioneer programs launched in Uganda and, as of July 2007, had served 21,273 borrowers and enrolled 1,155 adolescents in its education

is a 31 year old single mom with a four year old daughter who is just about to begin kindergarten.  She lives with her parents and brothers in order to save money.  She was in the third year in school on her way to an accounting degree when she had to drop out due to financial difficulties.  It is one of her dreams to one day go back to school to gain her degree. <p>\r\n\r\nWith nowhere else to turn, she got a job working with her father in a spare auto parts shop.  She didn\u2019t know anything about the business since she was being formally trained in accounting, and the years she worked with him were hard.  <p>\r\n\r\nEventually she picked up the trade and with her skills in numbers and accounting, she became a fine business woman.  She had herself and her daughter to support, and did not want to rely on her parents any longer.  Recently she decided to venture out on her own and begin her own shop in another area of Paraguay.  Both her parents and her brother felt is was a great idea and encouraged her.<p>\r\n\r\nNow it has been close to two years since she began her spare parts store and it has grown quite popular in the area.

She started this business with $100 as beginning capital. In 1995, she bought a stall at the market called Lufungula. With hard work and good management, Matane prospered in her business until 2006. She increased her working capital to $700.<p>\r\n\r\n From 2006 to 2007, her business decreased to $50 because of family difficulties due to rising rent costs and her husband\u2019s long absence in Angola, without any news of his welfare. After this, she joined one of Hope\u2019s groups in February 2007, and she reinforced her business by increasing the inventory. Currently, her working capital is $400 and she makes $100 per month as profit. Her ambition is to open a scrap metal store.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.<P>\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.<P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n<P>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

They live happily together and have a strong desire to get ahead, and in this respect they help each other. Martha produces bread and a variety of biscuits for a bakery which pays her for her services. She learned this trade by watching how the bakers work, and after a time she wanted to begin to produce on her own. She achieved this with great effort, and also a good memory; she mixed the ingredients and came up with shapes. She developed new styles of shapes of bread that today are displayed in the bakery where the customers are able to choose behind glass panels the most tempting breads that they wish to buy. Martha likes her job, and she obtains good earnings; in addition she has a small field where she grows potatoes. Her oldest daughter who works helps her economically, and the younger one helps with the household chores. The goal of the three is to succeed and to have their own bakery where they can offer the exquisite products that are created by their hardworking mother, who has managed to assume the role of father and mother without fear. This is the second loan that they have received from MFP, and they are committed to be responsible and punctual with every payment. In addition, they are content to work with their communal bank because they can work with enterprising women like themselves. The money that they are hoping to receive will be invested in the purchase of compost, fertilizer and potato seed to plant in large quantities to obtain increased earnings.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Lisa Grobar, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":425430,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy fertilizer for her potato fields","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-11-12T21:40:17Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":700,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Martha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-10-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2009-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2010-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2010-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2010-03-13T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2010-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2010-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2010-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2010-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2010-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":200}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":70,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2009-11-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:54:32Z","rounded_local_amount":200.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103843186},{"amount":140,"local_amount":400,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T21:06:24Z","rounded_local_amount":401.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734774},{"amount":70,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2010-02-11T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:48:54Z","rounded_local_amount":200.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123959839},{"amount":70,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2010-03-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:32:50Z","rounded_local_amount":200.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128992684},{"amount":70,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2010-04-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:37:20Z","rounded_local_amount":200.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136717467},{"amount":70,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2010-05-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:39:26Z","rounded_local_amount":200.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144751202},{"amount":70,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2010-06-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:02:35Z","rounded_local_amount":200.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151933755},{"amount":70,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2010-07-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:36:28Z","rounded_local_amount":200.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159672659},{"amount":70,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2010-08-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:39:15Z","rounded_local_amount":200.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166886525}],"funded_date":"2009-11-13T01:14:04Z","paid_date":"2010-09-15T10:39:15Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lisa Grobar","image":264298}},{"id":156324,"name":"H\u00e9l\u00e8ne","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"D.

She is starting a business venture, planting & harvesting taro for sale.    Malia needs a loan of WST $1,000 to purchase general farm supplies & equipment.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 300 talas or US $125 per week) to save as a reserve for future emergencies.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Malia joined SPBD to gain access to financial services.  Most of SPBD's clients are unable to borrow from commercial banks, because they lack collateral.  \r\n\r\nIn addition, SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"3 out of 3\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"2 out of 3\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"1 out of 3\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated. For more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nSPBD Social Metrics Scores for this Borrower:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                3 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              2 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         3 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              3 out of 3\r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.

She had experience in this area because she had helped her mother in a similar business before. \r\n<p>\r\nLiliana buys animals (pigs, fowl), fattens them and then she sells them in Lambayeque's city market or to the traders that occasionally visit her hamlet.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

This is work that she can easily undertake during the time available to her; she also helps her mother with the household chores, because her father works all day as a driver. \n \nLittle by little, Xiomara has learned the secrets of selling, and she currently does it with great enthusiasm, since she truly enjoys advising her friends in the area and other neighbors who are interested in her products in order to improve their image. \n\nHer desire for the future is to continue making progress with her business until she can open her own bazaar, where her products will be more effectively displayed and she can earn a better income. \n\nThis is her first loan with MFP, and she is committed to making all her payments in a very responsible manner.

She would like to be able to set up a restaurant in her home as she knows that this would make her more profits.\r\n\r\nOn this occasion, Esther requested a loan from Edaprospo so that she could continue investing in her food business, buying rice, sugar and mixed vegetables in larger quantities as this works out cheaper.  The 'El Progreso del Vallecito' community bank is a group of responsible people who are grateful for the loan that they are being given.

Las Brisas Communal Bank is based out of the house of Mrs. Cledy Sandoval. Alicia is 67 years old and single. She is a single mother with one grown son who works a a plumber. Until recently, Alicia had made her living selling popsicles, but she always dreamed of doing something more, and with her first loan she was able to leverage her working capital so quickly that she could soon afford a motorized vending cart. With her fierce drive to succeed, she rented out her cart and used the income to buy a washing machine and eventually, a freezer. Now she washes clothes and sells ice. With this next loan of 2,000 soles, which she will pay back in 4 months, Alicia will buy a new scooter which will help her to increase her sales. Alicia is very grateful for the help that Manuela Ramos has given her. Her life has improved remarkably and it makes her happy to see her hard work bear fruit. \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Sara Sultan, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":251454,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy a scooter","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Pucallpa-Ucayali","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":72,"posted_date":"2009-01-08T20:40:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":650,"lender_count":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alicia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-12-15T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2009-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2009-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2009-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":162.5},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":162.5},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":162.5},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":162.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":162.5,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2009-01-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T13:44:08Z","rounded_local_amount":502.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":10225210},{"amount":162.5,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2009-02-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T19:47:31Z","rounded_local_amount":502.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20417992},{"amount":162.5,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2009-03-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:13:48Z","rounded_local_amount":502.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27111444},{"amount":162.5,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2009-04-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:16:39Z","rounded_local_amount":502.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36006631}],"funded_date":"2009-01-09T01:41:15Z","paid_date":"2009-05-15T21:16:39Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sara Sultan","image":null}},{"id":86510,"name":"Man","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Man S., 32, lives in Kampong Cham province, Cambodia.

Doniyor has a flock of livestock consisting of approximately forty sheep and twenty goats.  His wife is a housewife, but in her free time, she works processing wool and knitting various warm things.  She sells these things to neighbors or relatives.  Every morning, Doniyor drives the flock to the mountains, grazes them, and drives them back in the evening.  Doniyor does not currently own any cattle, but Doniyor wants to buy two average bulls with this new loan.  After fattening them three to four months, he can sell them for very good price.  Doniyor is very happy to be working with us since the loans help him a great deal.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Russian by Melissa Kniazeva, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":306527,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"fattening and selling cattle","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Gafurov","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"40.217778 69.725","type":"point"}},"partner_id":47,"posted_date":"2009-04-23T17:00:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":650,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Doniyor","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-04-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":2500,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2009-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":1250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":325},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":325}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":325,"local_amount":1250,"processed_date":"2009-11-07T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-25T09:22:00Z","rounded_local_amount":1254.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103846229},{"amount":325,"local_amount":1250,"processed_date":"2009-12-07T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-10T08:42:16Z","rounded_local_amount":1254.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110737323}],"funded_date":"2009-04-23T23:59:45Z","paid_date":"2010-02-10T08:42:16Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Melissa Kniazeva","image":1694640}},{"id":106990,"name":"Adelaida","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La Sra.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is married to Maximiano S., who is also her business partner. She is the mother of their six children, five of whom are already working and are settled down with their own families, while the youngest is currently enrolled in college. By the grace of God, Basiliza has managed to support her youngest child's schooling up to the college level. At this time, she is working hard to continue sending her youngest to college. This is a dream for most Filipino parents like Basiliza, as she herself has been a college undergraduate and believes that a college diploma is the best inheritance parents could leave to their children.\r\n\r\nBasiliza operates a buy and sell business. What she basically does is buy general merchandise from wholesalers and sell them piecemeal with a little profit. Products can range from furniture to household appliances, electronic devices, clothing, electronic phone load, and other products of the like. Customers are attracted to buy due to the low selling prices and the many options they are offered. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of $5 to $7.50 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a 10,000 PHP loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy more quantities and varieties of products to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n \r\nBasiliza dreams to be able to give her youngest child a quality education through all her hard work on her business.

However, due to multiple years of drought as well as the effects of desertification, the circle of poverty has greatly increased and has thrown this population into precarious conditions. With the renewal of this loan, the goal will be to create new financial resources for community members who develop small inter-village businesses selling local products. The strategy rests upon the ability of the group to purchase and stock enough raw materials to create a working capital and to satisfy the demand of the weekly markets in the neighbouring rural communities.  They will have to purchase raw materials when the price is very low, stock the materials, then organise the redistribution of these materials throughout the year. Food products will be given priority in this business.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Allana Carlyle, Kiva

He works raising animals, which he sells once he has fattened and raised them for a while, and has done so for five years. In these years, he has had the satisfaction of working in a job that is not too heavy, caring for the animals by providing the vaccines and nutrition necessary for their growth. His small cows can bring additional income, as he sells the milk they produce in markets or to his neighbors. Alex wants to keep growing little by little, without rushing into hasty decisions. He wants to keep selling his own animals and milk, avoiding middlemen. This is his fifth loan with MFP, and thanks to the loans he's obtained, he's had the opportunity to grow considerably. For this, he is very grateful and maintains firmly his commitment to repayment. With this loan he will acquire a better breed of cow, valued at 1500 soles, which is why he requests a greater amount.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Trisha Bury, Kiva

Dolgormaa is 64 years old and lives with her grandson in Bayankhongor Province in central Mongolia. Her grandson is 16 years old and currently attends a local secondary school.\r\n\r\nDolgormaa operates a small meal service business out of her home. She prepares meals at her home and delivers them to her customers throughout her community. She started her meal service business in 2005 after retiring from a local school, where she taught for thirty-four years. Since then, her meal service has become popular in her community and she has many regular customers. She attributes her success to her good communication skills and honest, hardworking nature.\r\n\r\nFor Dolgormaa, family always comes first.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Thai T. has two hectares of farmland where she and her husband want to plant potatoes to make extra income but don\u2019t have the capital to do so. Because she doesn't have money, Thai T. decided to request a loan to buy farm supplies for her field. Additionally, she hopes to enlarge her grocery business with any remaining cash from the loan.  \n\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":567697,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy farm supplies and to enlarge her grocery business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KH","country":"Cambodia","town":"Kampong Cham","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12 105.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":106,"posted_date":"2010-08-02T10:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1100,"lender_count":38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Thai","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-06-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1100,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":92},{"due_date":"2010-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":92},{"due_date":"2010-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":92},{"due_date":"2010-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":92},{"due_date":"2010-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":92},{"due_date":"2010-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":92},{"due_date":"2011-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":92},{"due_date":"2011-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":92},{"due_date":"2011-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":92},{"due_date":"2011-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":92},{"due_date":"2011-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":92},{"due_date":"2011-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":88}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":92},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":92},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":92},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":92},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":88}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":184,"local_amount":184,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:26:02Z","rounded_local_amount":184,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166869300},{"amount":92,"local_amount":92,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-16T08:56:17Z","rounded_local_amount":92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172272905},{"amount":92,"local_amount":92,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T14:40:42Z","rounded_local_amount":92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177430234},{"amount":92,"local_amount":92,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-16T11:46:22Z","rounded_local_amount":92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182853295},{"amount":92,"local_amount":92,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-19T09:56:21Z","rounded_local_amount":92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":189160106},{"amount":92,"local_amount":92,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T23:50:59Z","rounded_local_amount":92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191575906},{"amount":92,"local_amount":92,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:52:20Z","rounded_local_amount":92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195863681},{"amount":364,"local_amount":364,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-17T08:15:57Z","rounded_local_amount":364,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201561607}],"funded_date":"2010-08-08T23:35:51Z","paid_date":"2011-04-17T08:15:57Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Hilary Hannon","image":null}},{"id":218478,"name":"Teresita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Teresita F. is from Barangay Bone South in Aritao Nueva Vizcaya.

Smoked fish are in high demand in Koutiala.\r\n\r\nIn order to bolster his working capital and strengthen his selling power, he decided to join the microfinance institution Soro Yiriwaso nearly a year ago. This is his second individual loan with the MFI; the first one was repaid without incident. \r\n\r\nWith this loan, Mr. Adama plans to buy five baskets of smoked fish in Korientz\u00e9 (in the Mopti region) from fishermen of Bozo and Somon\u00f4 ethnic backgrounds. He conducts his sales at retail at the fish market of Koutiala for cash or credit. His clientele consists of both men and women.\r\n\r\nMr. Adama expects to earn 120,000 FCFA per month, which he will use to repay the loan to Soro Yiriwaso and pay for family expenses. Any remainder will be reinvested in his activity.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":842434,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish Selling","sector":"Food","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"to buy smoked fish for resale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Koutiala","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:15Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Adama ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-07-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":250000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2011-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2011-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2011-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2011-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2012-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":41666.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.66},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.66},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":183.33,"local_amount":83333.34,"processed_date":"2011-09-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T10:13:34Z","rounded_local_amount":83927.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232882127},{"amount":91.67,"local_amount":41666.67,"processed_date":"2011-10-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T11:23:21Z","rounded_local_amount":41963.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238699221},{"amount":91.67,"local_amount":41666.67,"processed_date":"2011-11-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T11:12:41Z","rounded_local_amount":41963.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244655488},{"amount":91.66,"local_amount":41666.67,"processed_date":"2011-12-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T11:22:58Z","rounded_local_amount":41963.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250874282},{"amount":91.67,"local_amount":41666.65,"processed_date":"2012-01-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:48:20Z","rounded_local_amount":41963.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257283108}],"funded_date":"2011-09-03T13:40:57Z","paid_date":"2012-02-15T11:48:20Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":329128,"name":"Mata De Palma 3 & 5 Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Carmen is one of the members from the group Mata D.

After almost six years with her business, she has expanded her little butcher shop into a bigger one, with more quantity of meats to supply more clients. With this loan she will increase her inventory and make even bigger sales. She will use the profits to invest in her butcher shop. She is planning to make some changes in the structure. \r\n\r\nShe dreams of having a nice house and a successful business with employees. Carmen and her group thank all of you for your support.

Switching to clothing sales allowed her to improve financially and have a better quality of life for her and her family of two children.<P>\r\nAll the progress made by this courageous woman is thanks to Ceprodel which has offered her financial support for a year and a half now, having authorized a total of 7 loans which have helped her to increase her business, stocking better quality of clothing. In this way, Mrs. Carmen makes a living with dignity, and supports her two children who are more precious to her than anything else in her life.\r\n\r\n<p><b>Translated from Spanish by Eliana Colunga, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nEl negocio de venta de ropa para de todo tipo es un negocio muy dif\u00edcil de mantener por el hecho de que hoy en d\u00eda la competencia se arrecia y cada vez existen nuevos competidores en este mercado.

Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":205015,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"To buy more inventory.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mwanza","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.516667 32.9","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-10-23T22:00:26Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Edith","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-11-07T02:32:40Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":400000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2009-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2009-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2009-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2009-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2009-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2009-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2009-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2009-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2009-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":40000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":35,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2008-12-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:07:52Z","rounded_local_amount":40582.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9970572},{"amount":35,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2009-01-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:12:37Z","rounded_local_amount":40582.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14886789},{"amount":35,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2009-02-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:01:49Z","rounded_local_amount":40582.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20436049},{"amount":35,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2009-03-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:54:09Z","rounded_local_amount":40582.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130322},{"amount":34.99,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2009-04-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:22:48Z","rounded_local_amount":40582.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027151},{"amount":35,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2009-05-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:12:34Z","rounded_local_amount":40582.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613191},{"amount":35,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2009-06-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:00:40Z","rounded_local_amount":40582.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010274},{"amount":35.01,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2009-07-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:37:37Z","rounded_local_amount":40582.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63232585},{"amount":35,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2009-08-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:51:43Z","rounded_local_amount":40582.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73664401},{"amount":35,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2009-09-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T02:44:33Z","rounded_local_amount":40582.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87105199}],"funded_date":"2008-10-24T01:32:40Z","paid_date":"2009-10-16T02:44:33Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Barbara Standley","image":834286}},{"id":70158,"name":"Sok","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sok H. lives with her husband and their four children, three of whom are students, in Kampong Cham.

He has been a farmer for the past 5 years, with the goal of supporting his household and satisfying the needs of his children. For Abdulvahob, agriculture is an activity that he likes to do. Vegetable production is what he enjoys the most as it is easier to cultivate these plants, and the produce, when harvested annually, is profitable. The earnings are greater when buyers purchase the production in large quantities reducing the expense of transporting the produce. There is also saving in transportation when buyers come to harvest and take the produce away themselves. \r\n\r\nThis is Abdulvahob second loan with IMON International, and to date he has had no problems with his payments and all have been punctual. Abdulvahob wishes to invest the money in seeds, fertilizer, fuels and lubricants. \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and with it\u2019s famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Along with that, he tends to his calves, taking them to feed in the mornings. His work demonstrates his dedication to his cows, since one way or another they help solve his household expenses. Early in the morning, his wife milks them and sells the milk at nearby places. \r\n\r\nMost recently, Nazirjon wants to invest in purchasing another cow so that his wife can take more milk to the cities to sell, helping his business to continue growing economically. He is requesting a loan of 7,500 Somoni for this purpose.  \r\n\r\n<b>More about Tajikistan and IMON International<\/b>\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes being a key post along the Silk Road, and for the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition.

He has been partnered with Placida for 20 years and they have 4 children who they have raised in a house that they own near Santo Domingo. Jose has operated a farming business for 20 years. He grows potatoes, peas, maize, beans and a variety of vegatables, all of which he carefully tends with help from his family. He is very careful to plant his crops at exactly the right time, neither too early nor too late, because otherwise it becomes difficult to get rid of the weeds that grow along with the crop.  He says that the farm is profitable and earns enough to support his family, so he has no plans to leave it.  However, he does have another source of income, buying and selling pineapples.  He travels to the city of Santa Ana where he stocks up on pineapples and then carries the merchandise to the capital for sale.  He earns one Peruvian sol for each of the 600 or 700 boxes that he sells.  Now he's looking at another business.  He wants to set up a store in his house where he can sell everyday commodities.  There aren't any similar shops in his community so he thinks it will be a good business.  Jose belongs to the Santo Domingo de Tapo community bank and this is his second MFP loan.  His fellow members are confident that he will repay the loan on time.  Jose will use the loan for his pineapple business.  He expects to spend S\/.800 soles per week."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":764712,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Comprar cajas de pi\u00f1a.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-05-07T16:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jose ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-04-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":550}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":550,"local_amount":1500,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:56:48Z","rounded_local_amount":1552.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238666080}],"funded_date":"2011-05-16T19:58:06Z","paid_date":"2011-11-15T10:56:48Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jere Wiseman","image":30736}},{"id":300455,"name":"Glenda","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Glenda is 31 years old and married with five school-aged children.
