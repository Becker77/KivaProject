The profit that he makes from this business he spends to provide for his family\u2019s needs. \n\nIn addition to his transportation business he also processes dried fruits. Najmiddin would like to get a loan of 10,000 TJS for purchasing of new car in order to expand his business and make a good profit. \n\nThis loan will be his second loan from IMON International and he has a good credit history.\n\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International:\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes having been a key post along the Silk Road and having witnessed the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to epic mountain passes, a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC, and communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still lives in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History:\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is a sociable and hard-working woman who lives in her own home together with her partner, 38-year-old Ra\u00fal, and her two beloved children: 12-year-old Frank and 9-year-old Fiorella, who are the motivation behind all her hard work.\r\n\r\nThe produce which Virginia and her partner have managed to grow through their hard work and determination have helped them a lot in making progress in life.  Every morning, Virginia starts working on her land as she knows that the quality of her produce depends on the care she provides to her cacao, coffee, annatto and coca leaf crops.  During harvest seasons she needs the support of laborers who help her to pick and transport her harvested crops.  What she most enjoys about her work is caring for her crops and she feels very happy when she sees them grow big.  She has been in this business for five years and she considers the most difficult part of her work to be transporting her harvested crops to the storage warehouses in the town of San Francisco where she sells them and receives a good price for them.  In the future, she would like to buy more land.\r\n\r\nThis will be Virginia's second loan and she feels very happy to know that she will once more have your support as this makes her certain that she will continue to do well in her business.  For her part, she is prepared to make her repayments punctually, according to the repayment schedule.

Meet Joseph, who was born in the outskirts of Kitale, Kenya, and is said to have entered the world smiling. Life for Joseph and others in his rural farming village was challenging, requiring families to rely on ingenuity and perseverance in the face of few resources.He has a side hustle business(motorbike business). Joseph lives together with his wife, to whom he has been married for over 18 years! His marriage has been blessed with three children. Joseph has been doing mixed-farming for over ten years. He considers himself to be more passionate and hardworking than other farmers. He also leaves nothing to chance when carrying out his duties. Joseph is seeking a KES 50,000 loan to purchase farm equipment. Acquisition of these assets is aligned to his plan of growing his agribusiness to the next level. On his farm, he grows maize and also keeps dairy cows. He also keeps poultry. For the past few years, his biggest challenge has been the tools used on the farm. They are outdated and worn out, to say the least. As a result, farm work has become strenuous and time consuming. He spends more resources on labor, since working with these tools requires a lot of effort, yet the quality of work keeps deteriorating. Joseph is going to use this loan to purchase modern farm equipment that will bring effectiveness and efficiency to his farm work. New improved tools will not only save him on labor costs, but will also improve the quality of the work.

Her dreams are to own another home where she and her husband can live tranquilly, given their age. They are dependent on their business as their means of survival. Her wishes are to dominate in the business. Moreover, she likes the business and would like to maintain it well. She would also like God to give her more time so she can continue working and enjoying life.\r\n\r\nHer source of income is her general store, which is located in her house. She has had this business for 15 years. Calixtra began this business with the objective of helping out with the expenses of the family. This is how she helps her husband, as her husband no longer works due to his age. They began establishing the business with some products like candies, drinks, and basic grains. However, her customers were looking for more products, in which Calixtra had no capital to invest. Later, she decided to take out a loan and managed to get more products for her general store and satisfy the needs of her customers.

Sonia and her husband strategically located their business by the bus stop where the majority of bus lines complete their route, so as to provide the drivers with easy access to their services.  For the future, Sonia and her husband see the possibility of adding the sale of spare auto parts to their vulcanizing business.  This is the second time that she has had a loan with MFP, and she works incessantly so that she and each member of her communal bank may succeed and continue to receive loans.  The money that she asks for now will be used to improve the infrastructure of her business site and to supply herself with more adequate tools for use in her work.   \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Kevin Lenhart, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":305434,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Auto Repair","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"Mejorar la infraestructura de su local","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"HUANCAYO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.066667 -75.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-04-20T21:20:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":650,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sonia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-03-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":130.33},{"due_date":"2009-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":133.34},{"due_date":"2009-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":142.19},{"due_date":"2009-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":148.6},{"due_date":"2009-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":153.07},{"due_date":"2009-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":160.19},{"due_date":"2009-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":169.37},{"due_date":"2009-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":175.53},{"due_date":"2009-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":184.9},{"due_date":"2010-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":191.38},{"due_date":"2010-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":201.83},{"due_date":"2010-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":209.27}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.36},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.34},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.21},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.3},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.75},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.06},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.05},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.05},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.09},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.2},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.59},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":42.35,"local_amount":130.33,"processed_date":"2009-04-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:49:59Z","rounded_local_amount":131.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36012458},{"amount":43.34,"local_amount":133.34,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T00:58:23Z","rounded_local_amount":134.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44596048},{"amount":46.21,"local_amount":142.19,"processed_date":"2009-06-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:43:47Z","rounded_local_amount":143.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52990312},{"amount":48.31,"local_amount":148.6,"processed_date":"2009-07-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:45:30Z","rounded_local_amount":149.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63211435},{"amount":49.75,"local_amount":153.07,"processed_date":"2009-08-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:27:53Z","rounded_local_amount":154.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73640946},{"amount":52.06,"local_amount":160.19,"processed_date":"2009-09-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:39:59Z","rounded_local_amount":161.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87080414},{"amount":55.05,"local_amount":169.37,"processed_date":"2009-10-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:15:31Z","rounded_local_amount":170.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96996593},{"amount":57.05,"local_amount":175.53,"processed_date":"2009-11-24T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:56:00Z","rounded_local_amount":177.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103842111},{"amount":255.88,"local_amount":787.38,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T21:07:24Z","rounded_local_amount":794.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110733787}],"funded_date":"2009-04-21T03:17:00Z","paid_date":"2010-01-15T21:07:24Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kevin Lenhart","image":null}},{"id":106650,"name":"Sean","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sean N. is 56 years old and resides in the Kampong Cham province.

Most of the members are involved in different commercial activities such as selling breakfast foods, clothing, handicrafts or CDs, or providing public transport for passengers.  Although competition within the commercial sector is always present, over the years the members have learned to hold their own by selling good quality products at low prices, or by diversifying their merchandise so they can have a more varied stock; this has enabled them to generate more income for supporting their families.  Nevertheless, the members always need to increase their working capital in order for their businesses to grow, since their families\u2019 needs are increasing over the years.  The members need economic assistance so that they can increase their merchandise and purchase tools and spare parts, and thus improve their daily income.

Sin embargo, varias veces al a\u00f1o el camino se vuelve intransitable por las lluvias que azotan la zona. Este es sin duda uno de los principales desaf\u00edos para la comunidad. \n\nCuando no exist\u00edan actividades muchas personas optaron por salir a buscar trabajos en Turrialba o en fincas bananeras ubicadas en la Zona Atl\u00e1ntica de Costa Rica. Actualmente los precios del caf\u00e9 y la leche han mejorado, por lo tanto los vecinos buscan c\u00f3mo invertir en proyectos en la misma zona y de esta forma evitar migrar.\n\nActualmente do\u00f1a Carmen orde\u00f1a a en una peque\u00f1a instalaci\u00f3n de madera que acondicion\u00f3 como sala de orde\u00f1o. Dice que por d\u00eda logra producir aproximadamente 30 litros de leche y con otra vaca su producci\u00f3n aumentar\u00e1 muchos m\u00e1s litros diarios por lo cual esta muy emocionada de poder ver como su negocio crece y se fortalece.\nDo\u00f1a Carmen desea obtener un microcr\u00e9dito por \u00a2500.000(quinientos mil colones) para comprar otra vaca y as\u00ed aumentar la producci\u00f3n de leche. Ella sabe que contar con otra  vaca es un mayor sacrificio y demandar\u00e1 m\u00e1s trabajo pero dice que si quiere sacar a su familia adelante tiene que esforzarse en producir m\u00e1s.\n\nDo\u00f1a Carmen es socia de la Asociaci\u00f3n de Productores de El Sauce, una de las 100 organizaciones socias de EDESA en Costa Rica. Este ser\u00e1 su octavo pr\u00e9stamo y con \u00e9l espera continuar creciendo a nivel personal y econ\u00f3mico. Tambi\u00e9n destaca que gracias a este tipo de organizaciones y medios facilitadores de cr\u00e9dito puede dedicar m\u00e1s tiempo a las actividades productivas. \n","en":"Carmen R. P., 39, lives with her husband and their three children in the El Sauce de Santa Teresita de Turrialba community in the Cartago province.  It is a small, rural community with approximately 2,000 inhabitants.  The inhabitants work at milk production and planting coffee.  The landscape is irregular, and much of the land is humid tropical rain forest.  The community has very picturesque scenery that combines tropical rain forest with two lovely lakes, coffee plantations, and dairy farms.  El Sauce is approximately one and a half hours by bus from Turrialba, which is the closest commercial center.  Several times a year, however, the road becomes impassable because of the rains that fall in the area. This is without a doubt one of the biggest challenges for the community.\r\n\r\nWhen there isn't any work, many people choose to look for jobs in Turrialba or on banana plantations located in the Atlantic region of Costa Rica. Currently the prices of coffee and milk have improved, so the local people are looking to invest in projects in their own areas so they don\u2019t have to travel to find work.\r\n\r\nCarmen currently milks in a small wooden installation set up as the milking room.  She says that she produces approximately 30 liters of milk a day.  With another cow, her production will increase by many more liters daily.  She is excited to be able to see how her business grows and becomes stronger.\r\n\r\nCarment wishes to get a micro loan for \u00a2500,000 (five hundred thousand colones) to buy another cow and increase her milk production.  She knows that having another cow is a big sacrifice and will demand more work.  But, she says that if she wants to get the family ahead she needs to put forth great effort to produce more.\r\n\r\nCarmen is a member of the Association of Producers in El Sauce, one of the 100 member organizations of EDESA in Costa Rica.  This will be her eighth loan, and she expects to continue growing on a personal level and economically.  She also points out that thanks to this kind of organization that serve as a means of facilitating loans she can dedicate more time to productive activities.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from

She found out about Hluvuku through a friend who is already a client of this institution.  This is her 1st loan, which has a value of 16,000 MZN.   She intends to use it to buy construction material (paint, sand, cement, stone, doors, etc.) in order to expand and improve her house.\r\n\r\nShe promises to pay back this loan on time so she can have access to others.  In the future, she plans to ask for more loans in order to finish her house and offer her family a more comfortable place to live.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br

Estrella is requesting a new loan of 7,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase raw ingredients needed to make products for sale. This loan will be the second loan taken out by Estrella from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines.

She operates her store from a building on property she and her husband owns. Khairu has requested a loan of $1,300 USD to make some improvements to her store. She\u2019d like to purchase some shelving material and buy a scale to use for weighing food items. These investments will help Khairu as she continues to develop and expand her business. She hopes to use her profits to pay off her children\u2019s college tuition. In the future, she would also like to do some remodeling to her store so that she can increase her retail space. This is Khairu\u2019s third loan from IMON International. We are happy for another opportunity to assist her in developing a successful business. \r\n \r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She would pay for it upfront and sell to a few customers on credit so they could pay her easily. She sold towels, sheets, ornaments, and cosmetics. Later, in a locale in the center of  Barranquilla, she decided she would sell only the cosmetic line. This didn't meet her expectations, so finally she went to a wholesale dealer of household appliances and they decided to sell both things in the same locale. Elizabeth sells the small appliances and he, the wholesaler, sells the large appliances with a sublet because she pays for the space.  Her Kiva loan is the third loan Elizabeth  has had with the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo. With it, she will buy irons, blenders, and cell pones as well as USB memory sticks. She wants to take advantage of the high demand these items have had and the easy turnover. With her previous loans from this organization, she has been able to increase her working capital and more than anything serve her customers. That is why she is grateful to the Foundation for its financial support. With it, she has been able to supply her business with a variety of items. Her dream and great challenge is to have alternate points of sales in other commercial centers so she can increase her income and continue with her spouse, plannig their family growth. While this is happening, Elizabeth is working persistently on her business, able to support herself in the market with sales profits of no less than 21%, which she plans on increasing gradually. \r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":782752,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy irons, blenders, cell phones and USB  memory sticks  ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2011-06-06T00:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1100,"lender_count":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elizabeth ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":2000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":149713},{"due_date":"2011-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":154431},{"due_date":"2011-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":157005},{"due_date":"2011-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":159621},{"due_date":"2011-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":162282},{"due_date":"2011-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":164987},{"due_date":"2012-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":167736},{"due_date":"2012-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":170532},{"due_date":"2012-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":173374},{"due_date":"2012-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":176264},{"due_date":"2012-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":179201},{"due_date":"2012-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":184854}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.34},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.94},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.35},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.79},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":89.26},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":90.74},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":92.26},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.79},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.35},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.95},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":98.56},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":101.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":82.34,"local_amount":149713,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:49:31Z","rounded_local_amount":149862.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221673798},{"amount":84.94,"local_amount":154431,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-17T08:02:00Z","rounded_local_amount":154585.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227320355},{"amount":174.14,"local_amount":316626,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T10:20:59Z","rounded_local_amount":316942.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257188261},{"amount":758.58,"local_amount":1379230,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T16:07:50Z","rounded_local_amount":1380609.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283140352}],"funded_date":"2011-06-06T05:26:05Z","paid_date":"2012-06-15T16:07:50Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ellen Donohue","image":541577}},{"id":308276,"name":"Mar\u00eda Leonor","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Salir adelante con su negocio y apoyar financieramente a su esposo debido a los problemas de salud que \u00e9l actualmente enfrenta, es el sue\u00f1o de Mar\u00eda Leonor, quien a sus 58 a\u00f1os de edad tiene la esperanza de mejorar su calidad de vida.

The distribution of farming inputs is part of One Acre Fund\u2019s integrated agriculture package, which includes training, reliable input supply (such as fertilizer and seeds), credit and insurance.\r\n\r\nWith income from her maize sales, Rose will educate her children.\r\n\r\nIn 2012, the members of Ovuluhya SHG group will each plant between \u00bd and 1 acre of maize.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":875,"image":{"id":934063,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To source farming inputs, such as seeds and fertilizer, at low prices for the 2012 planting season.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Webuye","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.616667 34.766667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2011-12-01T03:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":875,"lender_count":32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rose","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sarah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maruti","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Martin","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Joseph","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Joan","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Francis","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Florence","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Evans","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Anne","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-12-02T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":78050,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":875,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78050}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":875}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":875,"local_amount":78050,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-27T10:17:37Z","rounded_local_amount":78968.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315681182}],"funded_date":"2011-12-21T00:29:16Z","paid_date":"2012-11-27T10:17:37Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":369776,"name":"Mercy","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mercy is married to a carpenter and has two children.

That's why since she was 30 years old, she has been selling clothing.  Years ago, she had a small stand, but she could not make enough to cover the rent.  Because of the difficult situation facing her family, she decided to sell her garments door to door and in markets.   Little by little, she began to sell her items at the local fairs.   Now things are picking up and she would like to establish herself in a commercial location so her knitted pieces, designed entirely by her, will be better displayed and appreciated.   HIlda has big goals that motivate her.  She is requesting a loan to invest in her business.  She appreciates your great support. <\/p>\r\n\r\nLos problemas y la escasez econ\u00f3mica nunca derrotaron a Hilda que siempre ha buscado la manera de acabar con los obst\u00e1culos para salir adelante y es por ello que desde hace treinta a\u00f1os  se viene dedicando al comercio de prendas de vestir.En a\u00f1os anteriores ten\u00eda un local comercial pero el alquiler no compensaba las ganancias que percib\u00eda, es debido a esto   que decidi\u00f3 vender sus art\u00edculos de manera ambulante por la dif\u00edcil situaci\u00f3n  que afrontaba su familia y poco a poco  inici\u00f3 comercializando sus prendas  en las ferias locales de su zona.Hasta ahora est\u00e1 bien y piensa establecerse en un local comercial para que sus art\u00edculos tejidos y dise\u00f1adas enteramente por ella sean tambi\u00e9n apreciados en este espacio.

from Dar es Salaam, Tanzania! This is 50-year-old Hilda M..  She is married and has three children with ages between 20 and 26.<p> In 2005, Hilda established her pharmacy business. Hilda has already received and successfully repaid one loan from SELFINA, and now requires a new loan in order to purchase additional medicine. In the future, Hilda plans to to increase the quantity and range of the stock.. She thanks you for your support. <P>SELFINA is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility, as a practical way to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women.<P>SELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing.

1945 and lives in the Utanskoya mountains in a rural kishlak (village). He has eight children.  Two of his sons have gone to work in Russia, but their wives remain.  M. provides for his family and his daughters-in-law, even though his sons send money to live off of.  The primary occupation in the village is farming.  M. works in farming as well, but at the end of autumn, he is unemployed.  Because of this, every family, including M.\u2019s, raises livestock, since livestock provide both food and warmth.   He keeps cows for milk and other dairy products, and he has a lot of goats and sheep who give wool.  In the winter when livestock is cheap, he buys goats or sheep. However, this time he did not have enough money to increase his herds. His relatives advised him to go to MicroInvest, since they themselves had taken out loans in the past.

Because of their lack of experience, the business failed.  Although it was very sad, they didn\u2019t lose their enthusiasm and started another business selling cleaning products.  It wasn\u2019t easy to start this business because they had to overcome many obstacles including finding customers.  It was difficult to become known, but despite these problems they succeeded and today  feel very proud and happy to see the success of their business.\n\nMrs. Segunda labels, wraps and sells the cleaning products.  It\u2019s amazing to realize that they have been working for 30 years in this business and have been able to educate their children.  One of them is a teacher and another will become a chef.  This fills them with happiness. They have also been able to finish the first floor of their house. In the near future they are looking at the possibility of opening a store in their house so that they can sell the products directly to the public.  Currently they only sell to the customers that they know.  Both of them realize that their profits will increase and they would like to make their own products. And why not have their own brand?  Mrs. Segunda is very grateful to EDAPROSPO because with their loans, their business has expanded little by little.

Jose is a U.S. Army veteran.  He has been operating Twin Rivers Construction off-and-on since 1995, when he finished his first active duty stint with the U.S. Army.  Jose ran Twin Rivers Construction, in addition to having other jobs, for six years until he was recalled to active duty following the September 11th attacks.\r\n\r\nAfter retiring from the U.S. Army in 2005, Jose got a job driving a truck, only to find his veteran\u2019s disabilities prevented him from meeting the job\u2019s physical requirements.  Jose returned to his construction part-time job while he studied to be a pharmacy technician through the G.I. Bill.  After graduating and being unable to find work in his new specialty, Jose continued his construction business full-time.\r\n\r\nAn El Paso native, Jose learned to work with his hands as a small child when he would help his father with projects around the house.  He says he likes construction because he likes putting things together.  Though Jose originally intended Twin Rivers to be a commercial construction company, he moved to residential construction because he could be paid faster for his work.  Jose has one employee, who is also a military veteran and is Jose\u2019s neighbor.  \r\n\r\nJose heard of ACCION Texas-Louisiana through the Veteran\u2019s Administration.  He is using this loan to better advertise his business, as well as have a cushion for operating expenses.  He has made new business cards and wants to start advertising his business through local media outlets.  Until now, Jose has relied on word-of-mouth advertising to generate business.  He uses a referral system that rewards his clients for recommending him.  He hopes his new commercial advertising efforts will grow his business to better sustain himself and his employee.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":5525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":5525,"image":{"id":726763,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Construction","sector":"Construction","themes":null,"use":"Advertisement,

She is 25 years old. Elsie is married. Elsie owns and operates a specialized retail store. The main source of income for the business comes from buying and selling health & medicinal or supplementary products in the local community. Elsie has been engaged in her business for over three years and earns approximately 5,000 Philippine pesos (PHP) a month from it. \r\n\r\nIn 2010, Elsie joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to do business. Elsie has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional inventory & working capital. Elsie is requesting a new loan of 8,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional supplementary products to sell. This loan will be the second loan taken out by Elsie from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand it. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao. \r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Cusco is known for being a very touristy, commercial zone as well as for its traditional \u201cInti Raymi\u201d festival and also because one of the Seven Wonders of the World, Machupicchu, is located here.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":872822,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy manure and 'olluco' [a tuber] seeds.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Raqchi - San Pedro - Canchis - Cusco","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":119,"posted_date":"2011-09-20T18:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Tiburcia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-09-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":226.59},{"due_date":"2011-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":235.59},{"due_date":"2011-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":244.93},{"due_date":"2012-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":254.64},{"due_date":"2012-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":264.74},{"due_date":"2012-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":273.51}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.08},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":86.39},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":89.8},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":93.37},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.07},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100.29}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":83.08,"local_amount":226.59,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T09:27:47Z","rounded_local_amount":226.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238552260},{"amount":86.39,"local_amount":235.59,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:20:55Z","rounded_local_amount":235.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244511067},{"amount":89.8,"local_amount":244.93,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T09:24:55Z","rounded_local_amount":245.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250718518},{"amount":93.37,"local_amount":254.64,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T09:36:55Z","rounded_local_amount":254.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257121067},{"amount":97.07,"local_amount":264.74,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T08:38:32Z","rounded_local_amount":265.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263246068},{"amount":100.29,"local_amount":273.51,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T08:33:45Z","rounded_local_amount":273.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":269971026}],"funded_date":"2011-09-22T14:25:54Z","paid_date":"2012-04-15T08:33:45Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":341094,"name":"Omar","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Omar is a married man with four children, all of whom attend school.

She then makes a mixture of dough out of the milled wet corn and leaves it for a day.\r\n\r\nShe divides the risen dough into two. She mixes one part with water to make a porridge-like consistency form cooks it until it is firm, but not fully cooked. She mixes the rest of the uncooked dough with the half-cooked dough.

She is therefore requesting this second loan in order to respond better to the expectations of her customers. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":193154,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish Selling","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To buy 3 drums of vegetable oil, 10 piles of firewood, and a half sack of charcoal","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BJ","country":"Benin","town":"Cotonou Agence principale","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"9.5 2.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":104,"posted_date":"2008-08-27T05:45:47Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Christine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-09-10T17:45:55Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":140000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":12727.27},{"due_date":"2008-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":12727.27},{"due_date":"2008-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":12727.27},{"due_date":"2009-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":12727.27},{"due_date":"2009-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":12727.27},{"due_date":"2009-03-10T07:00:00Z","amount":12727.27},{"due_date":"2009-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":12727.27},{"due_date":"2009-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":12727.27},{"due_date":"2009-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":12727.27},{"due_date":"2009-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":12727.27},{"due_date":"2009-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":12727.3}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":29.55},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":29.55},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":29.55},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":29.55},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":29.55},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":29.55},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.55},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.55},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.55},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.55},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":30,"local_amount":12923.08,"processed_date":"2008-10-10T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-30T07:06:02Z","rounded_local_amount":13320.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":354083},{"amount":29.09,"local_amount":12531.46,"processed_date":"2008-11-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-15T18:44:26Z","rounded_local_amount":12916.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5284538},{"amount":29.55,"local_amount":12727.27,"processed_date":"2008-12-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-15T10:20:52Z","rounded_local_amount":13118.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9897459},{"amount":29.55,"local_amount":12727.27,"processed_date":"2009-01-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T09:36:17Z","rounded_local_amount":13118.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14821399},{"amount":29.55,"local_amount":12727.27,"processed_date":"2009-02-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-15T08:36:31Z","rounded_local_amount":13118.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20357662},{"amount":29.55,"local_amount":12727.27,"processed_date":"2009-03-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T09:29:48Z","rounded_local_amount":13118.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27046715},{"amount":29.54,"local_amount":12727.27,"processed_date":"2009-04-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T10:16:58Z","rounded_local_amount":13118.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35938338},{"amount":29.55,"local_amount":12727.27,"processed_date":"2009-05-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T20:47:16Z","rounded_local_amount":13118.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44396026},{"amount":29.55,"local_amount":12727.27,"processed_date":"2009-06-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T17:06:05Z","rounded_local_amount":13118.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52903898},{"amount":29.57,"local_amount":12727.27,"processed_date":"2009-07-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T10:24:15Z","rounded_local_amount":13118.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63125915},{"amount":29.5,"local_amount":12727.3,"processed_date":"2009-08-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T10:48:57Z","rounded_local_amount":13118.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73549403}],"funded_date":"2008-08-27T17:45:55Z","paid_date":"2009-09-15T10:48:57Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Daniel Kuey","image":669418}},{"id":65710,"name":"Appia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mambo from Dar es Salaam, Tanzania!

The organization is devoted to the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through microfinance as a practical way to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets; thus, they are deemed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and hence poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":875,"image":{"id":204254,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Office Supplies","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To buy new equipment for a stationery business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Dar es Salaam","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-6.8 39.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-09-20T03:30:21Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":875,"lender_count":32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Appia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-10-04T07:27:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":1000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":875,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2008-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2008-11-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T04:19:17Z","rounded_local_amount":100756.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5347987},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2008-12-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:06:47Z","rounded_local_amount":100756.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9970561},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-01-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:12:02Z","rounded_local_amount":100756.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14886778},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-02-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:01:31Z","rounded_local_amount":100756.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20436038},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-03-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:53:42Z","rounded_local_amount":100756.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130311},{"amount":87.49,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-04-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:22:19Z","rounded_local_amount":100756.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027142},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-05-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:12:03Z","rounded_local_amount":100756.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613182},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-06-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:00:15Z","rounded_local_amount":100756.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010265},{"amount":87.51,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-07-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:37:25Z","rounded_local_amount":100756.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63232576},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-08-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:51:21Z","rounded_local_amount":100756.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73664392}],"funded_date":"2008-09-20T07:27:00Z","paid_date":"2009-09-15T21:51:21Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jason Groce","image":null}},{"id":69818,"name":"Sup","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sup S., 54, is married and lives with his wife in Battambong, Cambodia.

Ever since he was a child, he felt an affinity for cars, so since he was very young he learned to drive in cars of his friends and family and was able to get his drivers license and since then he has tirelessly worked in this job, feeling very happy because he is able to obtain the income necessary to pay for his family's expenses. However, as in any job, his has some downsides. In his case, the car with which he usually works has some sporadic problems, which hurt his job and daily income. Fortunately, Jhony has been able to deal with all kinds of problems, working very hard at his job which is very profitable thanks to his efforts, since he goes out to work at 6 in the morning and returns at 11 at night.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>But Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>IMON's History<\/p>\r\n<p>Since December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 500 talas or US $208 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nMalia joined SPBD.  This is her 5th loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Malia's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Malia E. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.3 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.6 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              1.3 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

Joel has been engaged in his business for over 15 years and earns approximately 15000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Joel joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Joel has successfully repaid a previous loan of 25000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional seeds, seedlings & young crops to raise. Joel is requesting a new loan of 30000 PHP which will be used to purchase fertilizers such as manure. This loan will be the seventh loan taken out by Joel from ASKI. He plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand the borrower's business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines.

She faithfully meets with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week.\r\n\r\n-Jeepneys have purely American origins. They were first used by American soldiers helping the Philippines throw off the invading Japanese. Filipino ingenuity, however, managed to see this vehicle as an opportunity to earn, and modified the Jeep into a 20-seater \"jeepney\", open enough to provide adequate ventilation, sturdy for everyday travel, and cheap enough to buy and maintain. Now, the jeepneys are one of the things that makes the Philippines truly the Philippines.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay Micro Finance

Komang Suarmi realizes that there should be more amounts deployed, so that goods sold can be more in number and varieties, but it was all they had.\r\n\r\nTo improve her grocery store that will help her husband who is only a farmer in fulfilling their daily needs, Komang propose to earn loan from DINARI through Tempek Program. Komang will use the 12 months loan with monthly installment to increase the number and the variety of goods sold, especially the variety of seasonings and kitchen materials. Komang is sure that the more variety her grocery store provides, the more customer will shop, and the more she will earn.\r\n\r\nKomang is able to earn Rp 300,000 a month from the store. The income is really usefull, especially to help her husband to fulfill their family daily needs and to fund their child\u2019s tuition fee, as well as to raise their toddler.

She owns a art business venture.  Tina has many years of experience in this business.  Tina needs a loan of WST $1700.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 500 talas or US $208 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nTina joined SPBD.This is her 4th loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Tina's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Tina S. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              2 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         2 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

S. is 41 and married with 8 children.  She owns a business venture, selling ice-cakes (flavored ice in styrofoam cups).  Afiafiese has 4 years of experience in this business.  Afiafiese needs a loan of WST $2450 to buy sugar, styrofoam cups, and codial (flavoring).  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 500 talas or US $208 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\n\nAfiafi wishes to keep her business development on going as she requests for another fund to support and assist her family financially.  Afiafiese joined SPBD.  This is her 5th loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Afiafiese's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\n\nAbout SPBD\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\n\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists, and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

She is married to a trader and has four children, aged 25, 18,15 and 10 years respectively; all are school-going children. She has one additional dependent, who lives with her because she is a foster child.   \r\n\r\nIn 1991, Fatmata established her cola-nuts, palm oil, pepper and groundnut business. She began her business because she was unprivileged to attend school and her father forced her into early marriage at the age of 15 years to a businessman. They did business together for some years but later her husband gave her some money to establish her own business, which has grown over the years from a stall to a shop.  \r\n\r\nWorking seven days a week and 11 hours a day, she earns about 1,066,000 Sierra Leone leones (Le) every month from this business. She would like a loan in the amount of Le 5,000,000.   \r\n\r\nFatmata has already received and successfully repaid four loans, and now requires a new loan in order to purchase the following items: Cola-nuts - 10 bags @ Le400,00; and palm oil - 8 rubbers @ Le90,000. The balance will be used to pay laborers.  \r\n\r\nShe hopes that this loan will enable her to increase her monthly profits by approximately Le 160,000. In the future, Fatmata plans to build another house and have her own store. She also plans to provide a quality education for her children.  \r\n\r\nShe feels good in taking this loan as it will help her to earn more income. Her major challenge is that sometimes she can buy some items with a high cost from her suppliers but when she goes to sell them, there will be a fall in prices. Competition is high, but she overcomes her competitors by selling at a reduced cost. She serves 10 customers each day.   \r\n\r\nHer business is popular because she is honest and sells at a reduce price. Her suppliers are located in Bo Town and Sanda. She transports her supplies by public vehicle, and she buys three times per month. She adds her profit to the business. She is planning to expand her business and this will be accomplished by acquiring loans. She thanks you for your support.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1225,"image":{"id":926463,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food","sector":"Food","themes":["Conflict Zones"],"use":"to purchase the following items: cola-nuts - 10 bags @ Le400,00; and palm oil - 8 rubbers @ Le90,000.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SL","country":"Sierra Leone","town":"Makeni","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"8.883333 -12.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":148,"posted_date":"2011-12-13T21:30:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1225,"lender_count":38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Fatmata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-11-10T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"SLL","disbursal_amount":5000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":1225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":500000},{"due_date":"2012-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":500000},{"due_date":"2012-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":500000},{"due_date":"2012-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":500000},{"due_date":"2012-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":500000},{"due_date":"2012-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":500000},{"due_date":"2012-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":500000},{"due_date":"2012-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":500000},{"due_date":"2012-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":500000},{"due_date":"2012-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":500000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":122.5},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":122.5},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":122.5},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":122.5},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":122.5},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":122.5},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":122.5},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":122.5},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":122.5},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":122.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":122.5,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T09:29:24Z","rounded_local_amount":508375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250721827},{"amount":122.5,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T09:40:24Z","rounded_local_amount":508375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257124735},{"amount":122.5,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-16T07:49:18Z","rounded_local_amount":508375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263505641},{"amount":122.5,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T08:38:18Z","rounded_local_amount":508375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":269974747},{"amount":122.5,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-16T08:13:57Z","rounded_local_amount":508375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276815315},{"amount":122.5,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-16T08:04:34Z","rounded_local_amount":508375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283444372},{"amount":122.5,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-16T08:01:57Z","rounded_local_amount":508375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287537104},{"amount":122.5,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T08:56:17Z","rounded_local_amount":508375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294284595},{"amount":122.5,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:14:23Z","rounded_local_amount":508375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301338187},{"amount":122.5,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T08:49:35Z","rounded_local_amount":508375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308354598}],"funded_date":"2011-12-14T01:55:44Z","paid_date":"2012-10-16T08:49:35Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Michelle Archer","image":162079}},{"id":365727,"name":"Sugran's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sugran (right) is 49, married, and lives with her family including five children.

They live in extended traditional families in the Dougoukoro neighborhood in the city of Yanfolila (one of the prefectures of the third administrative region of the Republic of Mali).\r\nThey are linked by bonds of neighborhood and friendship. This groups specializes in selling Wax pagne (a highly prized cloth in Africa) and cereals. They've been partnering with the Soro Yiriwaso institution for two years now and are seeking their fourth solidarity loan (group loan). All previous loans have been repaid without problems. This loan will enable them to buy 40 pieces of Wax pagne from wholesalers in Bamako, as well as 100 kg of cereals from itinerant merchants coming from the surrounding villages.\r\nThe pagnes are then cut into \"trois pagnes\" (\"three pagnes\", i.e. the amount of fabric needed to make some woman outfits) and retailed for cash in the market and in the various neighborhoods in Yanfolila. The business results in a profit of XOF 1250 (ca US$ 2.40) per piece. The cereals are retailed to a mostly female clientele, for cash and on credit.\r\nThe members of the Benkadi group hope to make, each in their speciality, a monthly profit of XOF 50'000 (ca US$ 100) that thy intend to use to repay the loan and help their husbands in providing for the family. The women of this group have the ambition to open cereals shops to broaden their clientele.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Patrick Stadelmann, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2050,"image":{"id":224515,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"To buy Wax pagnes (highly prized cloth) and cereals","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Yanfolila","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.183333 -8.15","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2008-12-01T08:00:14Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2050,"lender_count":64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mai","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mamou    ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mari\u00e9tou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Noukessa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fanta         ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sali ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fanta Badjan ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-10-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":1050000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":2050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":175000},{"due_date":"2008-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":175000},{"due_date":"2009-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":175000},{"due_date":"2009-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":175000},{"due_date":"2009-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":175000},{"due_date":"2009-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":175000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":341.67},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":341.67},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":341.67},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":341.67},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":341.67},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":341.65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":683.33,"local_amount":350000,"processed_date":"2008-12-21T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:35:25Z","rounded_local_amount":352608.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9974096},{"amount":341.67,"local_amount":175000,"processed_date":"2009-01-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:29:09Z","rounded_local_amount":176304.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14889469},{"amount":341.67,"local_amount":175000,"processed_date":"2009-02-19T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:14:11Z","rounded_local_amount":176304.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20440262},{"amount":341.67,"local_amount":175000,"processed_date":"2009-03-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T22:11:19Z","rounded_local_amount":176304.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27135630},{"amount":341.66,"local_amount":175000,"processed_date":"2009-04-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:33:41Z","rounded_local_amount":176304.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36033431}],"funded_date":"2008-12-17T14:32:09Z","paid_date":"2009-05-15T23:33:41Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Patrick Stadelmann","image":1374498}},{"id":78042,"name":"Maria Leonor","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Leonor B., tiene una venta de tortillas, ella tambi\u00e9n vende c\u00f3males para caber tortillas, y los vende en diferentes lugares, tambi\u00e9n se dedica a la venta ropa t\u00edpica  de mujer.

Though the decision she made then allowed her see the happiness that life can offer, she doesn't like to be dependent on anyone, even on her new partner, Anastacio, who is a brother of her former husband, because she knows that she has children of her own to raise and send to school.<P>\r\n\r\nHer membership in ASHI and the loans she has accessed since she became a member have assisted her in running a  business while Anastacio is a laborer and farmer. He is also very supportive of Zenia and his step-children, as well as their own nine-year-old child. Because of this, Zenia has been performing very well in her repayment, attendance, and business thus making her qualified for a higher loan amount.<P>\r\n\r\nZenia's recently received loan was intended as additional capital for her farming (rice planting) business and hog fattening (backyard pig raising) with pigs to be sold after four months. She will also finance her store to be re-opened. Zenia has to have many business to generate bigger income to send all six of her children to school. All in all she has seven children, however, her eldest works as an overseas contract worker and is also helping her finance the education of the siblings.

She lives with her two children in a house she owns.\r\n\r\nFor 2 years, she has made a living selling prepared meals at one of the best-known markets in her neighborhood.  She is an excellent cook and serves up a variety of tasty dishes.  She works from very early in the morning until everyone finishes their lunch at 2 or 3 in the afternoon.  She then goes home to her household chores.  Rogelia is happy with her business because she likes to cook.  She doesn't think it's an easy job, though, because she has to be very careful about how she prepares her dishes and, at times, the rush of customers is more than she can handle.  For the future, she wants to improve her food stand and buy better tables so that her customers will be more comfortable and able to talk to each other more easily.  \r\n\r\nThis is Rogelia's second MFP loan and she was very careful before to repay all the installments on time.

She lives with her husband, their two children, two grandchildren and the wife of one of their sons in Alajuelita, a region located in Costa Rica\u00b4s central valley. Angelita is an experienced client of Fundaci\u00f3n Mujer. Over the past 16 years, she has received numerous loans in various amounts to finance her sales business. Angelita plans to use the current loan to purchase clothes, shoes and perfumes, which she will sell to her clients in different parts of Costa Rica. The majority of her clients are women, though she offers products for men as well. Angelita does not drive; her main method of transportation is the public bus system.  \r\n\r\nIn the mornings, Angelita performs domestic tasks such as cooking, cleaning and overall house maintenance. After lunch, she heads out to either purchase new products, collect on repayments from clients she has sold to on credit or to sell her products. Twice per month, Angelita travels 3 hours by bus to an area named Guapiles to visit her clients. \r\n\r\nAngelita says that the apartment her family lives in is small for seven people.  At the moment, she is saving as much as she can so that one day, she might be able to buy a house in Alajuelita.  Angelita says her main problem is collecting money from some of her clients. She says she has to remind some of them that her products are \u00a8not a gift.\u00a8\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":515303,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To purchase clothing, shoes and perfumes.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CR","country":"Costa Rica","town":"Alajuelita","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"10 -84","type":"point"}},"partner_id":151,"posted_date":"2010-03-27T03:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Angelita ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"CRC","disbursal_amount":300000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":17,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":16933.27},{"due_date":"2010-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":17328.38},{"due_date":"2010-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":17732.71},{"due_date":"2010-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":18146.47},{"due_date":"2010-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":18569.89},{"due_date":"2010-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":19003.19},{"due_date":"2010-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":19446.59},{"due_date":"2010-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":19900.35},{"due_date":"2010-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":20364.69},{"due_date":"2011-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":20839.87},{"due_date":"2011-02-26T08:00:00Z","amount":21326.13},{"due_date":"2011-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":21823.74},{"due_date":"2011-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":22332.96},{"due_date":"2011-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":22854.06},{"due_date":"2011-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":23397.7}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.04},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.77},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.51},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.27},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.05},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.84},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.65},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.48},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.34},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.2},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.1},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.01},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.95},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.89},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.9}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":62.94,"local_amount":34328.38,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:33:07Z","rounded_local_amount":35288.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136678112},{"amount":69,"local_amount":37636.02,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-16T07:40:32Z","rounded_local_amount":38688.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":152047945},{"amount":418.06,"local_amount":228035.6,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-16T08:45:32Z","rounded_local_amount":234415.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159763254}],"funded_date":"2010-04-01T00:20:43Z","paid_date":"2010-08-16T08:45:32Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":193605,"name":"Dionisia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Dionisia K. is from the village of Del Pilar.

His wife is a trader, and all of their children attend school.  In 2000, Farrah established a furniture-making business.  He began his business at age 15, after his father died.  Without his father, there was no sponsorship for his schooling and because of this, Farrah's uncle advised his mother to send him to study at a carpentry workshop.\r\n\r\nNow Farrah makes beds, chairs, cupboards, dressing mirror, tables, benches, desks, and other items.  He works six days a week, 11 hours a day, and earns about Le 1,500,000 every month from his business. Farrah has already received and successfully repaid one loan, and plans to use the proceeds of this loan to buy raw materials to make beds, tables, and chairs.  Farrah says a major business challege for him is that some customers will not pay in full for items they order, leaving unpaid balances that are difficult to collect.

Margaret is the facilitator of the Vumilia Self Help group.

She joined One Acre Fund in order to access fertilizer and hybrid seeds and ensure food security for her family. In the recent 2011 season, Margaret had a very good maize yield, harvesting 17 bags on 1 acre of land. Before joining One Acre Fund, Margaret was only able to harvest 4 bags of maize on 1 acre of land.\r\n\r\nWith this loan, One Acre Fund will purchase fertilizer, seeds, and other important inputs to distribute to Margaret  and her group during Kenya\u2019s next planting season in February 2012. The distribution of farming inputs is part of One Acre Fund\u2019s integrated agriculture package, which includes training, reliable input supply (such as fertilizer and seeds), credit and insurance.\r\n\r\nWith income from maize sales, Margaret will educate her children and invest in livestock rearing.\r\n\r\nIn 2012, the members of Vumilia Self Help group will each plant  between \u00bd and 1 acre of maize.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1025,"image":{"id":934154,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To source farming inputs, such as seeds and fertilizer, at low prices for the 2012 planting season.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Webuye","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.616667 34.766667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2011-12-03T02:30:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1025,"lender_count":37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alice","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Judith","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Daudi","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Japheth","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"John","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Josphat","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Margaret","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mariam","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Perebetwa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Phoebe","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-12-02T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":90300,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90300}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1025}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":1025,"local_amount":90300,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-27T10:17:41Z","rounded_local_amount":91378.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315681194}],"funded_date":"2011-12-20T23:16:35Z","paid_date":"2012-11-27T10:17:41Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}}]}
