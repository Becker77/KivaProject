Safarof lives in the village Abdurahmon Jomi.

He purchases young bulls, feeds them intensively for 40-45 days, and resells at higher prices as those bulls cost more and are used later on for meat. After that, he purchases new bulls and repeats the process - that is how his business works. This business helps him to maintain his family, since this is a single main source of income for Asomiddin's whole family. Apart from that, development of these types of businesses help to supply markets with good meat at moderate prices.

It has produced famous thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. A civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged an already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural productivity and the manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b><br>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent viable business prospects. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is 49 years old and lives with her husband and one of her 5 children in the Mocape settlement, Olmos district, in Lambayeque province.  Mocape is about 2 hours from the City of Chiclayo.\r\n<p>\r\nFor the last 27 years she has dedicated herself to raising and selling farm animals.  Her husband acquires the animals from venders in the zone.  She is in charge of raising them and her husband sells them every Friday in the city of Chiclayo.  Usually they sell ewes, goats and hogs.  This is the only stable income that the family can count on.\r\n<p>\r\nShe wants to expand the family business by buying more animals to raise and sell.  For this reason she is soliciting a loan of 1,000 new sols through Edpyme Alternativa.  Mar\u00eda is a happy woman, hard working and very responsible.  In the photograph she appears in a pasture with the ewes she is raising.  In this zone it is very common to see ewes grazing freely.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Harold Sims, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":425667,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"TO BUY ANIMALS TO RAISE AND SELL","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Mocape - Olmos - Lambayeque","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":143,"posted_date":"2009-11-13T16:00:13Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Am\u00e9rica","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-10-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.91},{"due_date":"2010-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":68.17},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":76.28},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":78.58},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.64},{"due_date":"2010-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":80.58},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.14},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.29},{"due_date":"2010-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":89.3},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92.99},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96},{"due_date":"2010-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":98.12}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":24.12},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.86},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.7},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.52},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.21},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.8},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.55},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.55},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.6},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.34}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":24.12,"local_amount":68.91,"processed_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T12:48:03Z","rounded_local_amount":69.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110669606},{"amount":23.86,"local_amount":68.17,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:16:12Z","rounded_local_amount":68.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118065108},{"amount":26.7,"local_amount":76.28,"processed_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T09:47:05Z","rounded_local_amount":76.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123900212},{"amount":27.5,"local_amount":78.58,"processed_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T08:45:22Z","rounded_local_amount":78.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128934355},{"amount":27.52,"local_amount":78.64,"processed_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:08:45Z","rounded_local_amount":79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136661983},{"amount":28.21,"local_amount":80.58,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:07:15Z","rounded_local_amount":80.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144694694},{"amount":29.8,"local_amount":85.14,"processed_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:38:07Z","rounded_local_amount":85.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151877758},{"amount":30.55,"local_amount":87.29,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T10:50:58Z","rounded_local_amount":87.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159617808},{"amount":31.25,"local_amount":89.3,"processed_date":"2010-08-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:01:29Z","rounded_local_amount":89.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166832219},{"amount":32.55,"local_amount":92.99,"processed_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T09:56:23Z","rounded_local_amount":93.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172098844},{"amount":67.94,"local_amount":194.12,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-16T10:43:25Z","rounded_local_amount":194.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177554325}],"funded_date":"2009-11-17T16:39:32Z","paid_date":"2010-11-16T10:43:25Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Harold Sims","image":602722}},{"id":156468,"name":"Abu","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Abu J. sells used clothes in Makeni city.

four years.  She is currently a member of the Umi\u00f1a Communal Bank in Manta, which is Ecuador's first tuna fishing port on the Pacific coast.\r\n\r\nShe works selling fruit, plants, and clothing.  Perhaps this seems like a strange combination, but this is how she and her husband earn a living.  For seven years, they have run their business in Tarqui, a parish of Manta with a large business presence in the area.  She began the business with money she had saved up, but she needed more capital because her sales were increasing, and she had to stock her store.  At that time, a friend advised her to become a member of the communal bank, and since then the loans have worked well for her, and she has been expanding her business.\r\n\r\nLuisa will invest her new loan mainly in clothing and use the rest to stock her fruit business.  She and her husband work together in a place her in-laws gave them.  Luisa's husband was the one who began the business, and later on Luisa invested in clothing sales because her sister, who lives in the United States, sent her clothing, shoes, bags and costume jewelry.\r\n\r\nLuisa and her husband have been married for ten years.  Then have been unable to have children, but they have learned to deal with that and now are dedicated to their business.  Luisa's dream is to have a boutique in order to make her customers more comfortable.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Danielle Maxson, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":534017,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"Purchase and resale of assorted clothing","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Manta","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2010-05-06T03:50:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":675,"lender_count":26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Luisa Solanda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-04-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":660,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":82.5},{"due_date":"2010-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":82.5},{"due_date":"2010-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":82.5},{"due_date":"2010-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":82.5},{"due_date":"2010-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":82.5},{"due_date":"2010-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":82.5},{"due_date":"2010-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":82.5},{"due_date":"2010-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":82.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.38},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.37},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.38},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.37},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.38},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.37},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.38},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.37}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":168.75,"local_amount":165,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:17:10Z","rounded_local_amount":168.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144709125},{"amount":168.75,"local_amount":165,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:47:02Z","rounded_local_amount":168.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151892424},{"amount":168.75,"local_amount":165,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:10:21Z","rounded_local_amount":168.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159632784},{"amount":168.75,"local_amount":165,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:15:17Z","rounded_local_amount":168.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166846818}],"funded_date":"2010-05-15T14:56:45Z","paid_date":"2010-09-15T10:15:17Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":202204,"name":"Celedonia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Celedonia, D. 36 a\u00f1os, es una mujer muy trabajadora y responsable, vive en su casa propia junto a sus 5 queridos hijos, quienes son el motivo principal D. todos sus esfuerzos.

The community is located within the tropical Peruvian jungle.  In the past Gilberto worked raising coffee, where he received a fair salary, but after some time he decided to stop working for someone else and started his own business.  Since then he\u2019s been raising and selling coffee and cacao.  Things have been going well for him, so he feels happy with his work.  He gets some help from his family, but during the harvest season he hires workers to help with the harvest.  He plans to continue farming and needs to buy more farmland so that he can increase his production.\r\n\r\nThis will be his sixth loan through MFP and he is committed to making all of his payments.  He also feels empowered by his communal group because it provides him with many benefits.

It is located in the district of Jos\u00e9 Leonardo Ortiz, which belongs to Chiclayo province.  This district is characterized by its people working in wholesale and retail commerce, and in operating public transport vehicles.\r\n\r\nWalter has been working for some years driving his car as a taxi to different places in the Chiclayo city and beyond.  When he provides this service to other places, he can charge a little more for the convenience.

Generally, a loan manager evaluates a variety of social metrics on a scale out of 3 (the higher the number, the better off the person is) and these are averaged for the \"\"overall social metric score.\"\"  For example, a 3 out of 3 on \"\"level of education\"\" would mean that the borrower has graduated from university.  \r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.

She would like to improve her quality of life so that she can continue to support family. In spite of her age she has an excellent client base.

Esperanza would very much like to get ahead with her business, even though it is small, because keeping it active is the opportunity of a lifetime. \r\n\r\nEsperanza has owned a local store for 16 years, located in her home. Esperanza was prompted to start the store when her husband died. His death left her with a number of expenses, as well as the responsibility for providing for her family. In 1996 she approached the Fundaci\u00f3n Le\u00f3n 2000 and became part of the loan recipients program, with the objective of improving her quality of life. Esperanza had already demonstrated the qualities of a micro-entrepreneur, with her well-defined vision and the desire to manage a line of credit. Esperanza overcame a number of difficult circumstances in establishing her store, including the hard work for someone of her age and starting with very few products. Esperanza opened the store with only: basic grains, ice, and sweets. In spite of this, she was able to capture the attention of her clients and establish her business. \r\n\r\nThis loan is for working capital so that Esperanza can buy her products from a variety of distributors. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Sarah Bishop, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":263728,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Working capital","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Leon","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.435556 -86.879444","type":"point"}},"partner_id":96,"posted_date":"2009-02-01T15:20:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":500,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Esperanza Del Socorro","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-28T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":9800,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-27T08:00:00Z","amount":816.67},{"due_date":"2009-03-29T07:00:00Z","amount":816.67},{"due_date":"2009-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":816.67},{"due_date":"2009-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":816.67},{"due_date":"2009-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":816.67},{"due_date":"2009-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":816.67},{"due_date":"2009-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":816.67},{"due_date":"2009-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":816.67},{"due_date":"2009-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":816.67},{"due_date":"2009-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":816.67},{"due_date":"2009-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":816.67},{"due_date":"2010-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":816.63}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.63}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":41.67,"local_amount":816.67,"processed_date":"2009-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T08:42:06Z","rounded_local_amount":837.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20400031},{"amount":65.76,"local_amount":1288.98,"processed_date":"2009-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T18:38:29Z","rounded_local_amount":1322.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27092029},{"amount":17.56,"local_amount":344.36,"processed_date":"2009-04-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T16:40:17Z","rounded_local_amount":353.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35985412},{"amount":43.39,"local_amount":850.51,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T23:11:52Z","rounded_local_amount":872.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44446027},{"amount":189.22,"local_amount":3708.73,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T20:41:51Z","rounded_local_amount":3804.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52956666},{"amount":142.4,"local_amount":2790.75,"processed_date":"2009-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T21:42:10Z","rounded_local_amount":2862.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96948002}],"funded_date":"2009-02-01T16:34:38Z","paid_date":"2009-11-15T21:42:10Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sarah Bishop","image":107465}},{"id":90750,"name":"Alfrido","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Alfrido C., 53, is married to Susana C..

Madina started her business last year after her husband died.  She has four children that she is looking after.  The two who are at home helped her start her restaurant and the others who are in school helped over the holidays when they were at home.  Her restaurant has enjoyed great success so far because she sells her food out of her house and many people in her community know her very well, so she attracts many customers. She is requesting a loan to stock some supplies for her restaurant.  She will buy things like potatoes, flour, sugar, salt, and other things she can get in bulk. Madina hopes that someday she will be able to build a standalone restaurant.

Masomgbo Primary School in Masomgbo, one of the villages surrounding Makeni City. This school was established by the Roman Catholics in 1950 to train children of the Masomgbo community, and villages close to it, as future leaders. Over the years, the school has produced a great number of lecturers, teachers, and other professionals in different walks of life. Currently, the school has 554 pupils and a staff of 17 teachers.  \r\n\r\nWith this loan, some of the teachers will start small businesses, and those who already run businesses will invest their loans into them. Some staff members will be using their loans to buy pieces of furniture, others to pay either for their children's education or their own further studies, while others will use their loans for home-building projects.  \r\n\r\nFifty-five-year-old Alie A. S. (right) is the headmaster of the school, and has been a teacher for over 32 years. He was born in Masomgbo village, and is married with ten children \u2013 some of his children are in primary school, some in secondary school, and others are in college.

Elsa sells her products in the main market in her town and on some occasions she also brings them to another city close to her own.

Purita Tanulo, Brgy Pilar, Hinigaran, Negros Occidental. She is 44 years old. Her husband, Ricardo, operates their motorboat for fishing and also helps her in running an oyster and crabs business. They have four children ranging in age from 4 to 24 years old. Alicia wants her children to finish their studies and get good jobs, to help her husband for additional income, and hopes that their businesses will continue to bring more blessings to the family.\r\n\r\nWhen Alicia was still single, she would help her parents in running the business of oyster breeding until such time when her parents gave her a portion of their oyster breeding business for her to manage. She managed it well and was able to contribute income to her family. When she got married, she continued her business and her husband invested in the oyster business for expansion. \r\n\r\nIn 2001, Alicia joined NWTF-Project Dungganon to have an additional capital for her business. To expand, she needed bamboo, nets, rope and other materials for good results and better income. As the loan continued, she was able to buy a motorized boat for fishing, which was used in catching crabs. In their business she was able to earn a minimum of 10,000 PHP per month. This income was utilized for the education of their children and some were used to defray family expenses.\r\n\r\nAlicia's previous loan of 19,500 PHP was fully utilized for her oyster breeding and the amount was fully paid on time without any delay. Now on her eighth cycle loan, the same amount of 19,500 PHP will be used for fishing and oyster breeding.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project \"Dungganon\" (a Hiligaynon word that means \"Honorable\"). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress out of earning less than $1 a day to  achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them \"Dungganon\" -  a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":441219,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fishing","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Working

She is a responsible person and one of the more punctual members of the group.\r\n<p>\r\nSra. Ana is new to the Communal Bank, but she is a dynamic person who sells groceries out of her own home.  In the evenings, she sells hamburgers and fried chicken.  Her family is very proud of her because she is a hard worker.\r\n<p>\r\nAll of the members are grateful to Emprender and Kiva for demonstrating their confidence in them by providing this loan.<br

Soprano exudes self confidence and self esteem at first glance. He has invariably believed in his worth from his early 20s. These traits have been winning trump cards for him in successfully operating his 15-year-old retail and charcoal sales businesses in Kyaliwajjala-Mukono. At 43 years, S. has a success story connected with him that can act as motivation for today\u2019s youth. Most youth lack that self-initiative, which normally comes about as a result of low self-esteem. For this happy-go-lucky married father of 5, a strong belief in your own abilities is a big plus especially from the point of view of running and consolidating any business enterprise. \r\n\r\nS. surprisingly got inspiration from his wife.

His principal crops are coffee and bananas, but some time ago he joined other members of his community in forming a cooperative to increase plantings of coffee and obtain a better price for their coffee.  But agreeing that he needs to work more to produce high-quality coffee, he is going to the city of La Merced to increase his earnings and invest more in reaching his goal, which is to increase his culitvation of coffee.  This is his fourth loan from MFP (local lending institution), and he feels that his village bank has taught him many things about resolving agricultural problems.  He is grateful for this advice.  And because of this advice he decided to invest the loan proceeds in 20 sacks of fertilizer, which sell for about $64 (S\/. 180.00 nuevos soles) per sack.  \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":649144,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Purchase 20 sacks of feritlizer.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Chanchamayo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.05 -75.316667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-11-24T23:20:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":30,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Andres ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-11-11T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2800,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":2800}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":1000,"local_amount":2800,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:47:43Z","rounded_local_amount":2805,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232850425}],"funded_date":"2010-11-25T03:52:10Z","paid_date":"2011-10-15T09:47:43Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jeff Schell","image":null}},{"id":255490,"name":"Rosalinda","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rosalinda M. is from the village of Bato Plaridel.

Marta is aware of her limitations since the only courses she completed were in high school, but she did not graduate.  However, she does not allow this to be an excuse that prevents her from pursuing her dream of having a business.  Following the advice of her family, Marta started producing cacao.  Thanks to her perseverance and enthusiasm, she was able to achieve one of her goals which was to improve her quality of life.  Today she produces two outstanding products, coffee and cacao.

She decided to work from her home four years ago with the intention of caring for her children and providing for their education. As far as education is concerned, she is not behind. Her certificates in beauty and nail care demonstrate that she is a person who wishes to do better, especially by showing her interest in preparing herself professionally. This new business has provided her the opportunity to offer financial support for her children\u2019s education. She is very organized, carries a journal with her accounts and takes care of her monthly bookkeeping. As a result, she knows exactly how much her business brings in and how much she spends on expenses. Her store, Tienda Milena, is registered with the municipality, and so her business possesses all necessary permits to operate. She started her business with 70,000 CRC [$140] that her husband gave her, which she invested in merchandise. With this capital she began to develop her business, which has allowed her the training to diversify her services (nail care).\r\nWith respect to the financial aspect of her business, it recovers weekly. An analysis of her books shows that her revenues generate a profit of 71,000 CRC [$140], including the loan payment and supplier payments, which indicates her ability to cover the cost of this transaction.\r\nHer place of business is in her house, and her store Tienda Milena is legally registered. She is currently in her third year at a well-regarded institute in Costa Rica that specializes in body cosmetics, and began to work on foot and nail care two years ago. She has the support of a team of beauticians. With respect to business, she manages a portfolio of clients on credit who, thanks to her credit facilities, are constantly making purchases.\r\nThe loan will be used to purchase merchandise (clothing, perfume, cosmetics, and undergarments) and materials (nail polish and others for feet and nails). With this loan, she hopes to increase her business revenues since working capital has been a limiting factor. After attending a meeting and hearing about the Fundaci\u00f3n Mujer and Kiva, she saw the possibility of realizing her dreams of starting to save for her own house and to be able to offer her children a better quality education so that they can have professional careers.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":884068,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty

This is Luafulufa 's third loan with SPBD. \r\n\r\n\r\n*SPBD evaluates the living conditions of each of its borrowers.  Generally, a loan manager evaluates a variety of social metrics on a scale out of 3 (the higher the number, the better off the person is) and these are averaged for the \"overall social metric score.\"  For example, a 3 out of 3 on \"level of education\" would mean that the borrower has graduated from university.  \r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD: \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.

Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions as they lack tangible collateral assets. This leads to poor financial support, hence poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. SELFINA buys and leases equipment to women.

She is 44 years old. Rosario is married and has four school-aged children. To make a living, Rosario owns & operates a rice field business in the agriculture sector raising crops. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from planting & harvesting rice for sale. Rosario has been engaged in her business for over five years and earns approximately 8000 PHP a month for these activities. <p>In 2008, Rosario joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Rosario has successfully repaid a previous loan from PMPC. Rosario is requesting a new loan of 10000 PHP, which will be used to purchase fertilizer such as manure. This loan will be the third loan taken out by Rosario from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\nAbout PMPC: Paglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She is a professional decorator of handicrafts. Since 1996, she has been using beads and other materials to make flowers on women's clothes to earn a living, typically making US$2.5 each day. She decorates a kind of Khmer traditional dress and people wear it during Water Festival, P\u2019chum Ben or Khmer New Year.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She has three children, but only her 13 year old son lives with her.  Her other two children are a 20 year old woman and a 23 year old man.  They have their own independent lives.\n\nApproximately eight years ago she suffered through a divorce.  She had to support her three children alone.  That is why she learned the hairdressing and beautician profession.  She now has her beauty station in her own locale. \n\nShe is proud of her effort because she has known how to get her children ahead, and she loves her work.  Her son that no longer lives with her works selling seafood.  He visits her all of the time, and he helps her with some activities in her business.\n\nHer big goal is to buy a new car in order to move around easier and to be able to share more time with her children.  She requested a loan from the Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa in order to improve her business.   She will buy new furnishing in order to attract more customers. That way she will achieve the goal that she longs for.\n\nWith determination this woman has known how to overcome obstacles.  She now very happily tells us that her sacrifices have born fruit.  She practices her profession with great joy, and she is close to her children.  Now, the next step is to improve her quality of life.

The distribution of farming inputs is part of One Acre Fund\u2019s integrated agriculture package, which includes training, reliable input supply (such as fertilizer and seeds), credit and insurance.\r\n\r\nWith income from his maize sales, Enos will educate his children, build a house and invest in livestock rearing.\r\n\r\nIn 2012, the members of Mwambuli Women group will each plant maize plots between \u00bd and 1 acre of land.

The school does not currently have access to consistent clean drinking water and therefore has to spend a considerable portion of their budget on firewood, which is used to boil water for the children. Installing a water filtration systems will therefore save the schools money in the long-term as the cost of firewood will be reduced.

She is married to Thierry AGOSSA, a welder, and is the mother of five children, four of whom are in school.  Currently a retailer of pagnes (colorful West African cloth) and shoes, she has embraced numerous kinds of work in the past.  A hairdresser by profession, she had gotten started very early on selling rice door-to-door.  In December 2006, she came to sign her first loan contract for the amount of 40,000 francs CFA in order to bolster her capital.  With this loan, she realized sufficient savings.  With a plan for commerce in beauty products and, little by little, pagnes purchased at the Dantokpa marketplace, she requested as her third loan the amount of 50,000 francs.  Thanks to her distribution method, she has so far procured many customers and a good foundation in the domain of selling pagnes.  She nows wants to sign her fifth loan contract and is asking for the amount of 120,000 francs.  \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":205240,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To buy lengths of pagnes, pairs of shoe, and boxes of soap and detergent ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BJ","country":"Benin","town":"Cotonou Agence principale","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"9.5 2.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":104,"posted_date":"2008-09-19T16:40:53Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":275,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Florence","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-10-03T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":120000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":12000},{"due_date":"2008-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":12000},{"due_date":"2009-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":12000},{"due_date":"2009-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":12000},{"due_date":"2009-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":12000},{"due_date":"2009-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":12000},{"due_date":"2009-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":12000},{"due_date":"2009-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":12000},{"due_date":"2009-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":12000},{"due_date":"2009-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":12000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":27.5,"local_amount":12000,"processed_date":"2008-11-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-15T18:44:47Z","rounded_local_amount":12615.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5284579},{"amount":27.5,"local_amount":12000,"processed_date":"2008-12-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-15T10:21:28Z","rounded_local_amount":12615.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9897500},{"amount":27.5,"local_amount":12000,"processed_date":"2009-01-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T09:35:12Z","rounded_local_amount":12615.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14821440},{"amount":27.5,"local_amount":12000,"processed_date":"2009-02-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-15T08:35:48Z","rounded_local_amount":12615.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20357703},{"amount":27.5,"local_amount":12000,"processed_date":"2009-03-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T09:28:51Z","rounded_local_amount":12615.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27046756},{"amount":27.5,"local_amount":12000,"processed_date":"2009-04-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T10:15:34Z","rounded_local_amount":12615.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35938378},{"amount":27.5,"local_amount":12000,"processed_date":"2009-05-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T20:46:37Z","rounded_local_amount":12615.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44396066},{"amount":27.5,"local_amount":12000,"processed_date":"2009-06-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T17:05:43Z","rounded_local_amount":12615.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52903937},{"amount":27.5,"local_amount":12000,"processed_date":"2009-07-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T10:23:59Z","rounded_local_amount":12615.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63125944},{"amount":27.5,"local_amount":12000,"processed_date":"2009-08-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T10:48:48Z","rounded_local_amount":12615.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73549431}],"funded_date":"2008-09-19T18:01:36Z","paid_date":"2009-09-15T10:48:48Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Daniel Kuey","image":669418}},{"id":70302,"name":"Iv\u00e1n","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El Sr. Ivan tiene 36 a\u00f1os de edad, habita en el barrio Medardo Andino del municipio de Ticuantepe, es casado y le tienen dos hijos que son menores de edad, su esposa es ama de casa.

Every day he tends to his fields. In the case of corn, he dries it and later threshes it, puts it in sacks and stores it for future sales. The process for planting his fields is first to prepare them with organic fertilizer, plow and sow them, and afterwards irrigate and apply fertilizer and insecticides, if necessary. All this is to insure a good harvest.<p>\r\n\r\nAhror has a friendly family who always tries to help others. In the picture you can see Ahror\u2019s son who also helps him with his business.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <p>\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <p>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<p>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has produced famous thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. A civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged an already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural productivity and the manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b><br>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent viable business prospects.

Wilmer lives with his mom, who has a small grocery store that Wilmer wants to supply with part of the credit he is requesting.  He will also buy more clothing to sell.  His clients are his neighbors and people who travel in the area.  They know him and admire him a lot since he has a physical shortcoming (a spinal deformation).  He doesn't stop working, and his dream is to grow and increase his profits.  He invests $417 and sells $767 every month, which means he has a monthly profit of $350.  Wilmer is very happy and is very friendly.  It was very pleasant to spend the afternoon with him.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Tanya Harper, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":415617,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Used Clothing","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"Purchase of used clothing","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"Tegucigalpa","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"14.1 -87.216667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":118,"posted_date":"2009-10-28T00:40:14Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Wilmer ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-10-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-27T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2009-12-27T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2010-01-27T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2010-02-27T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2010-03-27T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2010-04-27T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2010-05-27T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2010-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2010-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2010-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2010-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2010-10-27T07:00:00Z","amount":833.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.84},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.84},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.84},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.84}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":45.83,"local_amount":833.33,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:28:00Z","rounded_local_amount":866.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103863406},{"amount":45.84,"local_amount":833.33,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T16:28:40Z","rounded_local_amount":866.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110753100},{"amount":91.67,"local_amount":1666.66,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:29:03Z","rounded_local_amount":1732.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118142154},{"amount":45.83,"local_amount":833.33,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:53:19Z","rounded_local_amount":866.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":129010555},{"amount":45.83,"local_amount":833.33,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T12:04:32Z","rounded_local_amount":866.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136734922},{"amount":137.5,"local_amount":2499.99,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:55:53Z","rounded_local_amount":2598.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144768381},{"amount":45.83,"local_amount":833.33,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-16T09:16:41Z","rounded_local_amount":866.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159799719},{"amount":45.83,"local_amount":833.33,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:52:54Z","rounded_local_amount":866.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166904907},{"amount":45.84,"local_amount":833.37,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:37:22Z","rounded_local_amount":866.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172172807}],"funded_date":"2009-10-28T15:02:52Z","paid_date":"2010-10-15T10:37:22Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tanya Harper","image":783083}},{"id":152376,"name":"Cristina Isabel","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"la se\u00f1ora Cristina Isabel S.

He is 31 years old and lives in his parents' home in San Pablo neighborhood.  He is the oldest of three siblings.\r\n\r\nFabio tells us that he has worked for a long time for other companies who make garments and embroideries.  However, over time and bearing in mind the knowledge which he had acquired as regards the production process, working machines and serving customers, Fabio decided to set up his own small business.  Helped by family members who provided him with space in their homes, he was able to set up an office and a workshop.  He acquired his first machine for making embroideries which was originally enough to cover the first jobs that he carried out in his own business.\r\n\r\nHowever, for some years he couldn't manage with the orders which he had and so, through a lot of hard work, he acquired a new, more sophisticated machine which was able to produce 10 embroidery designs in 10 minutes.  In this way he is currently able to satisfy his customers who work for a number of well-known companies.\r\n\r\nFabio loves creating his own embroidery designs since it allows him to offer a range of

goats, cows and horses. Kyrgyz people are proud of their horsemanship. It is often said that Kyrgyz boys learn to ride before they can walk. Cattle and other animals have played a tremendous role in Kyrgyz culture and history since nomadic times.\r\n  \r\nAnarkul A., 54, is the leader of this group. A proud mother of five children, she values animals like her own family. Her mother taught her to have a tender attitude towards animals so that they, in turn, can feel and reward you with help in hard times. \r\n\r\n<p>Anarkul's husband coaches in a local sports school and devotes his entire free time to helping Anarkul feed the cattle and take them to a cattle yard. Their children are no longer financially dependent on Anarkul and her husband. The reselling of cattle allows the couple to cover their daily expenses and improve home comforts. The idea originated two years ago, thanks to the advice of close friends, well-trained cattle breeders. The couple borrowed some funds to start up the business. They later earned enough to repay their debts in time. Now that the business allows her to cover her costs, Anarkul gathered together this group, which she believes deserves financial assistance from Kiva lenders. Anarkul is a very responsible and self-organized leader who promises to repay the loan on time. Her personal purpose for the loan is to purchase extra heads of cattle for further resale. \r\n\r\n         --- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance (MBF), a young, ambitious and socially-focused microfinance institution in Kyrgyzstan.

He is 16 and goes to preparatory school.\r\n\r\nDo\u00f1a Glora is a very hard-working, happy, and chatty woman who, more than 15 years ago, with the support of her husband, opened a little grocery store in her home with the idea of helping her husband a little with the household expenses. With the passage of time, her business has been growing and providing more. She says that she and her family tend to the business, which is open every day from eight in the morning until nine at night, and she always likes to have even just a bit of everything so that her customers always find what they need and thus are encouraged to come back to buy from her.\r\n\r\nShe needs this loan to invest in the purchase of rice, beans, soup, oil, bleach, soap, sweets, toilet paper, sugar, coffee, salt, and soft drinks to restock her business and continue with her sales.\r\n\r\nDo\u00f1a Gloria hopes that with this loan her business will continue growing, since she wants to support her son so that he can study for a career.\r\n\r\nThe other members of the group are: Abel, who sells bread; Georgina, who sells beverages; Maria, who sells handicrafts; Antelma, who sells handicrafts; Dulce Maria, who has a nutritional club; Leonor, who sells cosmetics; Lidia, who sells tupperware; Maribel, who sells chicken;

Her major challenge in farming remains the rampant animal diseases but she is optimistic that she will be owning five dairy cows in five years."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":986307,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

SELFINA has taken a leading role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions as they lack tangible collateral assets. This leads to poor financial support, hence poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. SELFINA buys and leases equipment to women. Where a client needs working capital SELFINA buys equipment from said client, extending a loan to her, then leasing back the same equipment\u2014a process called a sale and leaseback

He has owned his own store for the past 28 years. Irshad baji is the mother of four kids: three sons and one daughter. All of her kids are currently attending the local school, and one of her sons is memorizing the holy book \u201cQuran-e-Pak\u201d. \r\n<p>\r\nIrshad baji is a very responsible lady. She helps her husband at the family business, making sweetmeats. She has successfully repaid her first loan from Asasah (a microfinance institute of Pakistan). She is applying again for a loan to buy materials (sugar, cooking oil and dry fruits) to expand her husband\u2019s sweetmeat business. \r\n<p>\r\nShe joined her current loan group with several women in her local community, all of whom are seeking to expand their family businesses. Sugran baji wants a loan to buy clothes for her clothes selling business. Atharan baji wants a loan to expand her sweetmeat selling business. Maryam baji wants a loan to buy another buffalo for her milk selling business. Ashran baji wants a loan to drive an auto-rickshaw (a local three-wheeled motor vehicle).\r\n<p>\r\nThis is a group loan. The loan funds will be distributed among the group members, each of whom will invest in her own business. The members mutually guarantee one another's loans.

Thanks to the house she was able to build, her children have grown up under a roof where they have passed the best years of their childhood. Her desire to advance led her to work selling cosmetics, which she has learned to manage over time. In the beginning, she was owed many debts, but came to realize that being constant in collection and attending to her customers was most important. After obtaining some experience, her business grew little by little and now she is about to become one of the head promoters of the line she sells, as her great abilities have made her one of the best beauty consultants. This motivates her to continue advancing, and she hopes that with time she will not be just another employee, but rather a manager with a stand of diverse products so people will not have to wait to place orders--they will have the convenience of finding better products in her store. Gladys has worked with MFP for more than four years; this is her eighth loan. Along with her group companions, she strives to keep working with much commitment and responsibility. With the 800 soles she is soliciting, she will take advantage of catalog discounts and acquire greater quantities of products to sell them at better prices and generate an additional income in her business.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Trisha Bury, Kiva

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is 65 years old, is widowed, and has eight adult children.\r\n\r\nLaureta owns and operates a sari-sari (variety) retail shop, selling both food and daily use products in the local community. She has been engaged in her business for over a year and earns approximately 2,000 PHP a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Laureta joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 11,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional products to sell.\r\n\r\nLaureta is requesting a new loan of 14,000 PHP which will be used to purchase new items to expand her product offering. This loan will be her 4th from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business. \r\n\r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n\r\n *Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

C. is from the village of Anonang, Aurora, Zamboanga Del Sur.

The main source of income for the business comes from buying and selling crabs in the local community. Ledenisa has been engaged in her business for over five years and earns approximately 3,000 Philippine pesos a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Ledenisa joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Ledenisa is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional crabs to sell. This will be the first loan taken out by Ledenisa from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family and to pay tuition for her children. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.

Now his mototaxi has begun to experience some technical problems that urgently need repair  to be able to run correctly.  That is why he is asking for a loan for the first time with Edpyme Alternativa of 1000 new sols.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He did the same in secondary school, until he finished secondary school. Afterwards, he had to work to be able to survive and he began to work in butchering pigs and later cattle. With the first cow he bought and sold he made C$4,000 cordobas. He also was able to transfer his business to the downtown of the El Regadio community, town of Estel\u00ed, to sell meat in the local markets of Estel\u00ed. He dis this without leaving farming behind, the activity he learned as a child.  \r\n \r\nHe is asking for the loan to buy cattle, since in this way he hopes to increase his sales as well as his customers. \r\n\r\nAmong his plans is becoming the exclusive provider of meat to the supermarkets.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

For the past five years, since her husband\u2019s death, Ajarkul and her oldest son are also raising and reselling cattle. \r\n\r\nShe has always seen the high potential of raising livestock in the village of Kyzyl Suu in Issyk Kul province due to its highland pastures. The fresh air and favorable climate create nice living conditions for local livestock. Earning 3000 soms a month assists her with covering major expenses for her youngest son who is a third grade student. \r\n\r\nThe expansive household of Ajarkul has attracted a lot of attention from local and foreign wholesale dealers. The process of reselling is intensive this current season and Ajarkul is busy with buying young calves and sending them to pasture. The short term goal is to buy several more young livestock for further fattening and reselling.

However, when Friendship Bridge gave them the opportunity for a loan, they decided to change their future. <P>\r\nThe majority of these clients are asking for a loan of approximately $300 US dollars.  This reflects that these women are having business success.  The success of their businesses can also be seen as a product of their constant work.  The loan that this group is requesting will be their tenth from our institution. <P>\r\nThe women will primarily use their loans to buy raw material in order to make typical dresses and in order to purchase and sell them. Although the credit that the majority of the women will receive will be invested in fabric and thereby could cause a saturation of the market, these clients are confident in the success of their business because Nahual\u00e1 weaving is in great demand due to its quality and beauty. <P>\r\nDo\u00f1a Lucia Quich\u00e9 would love for her business to expand so that she could buy a car and not have to carry her merchandise to market every day.
