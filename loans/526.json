It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.<P>\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.<P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n<P>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He is 48 years old, lives alone in his own home, and has been separated for the past 20 years.  He has a 17 year old son who is studying in the city of Tarma, which is 5 hours away by car from his home.  Esteban enjoys his work.  As a young man, he liked to engage in hard labor and taking care of plants because he knew these activities could bring in a good income.  For this reason, he gets up early in the morning to remove all the weeds and shrubs around his plantation.  He enjoys planting coffee the most even though it takes three years for the crop to mature.  Estaban also likes the harvest season when he can bring his goods to market and earn a good profit.  With the savings he accumulates, he invests in the crops for the following season and also sends some spending money to his son for school, since he wants him to become a professional.    \r\n<p>\r\nEsteban is very grateful to the president of his Communal Bank for inviting him to be part of their group.  He has agreed to make all his payments on time so that he does not disappoint the other members.

She is 35 years old, single and lives in a home that was provided by social services for her and her 3 sisters, whom she cares for.  She has never been married.  She studied until 12th grade and she also pays for her sisters\u2019 schooling.  She also sends money to her mother, who lives in Gaza province.  Ancha grew up with her parents in Maputo and later her mother moved to Gaza, where Ancha also moved in 1986.  Twenty years later she and her 3 sisters moved back to Boane.  She is a typist for the Regional Water Administration (ARA in Portuguese), and receives 7.000,00MT per month.  Before she began working for this public company, she worked for Radio Mozambique for six years, in the same capacity.  This is her second loan with Hluvuku-Adsema for 17.000,00MT.  She will use the money to buy cement, steel, rocks and other materials needed to build a brick home.  Her previous loan was used for household items, thanks to information she received from coworkers.  She pledges to pay this loan with no problems so she will qualify for loans in the future.  In the near future she would like to get married and return to school to attend college.  \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Rachel Crouch, Kiva

shared by Mrs. Evangeline P. one of the responsible mothers in bry. Roxas, Solano,Nueva Vizcaya. She is married to Mr. Alfredo P. but unfortunately, they are not blessed with a child. Although, they legally adopted a child whom they called Mark Justin P. 7 years old a grade-I pupil. They want their adopted child to be successful in the future so that he will be the one to take care of them when they got old. In this regard, they are doing all their best to support his education so that he will find a stable job someday. \n\tFarming is the common source of their living, they till their land twice a year by planting rice and some vegetables. Since harvesting takes a long time, Mrs. Evangeline put-up a small sari-sari or general store in their village to earn additional income. She used the loan she availed in the Microfinance organization to acquire different grocery items, soft drinks and frozen foods. Her average income for month is amounting to P 5,000.00 which they utilized to acquire their daily basic needs and to pay her weekly loan amortization. Due to our economic crisis, she wants to strengthen her small business to increase her income to satisfy their basic needs and save for their future. She applied a higher amount of P 5,000.00 to strengthen her capital in improving her small store. She wants to buy more grocery items to be able to increase more profit.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":125,"image":{"id":404770,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

J.\u2019s three children, aged from 20 to 27, are already adults with her two eldest now having their own family, she still doesn\u2019t want to resign from her career of being a mother to them. She wants to support their lives and those of their own families until they can get out from the umbrella of poverty. Menda\u2019s husband was unemployed and that has added to the challenges of her life as a woman and the need to become productive. \r\n\r\n<p>With faith that one day she will be able to find a way to improve the life of her family, Menda was very happy to learn about ASHI way back in 2005. Then Menda and her husband agreed that she must join ASHI so she could request a loan which would be their source of financial capital to start up a business to earn a daily income. They thought of setting up a small eatery since her husband is a good cook. \r\n\r\n<p>After several loans from ASHI, their eatery has eventually grown and has been sustained. Menda has also been able to finance a 'buy and sell' business in partnership with her unemployed eldest son. Proceeds are equally divided between them so her son can support his own family's needs. The loan will be used to purchase bulk ingredients for cooking foods for her eatery. Some of the loan will be used to purchase bulk onions, salt and garlic for her son's 'buy and sell' business.\r\n\r\nAs much as possible, Menda wants to grow and stabilize her eatery and her 'buy and sell' business through the support of loans through ASHI. Proceeds of her business would enable her to support her dream of sending her two children back to school until they graduate from college so they can have a different kind of life in the future - a life that is not poor.

After the winter season, the harvest is stored for a while as its price increases before being sold at the big markets of San, Dah, and other nearby markets, retail (often wholesale too) for cash to customers mostly coming from big towns. \r\n\r\nAfter selling their produce, each group member expects to obtain an income  between  21,000  and 39,500 West African francs, which will be used to pay off the loan interest and cover ongoing family expenses.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Ekaterina Sukhanova, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":567425,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"Purchasing agricultural inputs, seeds and small tools","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Dangasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ami ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ami ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Djeneba ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Setou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ami ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sanata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kadia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alima ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Minata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-06-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":520000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":520000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":1000,"local_amount":520000,"processed_date":"2011-03-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T12:12:57Z","rounded_local_amount":520693.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201360747}],"funded_date":"2010-08-05T23:33:27Z","paid_date":"2011-04-15T12:12:57Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Katharina S","image":340594}},{"id":218282,"name":"Kiden","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Kiden J.  is currently in the business of selling dried fish and tomatoes at the market and is requesting a loan to stock bags of rice and beans to sell.

Emilia has been engaged in her business for over 11 years and earns approximately 3500 PHP whenever she sells her raised animal.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Emilia joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. She is requesting a loan of 5000 PHP which will be used to purchase livestock feed and other supplies. This will be the first loan that Emilia has taken out from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines.

She is 51 years old and is the group leader of this ten-member group loan offered by ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nWilma is married and has two adult children. She owns and operates a business making and selling food, primarily preparing and selling cooked food for daily meals. She has been engaged in her business for over two years and earns approximately 2,500 PHP a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Wilma joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 7,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell.\r\n\r\nWilma is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional inventory and used as working capital. This loan will be her 4th from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to financially support immediate members of her family. \r\n\r\n\r\n<b>About ASKI:<\/b>\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has twenty-one branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolk and small-business entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n\r\n<font size=\"1\"> <b>*Note:<\/b> To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.<\/font>\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1150,"image":{"id":606730,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

Alma joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1998 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 14 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Alma has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 7,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 4,300, uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 15th loan, she is borrowing PHP 10,000, which she intends to use to buy fertilizers and glutinous rice for her food vending so that she can continue to save or the future education of her child. Alma S. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

through and overcome. Our CCT* community partner, Revelieta D. C. or Nene as friends call her, proves it to be so. At 30, Revelieta has reached college and is married to Eddie, an ice cream maker. Their sweet marriage brought to life one child, who is in elementary school. REvelieta's family resides in Caloocan City, Philippines.\r\n\r\nAt present, Revelieta focuses on running her sari-sari (variety) store. She aims to meet the daily needs of her neighborhood with soft drinks and grocery items such as shampoo, canned goods, seasonings, among others. She also sells products from Avon, a brand of beauty products. With this business, Revelieta earns an average of Php300 a day.\r\n\r\nRevelieta knows inside of her that the variety store would not be enough to meet the needs and wants of her family. To continue operation of her business, she would like to apply for Php11, 000 loan. She plans to use this money to add more items to her store. \r\n\r\nOne challenge Revelieta faces at present is the difficulty of updating people with the payment of their debts. All that she dreams of in life is to make her family happy and give them a house they could call their own. She gives her best to make sure her only child gets a good education until  college. Life is not all the time sweet, but with all the efforts she is doing for her family, she sees to it that she will emerge an overcomer bringing home a sweet success. \r\n\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance

All the children attend school except one. \r\n\r\nShe has requested this loan of 50,000 KES through Juhudi Kilimo to purchase a dairy cow.

She buys her products based on the time of year, or for an upcoming holiday.  For example, in the summer she sells t-shirts and handbags.  She also focuses on certain holidays: for Mother\u2019s Day, she buys chocolates and women\u2019s accessories; for Father\u2019s Day, she buys men\u2019s products; for birthdays, she buys toys; for Christmas, she buys all types of items to give as gifts.  \r\n\r\nShe buys her merchandise in the city of Santiago, since she can obtain a greater variety of products there.  Also, Naya likes to buy high-quality merchandise in order to keep her customers.  Naya works Monday to Sunday from a location she has on the street.  She has dedicated herself to this business for 30 years.\r\n\r\nShe will use the loan to buy socks, t-shirts, knitwear, and fleece for men, women and children, as these are the items she sells the most of during the winter season.  Her goal is to move her business to an established site, as it is difficult to work on the street during summer and winter because of the hot and cold temperatures.  Her motivation to continue working is her desire to help support her family.\r\n\r\nNaya lives with her husband and 9-year old daughter.  This family is currently going through a very painful time, due to the passing of Naya\u2019s oldest son 6 months ago.  Her dream is to provide a quality education for her daughter, and see her become a career professional.  Naya is very thankful for access to credit and the support provided by Fondo Esperanza for carrying on with her enterprise.  She finds the group\u2019s meetings to be very pleasant, and serves as the Secretary of the management board.  \r\n\r\nValpara\u00edso is located 120 km northeast of Santiago.  It is the regional capital, and also the seat of legislative power of the country.

family and two sons, who are seven and five years old, in the the Oi-Tal village (north-eastern part of Kyrgyzstan).  In search of a source of income, Akylbek started his own business of breeding livestock, growing and reselling agricultural crops in 1996.  Akylbek has apple and pear trees on his plot of land and also devotes special attention to cultivating and growing a particular variety of potatoes that is in higher demand among the local residents.  His persistent and tireless labor in the business allows Akylbek to cover his family's and household expenses and also to plan his children's future.  In order to further increase his livestock quantity, Akylbek requested a loan in the sum of 80,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" to buy additional livestock headcount for fattening up.  He plans to use the planned profit for the purchase of fodder and hay for the winter, so that he can start reselling livestock in the spring."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1775,"image":{"id":909266,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase livestock","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Oi-Tal village","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2011-11-04T04:40:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1775,"lender_count":61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Akylbek","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-10-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":80000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":1775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2012-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":40000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":887.5},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":887.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":887.5,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T12:17:23Z","rounded_local_amount":40416.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322938339},{"amount":887.5,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T11:14:47Z","rounded_local_amount":40416.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419776801}],"funded_date":"2011-11-18T09:46:40Z","paid_date":"2013-11-17T11:14:47Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Anna Sorokina","image":null}},{"id":357647,"name":"Jacklyne","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jacklyne is a hardworking business woman aged 29.

She is 35 years old, married and the mother of three children 9, 4 and 1 year old. The oldest attends school. She completed 10th grade and is still studying- she is currently in the second year of teacher training. She lives with her family in her own home, and supports her mother who lives in the village of Mahubo sending her money for household expenses. \r\n\r\nShe has never left Boane district, and was born in Mahubo. Later, she built a home with her family in the Fichi neighborhood of Boane where she continues to live. She has been an employee of the Ministry of Education for over nine years, and was trained at the Teacher Training Center in Namaacha. She works from 11 am until 5:55 pm and earns a monthly salary of 4500 MZN, which she uses for household expenses as well as saving some in her bank account. \r\n\r\nShe has never taken out loans with other banks, and learned about Hluvuku through friends who are also clients of the organization. This is her fourth loan, for 10,000 MZN, which she plans to use to buy construction materials (cement, rebar, sand, stone and others) to continue building her residence. The previous loans were for 10,000, 15,000 and 30,000 MZN, all for the same purpose. In the future she would like to take out additional loans to complete construction of her house and invest more in the business that she is starting.  \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese

While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n<p>\r\nJocelyn is married and has one infant child. To make a living, Jocelyn owns and operates a business that provides recycling services. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from collecting junk and other waste material for local businesses and community members. Jocelyn has been engaged in her business for over two years, and earns approximately 5,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2009, Jocelyn joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Jocelyn has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10,000 PHP from ASKI. She is requesting a new loan of 13,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional waste and junk materials to sell. This loan will be the second loan taken out by Jocelyn from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated by the business to make improvements to her house. \r\n<p>\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n<p>\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs. \r\n<p>\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Habibulo is from the district of Dj.Rasulov, Tajikistan. Currently, he dedicates himself to his livestock business, a popular enterprise that is characteristic of the region. He is the father of 4 children who he cares for and has the responsibility of educating. It\u2019s important to note that Habibulo is very conscious of his duty to support his family financially. For this reason, he turned to IMON International to obtain a loan to purchase some pregnant cows to help him increase his income. With your help, Habibulo will be able to make his business succeed and support his family. \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes being a key post along the Silk Road and marking the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He will be seated at his 'desk', composed of a plastic chair and table, alongsiD. his wooden display filled with sweets and snacks, selling to pedestrians who circulate there. The latter have also provided potential that motivated him to start his other business, offering telephone calling plans.\r\n\r\nIvan is a young Carib, by nature happy and cordial, who belongs to \u201cAsovesur\u201d, the organization that brings together all the stationary merchants located around BaranquilL.'s 'Metrocentro', its commercial center.  They will soon be relocated to a gallery in construction as ordered by the state, as part of the city's pedestrian zone organizing process. Ivan's business is located where there is much competition and he takes advantage of that. He knows his competitors and understands that his sustainability depends upon interrelations with them, as does increasing his income, which is occurring day to day.\r\n\r\nIvan's punctual repayment of his 4 loans with the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo have distinguished him. For this reason, he is now soliciting a Kiva loan to continue increasing his sales, augmenting his working capital, and to continue improving his family's standard of living, as he has been doing up to now. With this loan he wants to acquire additional cellular phone plans and to buy the products generally needed by a tobacconist's shop. In the future he plans to obtain his own home through the 'Sue\u00f1os y Opportunidades' (Dreams and Opportunities) program in Villas D. San Pablo, by means of which the Foundation works with state subsidies to offer loans to assist with the financial closing for dwellings.\r\n <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Harold Sims,

in GMA, Cavite, Philippines.  With the help of her four working children, she works hard daily to earn a living and able to send her youngest child even up to college.\r\n\r\nAt present, Leticia focuses on running her sari-sari (variety) store. She aims to meet the daily needs of her neighborhood in soft drinks and grocery items such as shampoo, and also canned goods, and seasonings, among others. With this business, Leticia earns an average of Php 300 a day.\r\n\r\nLeticia knows inside her that the sari-sari store will not be enough to meet the needs and wants of her family. To help her continue operation of her variety store, she would like to apply for a Php 25,000 loan. She plans to use this money to add more items to her store and keep the small business in shape. In just a small period of time, she intends to turn her small sari-sari store into a real grocery store, with more items to meet the needs of people in her community.\r\n\r\nAll that Leticia dreams of in life is to make her family happy and give them a house they can call their own. She gives her best to make sure her youngest child gets a good education up through college. Life is not always sweet, but with all the efforts she is making for her family, she sees to it that she will emerge a winner, bringing home sweet success.  Leticia faithfully attends weekly fellowship* meetings. \r\n\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":648658,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

you\u2019re a woman looking for shoes, clothing or something to decorate your home or dining room, make sure to stop by Evgeniya\u2019s little store in Nikopol, Ukraine. She offers an attractive array of reasonably priced shoes, clothing, tablecloths and souvenirs. If she doesn\u2019t have what you\u2019re looking for, she can help you find someone who does.\r\n<p>\r\nVendors like Evgeniya form the backbone of a prosperous market economy in Ukraine. These entrepreneurs have, often with little help, been able to start and sustain small businesses which provide enough income for them to live on. For many their goal is to expand by opening new kiosks or renting larger retail space. They may never be the size of Wal-Mart but they\u2019ve started in much the same way. \r\n<p>\r\nEvgeniya has requested a six month loan for $500 which will give her some additional working funds for her business. She believes that God has blessed her through the financial help of \u201cNadiya Ukraine\u201d.

She is 50 years old. Her child is in the basic school. Ama lives with the daughter and husband in a rented apartment in a commercial town called Bekwai, close to Obuasi (a gold mining town) in the Ashanti Region of Ghana. The majority of the inhabitants of Bekwai are into commercial activities. Her husband runs a provisions store, while she is a seamstress by profession.\r\n<p>\r\nShe buys fabrics and other accessories from Kumasi and sews items for sale. She also sews for clients who come with their own materials. She says she procures the materials and sews for people who place orders but pay no deposit amount.

She owns a business venture, catching & selling ocean-caught fish .  Silivia has 7 years of experience in this business.  Silivia needs a loan of WST $2000 to purchase additional fish to raise.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 250 tala or US $104 per week) to make improvements to her house.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Silivia joined SPBD.    This is her 3rd loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Silivia's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Silivia K. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.99 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.99 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.89 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              1.64 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/www.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

She is married and has five children, four of whom are in school.  She also takes care of additional family members.  Sarah has a business of selling charcoal.  She has been in this business for a few years, and she works one day every week.  Sarah sells her products from home, by means of retail.  Sarah has requested a loan of 2,000,000 Ugandan Shillings from MCDT SACCO, which she will use to buy more bags of charcoal.  She also generates additional income through selling sand.  The main business challenge for Sarah is transportation.  Her goals and aspirations for her business are to buy a plot so that she can build rental rooms.  She decided to join MCDT because it was helping poor women to access credit.  Sarah lives in a home that she owns.  She doesn't have access to electricity and doesn't have access to piped water.

To make matooke, get a big pot, put a little water in the bottom, buy a clump of green bananas still on the stem with maybe 100 bananas on the stalk. Everything gets used, so cut the stalk in slices and place in the bottom of the pot and cover with banana leaves. Now peel those green bananas and place them on top of the leaves and cover with more leaves, so that the heat doesn\u2019t escape. Losing heat means wasting charcoal which costs money. Let it simmer for 3-4 hours, remove, mash and presto: matooke!\r\n\r\nBehind Regina is her restaurant where the cooking is always done outside.

She owns a business venture, catching & selling ocean-caught fish .  Eka has 7 years of experience in this business.  Eka needs a loan of WST $1500 to purchase a fishing boat.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 100 tala or US $42 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Eka joined SPBD.    This is her 2nd loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Eka's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Eka S. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.56 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.89 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              1.99 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/www.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

Eleanor also helps care for two of her aunts.\r\n<p>\r\nEleanor's business is making and selling tie-dyed clothes, something she's been doing for four years. She says she started her business with 500 LRD in seed money, and now she operates with 6000 LRD in working capital. She says her enterprise is a success. She also says that she faces difficulty when she allows customers to buy on credit, and they don't pay her back promptly. Eleanor sells the clothes she creates at the Chicken Soup Factory Market in Monrovia, the capital of Liberia.\r\n<p>\r\nWith her 15,000-LRD share of this 95,000-LRD group loan, Eleanor intends to buy more materials to make tie-dyed clothes. She says the colors of her clothes are nice, which is what keeps her customers coming back. She hopes to provide the means for all her children to get a good education.\r\n<p>\r\nIn the photo that accompanies this profile, Eleanor is the one holding the sign.

She hopes to be able to use this loan to purchase a greater quantity of fish in order to get a better discount and increase her profit margin.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, Felicita raises animals in the yard behind the home she shares with her sisters. The family raises these animals on rice chaff and local grasses until they are large enough to sell for their meat.\r\n\r\nFelicita currently has no loans outstanding and has good references within the community.

At this time, she is working hard to be able to send her children all the way through college.

She sells branded cosmetics, apparel, footwear, household detergents, and other personal products. She allows her customers to order from her based on a product catalog, then orders these items from the company office at a discounted price. Monthly, Teresita earns an estimated net income of around 11,000 Philippine pesos (PHP). \r\n\r\nTo help her continue the operation of her business, she is requesting an 18,000 PHP loan. She plans to use this loan to buy items ordered in advance by her customers like cosmetics and apparels. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nTeresita dreams of being able to give all of her children a good and high-quality education through all of her hard work in her business. She prays that her business will become successful and aims for financial stability someday. As a CCT community partner, she faithfully attends the group's weekly fellowship meeting* where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies. \r\n\r\n*All CCT community members are organized into fellowship groups composed of 15 to 30 community partners that meet on a weekly basis. The fellowship groups gather to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance loans.

With the profits from this season\u2019s harvest, she plans to send her children to school.\r\n\r\nWith this loan, Getrede\u2019s Group will be able to plant a total of 8.25 acres of land and purchase a total of six solar lights.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n"}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1794404,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Green","Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to purchase a solar light and gain access to cost-efficient hybrid seeds and fertilizer for maize cultivation.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Webuye","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.616667 34.766667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1275,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Getrede","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Edith","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"George","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Richard","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alice","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Florence","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"William","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Brandson","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ebby","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Doricus","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gostine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-28T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":115600,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":1275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":115600}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1275}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Margaret Rosen","image":null}},{"id":985434,"name":"Barrio San Antonio Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"The people of Santa Mar\u00eda Visitaci\u00f3n have very rich cultural traditions that make them very proud; the colorful dress of the women is ornate and beautiful. It consists of a woven and embroidered rectangular blouse called a \u201chuipil\u201d (wee-peel), wrap around woven skirt or \u201ccorte\u201d and an embroidered and woven belt called a \u201cfaja\u201d. The predominant languages are the indigenous language of K\u2019ich\u00e9 and Spanish. \n\nThe Friendship Bridge Trust Bank \u201cBarrio San Antonio\u201d is located here and is composed of seven entrepreneurial women. Julia, who is a member of the Trust Bank, is 42 years old and has been married for 20 years; she has five children who range in age from 7-18. Julia is working hard so that each of her children can have formal education since she realizes how important it is. She was only able to study until the 6th grade. She is empowered, motivated and appreciates her loan that she is going to use in her beekeeping and textile businesses. She raises bees, as well as embroiders and weaves the traditional \u201chuipiles\u201d of her town. Julia also distributes natural medicines to sick children in her area. She is requesting a loan to buy a number of supplies for her textile business including thread, wool, silk, and other needed supplies. She wants to have plenty of raw materials for her textile treasures, especially at this time of the year. Julia has utilized part of her income to purchase a plot of land, repair and expand her home, buy a computer and most importantly, send her children to school.\n \nThe ladies look forward to their monthly meetings when they have the opportunity to socialize, make payments on their loans and participate in educational trainings conducted by a Facilitator from Friendship Bridge. A specific topic is covered at each meeting and the Facilitator uses games, role playing, pictures and diagrams to share the information. Most of the women have had little or no formal education. \n\nJulia is especially grateful to be a member of the Trust Bank since she is the sole provider for her children. Several years ago, her husband became ill and was unable to work.  She had to assume a leadership role in their home. \n\nThank you, KIVA investors, for believing that Julia and her friends in the Trust Bank have the capacity to progress and create more prosperous lives for themselves, their families and their community!\n"}},"status":"inactive","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":2026848,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Weaving","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"To buy supplies for her textile business including thread, wool, silk, and other needed supplies","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GT","country":"Guatemala","town":"Santa Maria Visitacion, Solol\u00e1","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15.5 -90.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":55,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":4725,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juliana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Francisca Cipriana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Andrea Yesenia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Evelin Marleni ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juana Luisa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Simona Tomasa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Clara Victoria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-11-10T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GTQ","disbursal_amount":36000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":4725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":3003},{"due_date":"2016-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":3003},{"due_date":"2016-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":3003},{"due_date":"2016-03-09T08:00:00Z","amount":3003},{"due_date":"2016-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":3003},{"due_date":"2016-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":3003},{"due_date":"2016-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":3003},{"due_date":"2016-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":3003},{"due_date":"2016-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":3003},{"due_date":"2016-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":3003},{"due_date":"2016-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":3003},{"due_date":"2016-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":2967}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":394.15},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":394.15},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":394.15},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":394.15},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":394.14},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":394.14},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":394.14},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":394.14},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":394.14},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":394.14},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":394.14},{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":389.42}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":993627,"name":"Ria","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rai is a villager of Stoeng Sen district where crop farming is the common way to earn a living.

In their loan application, the group described their business as follows:<p>\r\n\r\n\u201cIn spite of the countless social difficulties that arise from the disastrous economic situation, the village of Diourbel has kept alive its ancient tradition of producing tourgui ndiareme textiles.  Although the women of Diourbel have been severely affected by the economic hardship, they jealously guard the secrets of weaving these small wrap outfits, which are highly prized by both locals and outsiders.  With the recent acceleration in migration out of rural areas, women occupy a strategic position in the area of clothing production and other crafts.  These products are easily marketed thanks to the numerous loumas (weekly markets) and Diourbel's proximity to the holy city of Touba, which attracts enormous crowds in its seasonal pilgrimages.  This has been a boon to the women who supplement their families' incomes with local trading activities.  In order to strengthen these activities, the members of our group always need to augment their available stock so that they can ensure continuous and diversified production.  Since many women compete in this market, the members of our group also plan to introduce the sale of finished products purchased in other loumas.\u201d <p>\r\n\r\nBackground\r\n<p>\r\nSenegal is one of the world\u2019s poorest countries, yet its solid democratic tradition and highly developed associational life distinguish it from other countries in its income group. Especially remarkable are Senegal\u2019s networks of rotating savings and credit associations, known as tontines. Commonly organized by groups of twenty to thirty housewives who live in the same village, the tontines provide poor women throughout the country with small loans to finance modest income-generating activities. Repayment rates within these associations are excellent, because they are based on local reputation and personal trust between the members. However, their financial resources are limited to the contributions of their members, frequently subsistence farmers with very little disposable income. This has prevented the traditional tontines from meeting the demand for rural microenterprise loans and restricted their impact on the economic development of their communities. The SEM Fund works to bridge this gap by linking traditional village credit associations with outside sources of finance.\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n<p> <b> Business description translated from French by Senegal Ecovillage Microfinance Fund. <\/b>\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n\u00abDIOURBEL malgr\u00e9 les multiples probl\u00e8mes sociaux li\u00e9s \u00e0 la situation \u00e9conomique d\u00e9sastreuse a gard\u00e9 une veille tradition dans le domaine du textile et de la confection (tourgui ndiar\u00e8me).

Because customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets, the women lack tangible collateral assets, and financial institutions do not consider them to be credit-worthy. This leads to poor financial support and, as a result, limited access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.<\/P>\r\n\r\n<P>SELFINA buys and leases equipment to women. When a client needs working capital, SELFINA buys the equipment from the client, extends a loan to her, and then leases back the same equipment \u2013 a process called a \"sale and leaseback\" arrangement.<\/P>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":152095,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Butcher Shop","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To purchase a motorbike to pick up supplies and make deliveries to customers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Kyela","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-9.583333 33.85","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-04-23T15:30:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":575,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ruth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-05-07T21:02:23Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":700000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":70000},{"due_date":"2008-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":70000},{"due_date":"2008-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":70000},{"due_date":"2008-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":70000},{"due_date":"2008-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":70000},{"due_date":"2008-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":70000},{"due_date":"2008-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":70000},{"due_date":"2009-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":70000},{"due_date":"2009-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":70000},{"due_date":"2009-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":70000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":57.5},{"due_date":"2008-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":57.5},{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":57.5},{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":57.5},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":57.5},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":57.5},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":57.5},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":57.5},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":57.5},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":57.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":58,"local_amount":70608.7,"processed_date":"2008-06-07T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:35:11Z","rounded_local_amount":71456,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":231132},{"amount":58,"local_amount":70608.7,"processed_date":"2008-07-07T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:38:22Z","rounded_local_amount":71456,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":260210},{"amount":58,"local_amount":70608.7,"processed_date":"2008-08-07T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:42:14Z","rounded_local_amount":71456,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":289027},{"amount":58,"local_amount":70608.7,"processed_date":"2008-09-07T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-09-20T07:26:49Z","rounded_local_amount":71456,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":319328},{"amount":58,"local_amount":70608.7,"processed_date":"2008-10-07T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-18T07:20:21Z","rounded_local_amount":71456,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":351366},{"amount":55,"local_amount":66956.5,"processed_date":"2008-11-07T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T03:23:00Z","rounded_local_amount":67759.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5347616},{"amount":57.5,"local_amount":70000,"processed_date":"2008-12-07T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:07:56Z","rounded_local_amount":70840,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9970236},{"amount":57.5,"local_amount":70000,"processed_date":"2009-01-07T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:12:38Z","rounded_local_amount":70840,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14886486},{"amount":57.5,"local_amount":70000,"processed_date":"2009-02-07T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:01:59Z","rounded_local_amount":70840,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20435771},{"amount":57.5,"local_amount":70000,"processed_date":"2009-03-07T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:54:26Z","rounded_local_amount":70840,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130076}],"funded_date":"2008-04-23T21:02:23Z","paid_date":"2009-04-15T21:54:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":49511,"name":"Theong","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Theong L. is a rice farmer in Kampong Cham.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, so they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that it allows clients to use their equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":224976,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To expand her grocery store and hair salon","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mwanza","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.516667 32.9","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-11-13T01:30:27Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Aissa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-11-26T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2008-12-26T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:14:03Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9970758},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-01-25T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:15:19Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14886975},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-02-24T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:03:53Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20436235},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-03-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:56:36Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130507},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-04-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:24:43Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027304},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-05-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:14:30Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613324},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-06-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:01:55Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010407},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-07-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:38:33Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63232718},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-08-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:52:34Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73664534},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-09-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T02:46:10Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87105265}],"funded_date":"2008-11-15T19:08:20Z","paid_date":"2009-10-16T02:46:10Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Susan Olson","image":null}},{"id":78202,"name":"Mumtaz Barkat Ali Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"<p>Mumtaz baji is a 41 year old married woman and resides in Lahore, Pakistan.

She wants to buy these items in advance in order to get a lower price, and to avoid borrowing money from her neighbor during planting season. When she borrows from her neighbor, she usually pays back in rice grains after harvest which is very disadvantageous to her.

She is 42 years old, married, and has three school-aged children. To make a living, Imelda prepares and sells food. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling snacks like bread, chips, fish balls, and other dim sums to the local community. Imelda has been engaged in her business for over two years and earns approximately 4,000 PHP a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Imelda joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Imelda is requesting a loan of 7,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be Imelda's first loan from ASKI.  She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay the tuition fees of her children. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 38 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherpeople, and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":658735,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

She is 44 years old. Daisy is the group leader of a six member group loan offered by ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is Daisy R.'s Group.\r\n\r\nDaisy is married and has 3 school-aged children. To make a living, Daisy owns and operates a business venture in the retail sector running a general store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling a variety of different products in the local community. Daisy has been engaged in her business for over one year and earns approximately 4000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Daisy joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Daisy has successfully repaid a previous loan of 12,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase new items to expand product offering. Daisy is requesting a new loan of 12000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the sixth loan taken out by Daisy from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay the tuition fees of the borrower's children. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines.

Today, BRAC has emerged as an independent, virtually self-financed paradigm in sustainable human development. It is one of the largest Southern development organizations employing over 100,000 people, 61% of which are women, and working with the twin objectives of poverty alleviation and empowerment of the poor. Diagnosing poverty in human terms and recognizing its multifaceted nature, BRAC approaches poverty alleviation with a holistic approach.\r\n<br><br>The successes of BRAC in the international development arena have stimulated a series of discussions, both with African delegations, who have visited BRAC programs, and with donors who work in Asia and Africa. Both the African countries and the donors have encouraged BRAC to join the development campaign in Africa to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and more recently to join the campaign of \u201cending poverty\u201d, which is an area where Africa represents the greatest global challenge.\r\n<br><br> In Uganda, BRAC registered as a Non Government Organization (NGO) in January 2006 to undertake programs in Education, Health, Water & Sanitation, Agriculture & Livestock and Microfinance. The Microfinance and Education are the pioneer programs launched in Uganda and, as of July 2007, had served 21,273 borrowers and enrolled 1,155 adolescents in its education
