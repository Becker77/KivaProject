She and her husband are blessed to have four children.  A member of the Bayugo center of Ahon Sa Hirap, Inc. (ASHI) Rizal East Branch, Elisa is a very industrious woman determined to achieve a better life.  Despite hardships caused by poverty, Elisa remains strong and dedicated in her pursuit to improve her family\u2019s standard of living. The love and support of her husband make her life quite meaningful.\r\n\r\nTo earn a living, Elisa buys and sells fish. She has been engaged in this business for two years. She joined ASHI, a microfinance institution and Kiva partner in the Philippines, in 2005. During the course of her membership, she has been an excellent performer with respect to regular attendance at meetings, loan repayment, and projects. She is now seeking her sixth loan, in the amount of 40,000 PHP, to purchase additional inventory of fish.\r\n\r\nWith access to additional working capital through ASHI and Kiva, Elisa is hopeful that her dreams of sending her children to a university to complete college degrees will be achieved.  She also hopes to build a more durable house made of concrete, and to purchase a car to support her business.  A vehicle will help with customer deliveries and inventory pick-up at the dock.\r\n\r\nElisa\u2019s desire to give her children a brighter future fuels her dedication to her business.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":875,"image":{"id":491204,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish

C. has run a fishing and fish trading business for almost 10 years from the village of Nauring, Pandan in the province of Antique, earning her a reasonable monthly profit. Nancy\u2019s main challenge is her small amount of stock because she only has a small amount of working capital to put into her fishing business. \r\n\r\nShe joined ASHI, a microfinance institution and Kiva partner in the Philippines, in 2003 and is very grateful for secured access to capital and other services such as savings and insurance. Now Nancy wants to request a larger loan for their growing fishing business. Nancy will sell the fish her husband catches in their village and to some people wanting to sell fish in the market. She thinks that commercializing her fishing business and expanding it will enable her to earn more revenue and be able to pay school fees for her children and cater to the other family needs. With access to additional working capital through ASHI and Kiva, Nancy is hopeful her dreams of sending her children to a university to complete college degrees will be achieved. Nancy\u2019s wishes to give her children a brighter future fuel her commitment to her fishing business. \r\n\r\nWith all of her plans for the growth of her business, Nancy would be happier if her children are able to achieve their personal dreams and have their own life out of poverty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":591341,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fishing","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Additional

She earns her living by operating a dried fish vending business and a sari-sari (general) store. Her husband Gregorio, who is 60 years old, helps in his wife's business activities. They have seven children who are 13 to 19 years old. Angelita joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1995 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 17 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Angelita has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 17,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 10,000, thus uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her 18th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 17,000 which she intends to use as additional working capital so that she can continue to save up for the future education of their children. Angelita is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Due to family problems, he lives apart from his partner and cares for their four beloved children.  They live in their own home in the District of Kimbiri in the Department of Cusco.  Honorato is a pillar for his children.  For him there are no obstacles to prevent him from continuing forward and obtaining good benefits out of life.  He must play the role of both father and mother in order to support his family.  When he was a young boy, his parents taught him how to work on a farm.  Honorato is a farmer and has four hectares of land on which he grows pineapples, coffee, and coca leaves.  These crops are native to the tropical region of the Apurimac River Valley.  He has worked on his land for 23 years.  During the harvest season, he has the help of his children and from workers who can pick the fruit with great speed.  What he enjoys most about his job is harvesting the fruit from his plants.  He feels rewarded for the months of hard work whenever his harvest results in quality fruit.  Honarato considers the most difficult part to be transporting his products from the farm to the city of San Francisco, the place that offers the best prices for his products.  \n\nThe loan he is requesting will be used to buy more pineapple seedlings to replace his coffee plants.  Pineapples generate more income and require less time to grow.  Going forward he wants to buy more land so that he can expand his crops and increase production.  This is his second loan with MFP.  He knows that he must submit his payments on time so that he can access another loan more easily and not create complications for his Communal Bank.  The loan of 2000 PEN that he requested will be used to buy more pineapple seedlings in place of coffee so that he can earn more income in less time.  \n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":728352,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To purchase pineapple seedlings.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Chanchamayo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.05 -75.316667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-03-14T22:30:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":725,"lender_count":27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Honorato ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-03-07T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":725}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":725,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:51:16Z","rounded_local_amount":2007.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250835257}],"funded_date":"2011-03-23T02:30:49Z","paid_date":"2012-01-15T10:51:16Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ronan Reodica","image":498323}},{"id":284317,"name":"Rosa Isela","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Rosa Isela C. tiene ya m\u00e1s de un a\u00f1o con su negocio de venta de papeler\u00eda escolar.\nEsta solicitando un pr\u00e9stamo ya que le esta haciendo falta m\u00e1s equipo y mercanc\u00eda, pero no cuenta con el capital necesario para invertir en el negocio y as\u00ed poder satisfacer las necesidades de su clientes.\nPlanea pagar el cr\u00e9dito con las ganancias del negocio, ya que su esposo el se\u00f1or Mauricio Bautista se encargar\u00e1 de los gastos familiares y necesidades de sus tres hijos, con el ingreso que obtiene de su trabajo, como chofer de un cami\u00f3n de carga. \n","en":"Rosa Isela C. has been working for more than a year in her business selling school supplies.

Started in 1972, during the period of the Soviet Union, and with an initial sum of 120 Soviet rubles, this business currently yields about 10,000 so (KGS) per month.  At the present time, Mayrambu's family treats 1.74 hectares of irrigated land, where they grow potatoes and multi-year herbs.  In order to further increase livestock headcount, Mayrambu requested a loan in the sum of 40,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company to purchase additional livestock.  This will help her expand her business and increase livestock headcount and, thus, in her opinion, make a good capital investment."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":875,"image":{"id":918666,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase additional livestock","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Kenesh village","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2011-11-15T20:50:20Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":875,"lender_count":32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mayrambu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-11-14T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":40000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":875,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":3027},{"due_date":"2012-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":2921},{"due_date":"2012-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":3006},{"due_date":"2012-03-09T08:00:00Z","amount":3093},{"due_date":"2012-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":3184},{"due_date":"2012-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":3277},{"due_date":"2012-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":3372},{"due_date":"2012-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":3470},{"due_date":"2012-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":3572},{"due_date":"2012-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":3676},{"due_date":"2012-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":3783},{"due_date":"2012-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":3619}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.22},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.89},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.76},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.66},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.65},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.68},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.77},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.9},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.14},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.41},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":82.75},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":66.22,"local_amount":3027,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T09:29:54Z","rounded_local_amount":3053.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250722517},{"amount":63.89,"local_amount":2921,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T09:41:30Z","rounded_local_amount":2946.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257125449},{"amount":65.76,"local_amount":3006,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T08:43:10Z","rounded_local_amount":3032.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263250601},{"amount":67.66,"local_amount":3093,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T08:39:32Z","rounded_local_amount":3120.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":269975575},{"amount":69.65,"local_amount":3184,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-16T08:15:16Z","rounded_local_amount":3212.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276816148},{"amount":71.68,"local_amount":3277,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T11:07:53Z","rounded_local_amount":3306.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283072169},{"amount":73.77,"local_amount":3372,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T08:30:13Z","rounded_local_amount":3401.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287370748},{"amount":75.9,"local_amount":3470,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T08:57:45Z","rounded_local_amount":3500.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294285417},{"amount":78.14,"local_amount":3572,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:15:27Z","rounded_local_amount":3603.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301339003},{"amount":80.41,"local_amount":3676,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T09:13:09Z","rounded_local_amount":3708.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308095362},{"amount":161.92,"local_amount":7402,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T11:44:02Z","rounded_local_amount":7467.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315329611}],"funded_date":"2011-11-18T03:36:16Z","paid_date":"2012-11-15T11:44:02Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Anna Sorokina","image":null}},{"id":362211,"name":"Cheta A Shg Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Greetings from Cheta A SHG Group in Western Kenya!

This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.

She lives with her husband, a bricklayer, and their children.\r\n\r\nShe got a loan from Kiva because of the problems that she has with inclement weather.  Her house could collapse because of the rains.  The loan is to enlarge her animal corrals.\r\n\r\nYou can see her husband in the photo because she was gathering alfalfa for her cows.\r\n\r\nEmilia is very grateful to Emprender and Kiva for the confidence given in granting the loan.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":491136,"template_id":1},"video":{"id":1712,"youtubeId":"HBFltsLx2zI","title":"Kiva Entrepreneur EMILIA \t\t\t from  Bolivia","thumbnailImageId":491136},"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Increase work capital","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"Cochabamba","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-17.383333 -66.15","type":"point"}},"partner_id":110,"posted_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":725,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Emilia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-01-19T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":5000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":446.05},{"due_date":"2010-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":442.71},{"due_date":"2010-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":442.79},{"due_date":"2010-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":465.98},{"due_date":"2010-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":480.35},{"due_date":"2010-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":503.83},{"due_date":"2010-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":521.03},{"due_date":"2010-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":542.56},{"due_date":"2010-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":564.99},{"due_date":"2010-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":589.71}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.68},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.19},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.2},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.57},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.65},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.06},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.55},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.67},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81.92},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":85.51}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":128.87,"local_amount":888.76,"processed_date":"2010-03-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T08:46:25Z","rounded_local_amount":898.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128936193},{"amount":64.2,"local_amount":442.79,"processed_date":"2010-04-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:10:07Z","rounded_local_amount":447.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136663737},{"amount":67.57,"local_amount":465.98,"processed_date":"2010-05-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:08:02Z","rounded_local_amount":470.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144696543},{"amount":69.65,"local_amount":480.35,"processed_date":"2010-06-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:39:20Z","rounded_local_amount":485.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151879594},{"amount":73.06,"local_amount":503.83,"processed_date":"2010-07-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T10:51:38Z","rounded_local_amount":509.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159619666},{"amount":75.55,"local_amount":521.03,"processed_date":"2010-08-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:03:32Z","rounded_local_amount":526.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166834129},{"amount":78.67,"local_amount":542.56,"processed_date":"2010-09-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T09:57:34Z","rounded_local_amount":548.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172100701},{"amount":81.92,"local_amount":564.99,"processed_date":"2010-10-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T13:39:05Z","rounded_local_amount":571.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177393540},{"amount":85.51,"local_amount":589.71,"processed_date":"2010-11-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T13:48:54Z","rounded_local_amount":595.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182531982}],"funded_date":"2010-03-04T08:52:35Z","paid_date":"2010-12-15T13:48:54Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ginny Kalish"}},{"id":181802,"name":"Faapale","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Faapale T. is 55 and married with 10 children (ages 19 - 35).  She owns a business venture, planting & harvesting fruits & vegetables for sale.  Faapale has many years of experience in this business.  Faapale needs a loan of WST $1000 to purchase harvesting equipment such as wheelbarrows, shovels, rakes, baskets, and knives.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 300 talas or US $125 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Faapale joined SPBD.  This is her 2nd loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Faapale's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Faapale T. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.5 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              1.5 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

Toward the end of the day, she hopes to bring home food for their children and money for their allowance for going to school the next day. \r\n\r\nAfter taking out all of her family expenses, including her weekly payment to ASHI for the loan, from the income they made, Mercy hopes to have some amount leftover to build a savings fund for the future needs of her children in attaining their college degree."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":568287,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish

She lives with her husband in the Santa Clara hamlet of the Pitipo District, an agricultural area which is located in the province of Ferrenafe, about an hour away from the city of Chiclayo.  \r\n\r\nMaria has worked in agriculture alongside with her husband for over fifteen years.  Together they manage a small parcel of cultivations where usually a few grains and vegetables grow.  They also have a small group of cows from which they get their milk from.  With these earnings, they have been able to support their children, the majority of whom are now independent.  \r\n\r\nMaria wishes to acquire a motor that would allow her to pump water from the subsoil in order to be able to water her cultivations during the dry season.  Before, she used to rent one from her neighbor which proved to increase her costs.  As such, she has decided to make this investment so that she can work more effectively.  In order to achieve her goal, she felt it was necessary to seek out a loan of 2000 soles for the first time from Edpyme Alternativa.  Maria is hard-working and dedicated to her family.  Those in the area that know her, consider her an honest and trustworthy woman.  \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":619417,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Purchase a motor that would allow her to pump water from the subsoil.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"P\u00edtipo - Chiclayo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":143,"posted_date":"2010-10-19T04:40:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":725,"lender_count":28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Dominga","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-09-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":4,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":725}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":725,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T13:47:05Z","rounded_local_amount":2018.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182530584}],"funded_date":"2010-10-19T07:38:14Z","paid_date":"2010-12-15T13:47:05Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tracy Quan","image":null}},{"id":243356,"name":"Daniel","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Daniel is a married man with five children, all of whom attend school.

She earns her living by operating two ventures:  a fishing business and a cosmetic dealership. Her husband Rizalito, 43, works as a laborer to earn his living.  <p>\r\n\r\nGenevee joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2007 because she aspired to something better for her family. With the help of her past six loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Genevee has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 15,000 helped her earn a monthly income of PHP 10,300,  uplifting the family's standard of living. She is now requesting a new loan to provide capital for her fishing business and to purchase more cosmetics to sell so that she can continue to save up for future home repairs and the education of her children. Genevee is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. <p>\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams.

One of the members, Ms. Laura Patricia Rodriguez, came to the foundation to learn more about our programs. Currently, this group is in \"strengthening\" process, where every member carries out their own business. They also have a member with a sick child, and they are all helping her. \r\n\r\nMrs. Melanie L., for example, sells clothing by going from house to house.

She normally opens her center on Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays. In addition, she sells food for all tastes, beverages, and soft drinks. Entrance costs a reasonable amount per person.

He is married to Sereya K. and a father of two school-going children. Longisa is a farmer and he has been doing farming for the last ten years and later selling his produce at a profit.\r\n\r\nHe learned about KADET from a friend who is a registered client of KADET in his area of residence.

She makes all kinds of clothes.  She learned these skills from her aunt with whom she lives and works.  Her experience dates back to 2002 when she became interested in this kind of work watching her aunt but only since 2004 that she actually went into it.  Her specialty is athletic wear and recently she acquired as customers local schools that placed an order.  She, therefore, needs to buy fabric to manufacture this line of student athletic clothes.  \r\n\r\nShe also needs to buy a finishing sewing machine that will allow her to improve the quality of her products and surely gain new customers.  This is precisely why she is asking for her first loan from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, an organization she was referred to by a good client of the Fundaci\u00f3n.  Vivian plans to grow hand in hand with it because her goal is to enlarge her workshop to continue improving her quality of life.\r\n\r\nShe currently lacks additional working capital that would help her deepen her involvement with educational institutions and the little capital she works with does not allow her to respond effectively to the real customers she has which are the schools for which she makes sportswear so that the students can participate in athletic activities that are part of the curriculum.\r\n\r\nAnother one of her markets is neighbors for whom she makes dresses because they know her and like the way Vivian makes clothes.  She hopes to make their clothes for the end of year festivities so that they will look elegant and continue to be profit generating customers.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael

He is 40 and married with three children.  He does not have a formal education.  He owns a store that sells food products.  He has been in business for about six years.  However, the store alone doesn't provide enough income for his family, so Mahmurod also raises livestock.  He buys calves and fattens them for 40-45 days, then sells them on at a profit.  This business is popular and well accepted in rural areas and for this reason, brings Mahmurod income.  At the moment, the amount of money he can put into his business has decreased, and he needs to increase the number of calves in his care.  He needs a loan to do this.   This will help Mahmurod re-establish his business and get the income his family needs.

Miguelina and nine of the other women have never received a loan.\r\n<p>\r\nMiguelina used to have a business selling clothes, but decided to go another route because there are a lot of people selling clothes near her.  She wants to start a new business selling shoes for men.  A friend of hers makes shoes and she wants to sell his shoes in her neighborhood, in Puerto Plata.  She also thinks it will be easier to sell shoes to men than clothes to women because men do not take such a long time to make a decision and also pay more (her words).\r\n<p>\r\nMiguelina first heard about Esperanza because some of her family members have already received loans.

It is important to her that she will be able to help her children.  She owns a house in the countrysiD., but lives in a rented house in Puerto Plata.

She lives in her own house together with her family, and cares for them very affectionately.  What she most desires is to give them a better quality of life.  Demetria works selling Andean products.  Her stall is located in the Manco C\u00e1pac market (a large, important market in the city), and she sells potatoes, quinoa, yucca, and other tubers.  She spends the whole day waiting for customers to purchase the products she sells.  She is very happy that her stand is always very busy. What she most enjoys about her job is that she can converse with her customers and have more pleasing sales interactions.  She has worked doing this activity for 23 years and she thinks the hardest part is having to remain all day at her stall to watch over it.  In the future, she wants to have a store where she can sell a larger assortment of Andean products and attend to more customers.  This is Demetria's fifth loan with MFP, and she is willing to divide a part of each day's earnings to pay for the loan without problems.  She is beloved in her community bank, as she brings much happiness to the other members.

He also provides GPS and security camera system installations for other organizations and companies. The 53-year-old computer and electronic services consultant advises clients on what equipment best suits their needs. \r\n\r\nRay has been in the business for 10 years and has received 3 previous loans from ACCION USA. In order to further expand his business, Ray has requested another loan. This loan would allow him hire a temporary worker, add a store-like function to his website, and add money for working capital. Ray is expecting to close a deal soon which would require an extra worker and additional supplies to fulfill the order. \r\n\r\nRay plans to continue expanding his business by partnering with larger companies and expanding his market base. With purchasing options on his website, he expects to gain more customers and boost sales. As his company grows, he will hire more workers and empower the hard-working men and women in his community.\r\n\r\nAbout U.S. Microfinance and ACCION USA\r\n\r\nHave you ever thought about how the new caf\u00e9 on your corner and the delivery service that brings the fresh baked goods acquired the financial resources to start their business? Chances are, they drummed up support from their friends and family, dipped into their personal savings, used a high-interest credit card, or all of the above. An estimated 10 million small businesses in the U.S. face difficulty obtaining loans from traditional banks, even prior to the current \u201ccredit crisis.\u201d Microfinance institutions, like ACCION USA, support these \u201cunbanked\u201d small businesses by giving them access to fairly-priced capital and business education. \r\n\r\nSmall businesses also help stabilize low- to moderate-income neighborhoods and rebuild our economy through income growth and job creation. Self-employment provides workers with a way to increase their incomes, support their families, and strengthen their communities. As unemployment rises in the U.S., more and more people are turning to self-employment and start-up enterprises as a way to take control of their economic futures and provide employment opportunities in their communities. The need for support of small businesses in the U.S. is great, and it is one that ACCION USA has been striving to meet since

Le gusta mucho terminar las obras y ver el gran esfuerzo plasmado en una s\u00f3lida construcci\u00f3n, lo que no le gusta es que su vivienda esta algo alejada de la ciudad, por lo que debe salir todos los d\u00edas desde la madrugada para llegar a tiempo.

After a number of years, this experience has made him a master of construction. Today he works with a friend on large projects, whose engineers hire them temporarily.

clients of Esperanza International for the last three years. They have paid their previous loans on time and have remained together as a group all this time. They think being together in a Bank of Hope has helped them be closer as neighbors and to contribute to their community. \n\nRuth J. is the group coordinator, which means she is responsible for watching out for the well being of the rest of the group members, collecting payments, and being in permanent communication with their loan officer Nelly. She sells clothing and has built a large, faithful clientele. With this loan, she plans to add shoes to her sales, in order to offer this option to her clients who have asked that she start selling shoes. \n\nRuth's health is not very strong. She gets sick rather easily and this keeps her away from her clients for extended periods of time. She hopes that during the time she is healthy, she can sell enough to attend her sickness with proper medical attention. Her dream is to travel to the United States someday as a tourist.\n \nPlease help us support the hopes and dreams of these entrepreneurs.

Restaurants in Cameroon can be as small as a menu with three items and a couple of benches under an overhang. Veronica\u2019s restaurant is just that way. With this loan, she plans to buy food to serve: cocoyams, corn, rice, beans, palm oil, groundnut (peanut) oil, flashes (matches), groundnut, meat, fish and spices. She will also use the loan to pay for transportation costs associated with her business.\r\n<p>\r\nThis is Veronica\u2019s second loan from GHAPE since she became a beneficiary in 2007. Her first loan from GHAPE was used much in the same way, investing in her business. She has seen success from her past experiences, and knows how to alter her business practices when there is a failure, she says.\r\n<p>\r\nVeronica has struggled with living in poor conditions and not always having enough money for things like her children's school fees or house rent. With the profits from this loan, she plans to pay for food for the family and her children's school fees, as well as save money for medical fees. Veronica chooses GHAPE loans because unlike her other options, like loan sharks or private groups, she pays her loan back little by little without fear of being chased down.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>About GHAPE<\/b>\r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon. GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach. Every client is trained in business management, basic health, life skills, financial management, profits and losses, and family values. Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement. GHAPE instills a sense of family and community within its clients and staff and has developed a strong bond of trust between the organization and its clients.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":316842,"template_id":1},"video":{"id":382,"youtubeId":"GyOssu8TLWQ","title":"Kiva Entrepreneur Veronica from  Cameroon","thumbnailImageId":316842},"activity":"Restaurant","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To buy cocoyams, corn, rice, palm oil, groundnuts and other supplied for her restaurant.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CM","country":"Cameroon","town":"Ntamulung, Bamenda, NW.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.<P>\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<P>\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

This previous loan was used to to purchase additional seeds and seedlings to raise. Rosalina is requesting a new loan of 30,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase fertilizers such as manure. This loan will be the fifth loan taken out by Rosalina from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three units offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte, and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolk, and small business entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":649534,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To purchase fertilizers such as manure for her rice field","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Campo 4, Ramon MAgsaysay Zamboanga Del Sur","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":136,"posted_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:26Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":700,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosalina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-11-18T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":30000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":30000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":700}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":700,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:23:01Z","rounded_local_amount":30590,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211235074}],"funded_date":"2010-12-01T13:42:37Z","paid_date":"2011-06-15T11:23:01Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Maeve","image":1271729}},{"id":255698,"name":"Darling Maribel","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Darling Maribel, tiene 38 a\u00f1os su actividad es la venta de cosm\u00e9ticos.

This is the third time that she has taken a loan to strengthen her business and she is grateful for the opportunity.

They live in Pampahasi which is located 20 minutes from the city centre of La Paz. His youngest son, who is still a minor, works as a driver for the local union. Sr. Profirio is a cobbler and makes boots and ankle boots for women in a small workshop he has at home. Don Porfirio used to work at a factory where he learned to make these shoes and he has had his own workshop for several years now.

Mehri's son works as an Information Systems Specialist at a factory.  His salary is 700 somoni, and because Mehri does not have a husband (divorced), he fully supports his mother with family expenses.  Because Mehri married off her daughter this year, she has not yet married off her son, but has plans to hold a wedding at the beginning of spring.  Mehri works as a salesperson at a store, and the owner pays her 600 somoni ($123) per month, which gives her an opportunity to repay this loan without any issues."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":952608,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Purchases","sector":"Personal Use","themes":null,"use":"to purchase furniture","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Khujand","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"40.28 69.631667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2011-12-23T20:00:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mehri","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-12-16T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":171.35},{"due_date":"2012-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":177.16},{"due_date":"2012-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":183.16},{"due_date":"2012-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":189.37},{"due_date":"2012-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":195.79},{"due_date":"2012-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":202.43},{"due_date":"2012-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":209.29},{"due_date":"2012-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":216.39},{"due_date":"2012-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":223.72},{"due_date":"2012-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":231.34}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.41},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.65},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.92},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.24},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.61},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.01},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.48},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.98},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.54},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.16}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":36.41,"local_amount":171.35,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:27:03Z","rounded_local_amount":173.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263381614},{"amount":37.65,"local_amount":177.16,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:25:32Z","rounded_local_amount":179.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270095130},{"amount":38.92,"local_amount":183.16,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-16T08:55:32Z","rounded_local_amount":185.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276919590},{"amount":40.24,"local_amount":189.37,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:26:34Z","rounded_local_amount":191.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283197609},{"amount":41.61,"local_amount":195.79,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:46:41Z","rounded_local_amount":197.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287197275},{"amount":43.01,"local_amount":202.43,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:09:31Z","rounded_local_amount":204.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294397329},{"amount":44.48,"local_amount":209.29,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:52:49Z","rounded_local_amount":211.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301452171},{"amount":45.98,"local_amount":216.39,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T10:31:29Z","rounded_local_amount":218.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308212438},{"amount":96.7,"local_amount":455.06,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T14:30:26Z","rounded_local_amount":460.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315443190}],"funded_date":"2011-12-26T15:47:11Z","paid_date":"2012-11-15T14:30:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Anna Sorokina","image":null}},{"id":378663,"name":"Chhang","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Chhang is 47 years old and the mother of three children who lives in the Baray district.

Right now, she travels each Thursday to the nearby city of Santiago to buy shirts, pants, skirts, and blouses to sell in the streets of her local community, Amistad, which means friendship.

The concept of this group bank paying their loan together is to reduce the risk of one person defaulting, as the others members gladly help cover one another\u2019s payments in order to receive their next loan together.  Many of the women in this bank have businesses similar to Monise\u2019s, selling clothing in the streets, while several others sell vegetables in the street, and some even maintain a personal hair salon.\r\n<p>\r\nOn behalf of Monise, the Movimiento Group Bank, and the entire team here at Esperanza International, we thank you for your support and awareness of the global issue of poverty, in which your efforts are helping to make a difference."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4750,"image":{"id":174387,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"To purchase shoes, shirts, skirts, pants, and undergarments","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"DO","country":"Dominican Republic","town":"Puerto Plata","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"19.75 -70.75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":44,"posted_date":"2008-07-01T16:20:19Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":4750,"lender_count":136,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Monise","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Karina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Cleanise","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yhislaine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marie","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lucianna","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Phanette","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Aracelis","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mireille","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fleurette","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mimose","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yolande","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Catiana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Anna","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Linda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-08-10T12:57:46Z","disbursal_currency":"DOP","disbursal_amount":161000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":4750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":26833.33},{"due_date":"2008-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":26833.33},{"due_date":"2008-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":26833.33},{"due_date":"2008-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":26833.33},{"due_date":"2009-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":26833.33},{"due_date":"2009-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":26833.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":791.67},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":791.67},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":791.67},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":791.67},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":791.67},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":791.65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":792,"local_amount":26844.63,"processed_date":"2008-09-10T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-09-11T07:16:35Z","rounded_local_amount":26948.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322224},{"amount":792,"local_amount":26844.63,"processed_date":"2008-10-10T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-11T07:08:53Z","rounded_local_amount":26948.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":354561},{"amount":791,"local_amount":26810.73,"processed_date":"2008-11-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-16T02:54:48Z","rounded_local_amount":26914.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5312767},{"amount":791.67,"local_amount":26833.33,"processed_date":"2008-12-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-15T20:16:44Z","rounded_local_amount":26937.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9930314},{"amount":791.67,"local_amount":26833.33,"processed_date":"2009-01-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T11:47:52Z","rounded_local_amount":26937.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14854888},{"amount":791.66,"local_amount":26833.35,"processed_date":"2009-02-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T08:09:04Z","rounded_local_amount":26937.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20394177}],"funded_date":"2008-07-27T12:57:46Z","paid_date":"2009-03-16T08:09:04Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":58187,"name":"Son","description":{"languages":["vi"],"texts":{"vi":"<p> As Mr. Son\u2019s family doesn\u2019t have enough space for agricultural activities, they make a living by working for people in the area.

In one harvest season (around 4 month period) he can only get a profit of IDR 500 thousand (around USD 45). That was certainly not enough to make a living especially in this current economic condition.<p>\r\nHe applied for a loan from Dinari foundation for an amount of IDR 6 million (around USD 550). He used IDR 3 million (USD 275) to buy high quality paddy seeds, another IDR 1 million (USD 92) was spent for hiring some men to clear and work the land, and IDR 2 million (USD 183) to buy fertilizer and pesticide.<p>\r\nI Ketut Sada has learned from senior farmers in farming with high quality seeds, hence he is confidence he can succeed this time.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":336883,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Office Supplies","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To purchase stationery items in bulk.

He lives with his wife, who works in the home, and his two small daughters, 4 and 6 years old respectively, who are both studying. Pedro is a hard-working man who puts for a great effort to provide for his family and improve his life. He works selling bottled water, juices, and sodas, which he sells in the heavily trafficked areas in the center of Soyapango. During the course of the day Pedro sells in different locations like the areas outside of malls, markets, and high schools depending on the best time to sell his products. Pedro is applying for the loan in order to buy the products he sells wholesale as well as a cooler big enough to put all his drinks inside and ice. Even though Pedro has a very humble job he is able to earn enough to support his family. This is why he works so hard moving from location to location in order to earn more money and provide for his family.  \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Patrick King, Kiva
