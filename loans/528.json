Tagasa, Brgy. Bitoon, Daanbantayan, Cebu. She earns her living by operating a fishing  business.  Her husband, Cesario T., aged 40, is a fisherman, and works with Nenita to earn a living for their family. They have five children who are aged between five and 20 years. The two older ones have started working and the two youngest ones are currently going to school. \r\n\r\nNenita joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2007 because she aspired to something better for her family. With the help of her past four loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, she has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 10,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 2,000, uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her fifth cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 11,000 which she intends to use to pay for repair work on her fishing boat and minor house repairs. \r\n\r\nShe hopes to earn enough so that she can continue to save up for her children's future education and have enough to invest in other business activities such as poultry and livestock-raising.  Nenita T. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means 'Honorable'). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed on a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work. \r\n\r\nHelp NWTF continue its mission to help the poorest in the Philippines by clicking the link to the NWTF Kiva lending team on Kiva.org to join our

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History \r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

children. This area is a nascent tourist zone, surrounded by the Atlantic ocean and mountains, rivers and natural breezes. Paula says her most important challenge is to keep her business stable and sustainable. She enjoys working and serving the needs of her family and friends.\r\n\r\nPaula is receiving her 9th loan with Esperanza Internacional, after having successfully paid all her previous loans, and after 5 years of investments, she is ready for higher loans and bigger investments. She will invest in this loan by purchasing different clothes like pants, skirts, blouses, and shirts, and she also wants to sell shoes. With her business profits she will reinvest in her business, because Christmas season is coming and all the businesses make better sales.\r\n\r\nIn the future, with her savings and profits, she is planning to have a better clothing store and a better house.\r\n \r\nThanks for supporting this group of entrepreneurs!

Ben\u00edtes is 50 years old and lives on Los Incas 325 Avenue in the Mache district of La Libertad, Per\u00fa.  She completed her primary school education, but did not continue her studies given that her parents thought she\u2019d received enough schooling.  They preferred educating their sons, as they would be serving their country.  She married at 23 years of age, and had three children.  One of her children is still in school, while the other two are now working. <p>\r\n\r\nShe started her business buying animals and selling their meat which, she tells us, is how she generated greater income for herself.  She received a first loan of 300.00 soles from Manuela Ramos, with which she bought animals.  She repaid the loan in four months.  With this loan from Manuela for 1,000.00 soles, she will buy a calf whose meat she will then sell.  She belongs to the Coraz\u00f3n de Mar\u00eda dining hall, to the Parents Association at her son\u2019s school, and to the communal bank Progresistas.  She serves as Treasurer at all three institutions.  She dreams of traveling and getting to know other areas of Per\u00fa and the world. <p>\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Mary Lynn Malaby, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":204904,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Butcher Shop","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Purchase of a calf.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Mache - La Libertad","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.033333 -78.533333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":72,"posted_date":"2008-09-23T14:20:36Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jes\u00fas Enma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-10-07T15:36:44Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2008-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2008-11-07T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-16T07:55:39Z","rounded_local_amount":262.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5330896},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2008-12-07T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T00:43:04Z","rounded_local_amount":262.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9951266},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-01-07T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T13:41:15Z","rounded_local_amount":262.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":10224293},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-02-07T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T19:44:44Z","rounded_local_amount":262.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20417025}],"funded_date":"2008-09-23T15:36:44Z","paid_date":"2009-03-16T19:44:44Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":70122,"name":"Chailim","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Chailim S., 36, and her husband, Mr. Srun Chum, 36, live in a small village across the Mekong River about twenty kilometers from Phnom Penh.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 300 talas or US $125 per week) to improve\/expand the business.  \r\n\r\nIn 2009, Luluofe joined SPBD to gain access to financial services.  Most of SPBD's clients are unable to borrow from commercial banks, because they lack collateral.  This is Luluofe's 1st loan with SPBD. \r\n\r\nIn addition, SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress.  The overall social metric score is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation.  A higher number represents a higher score.  For example, a \"3 out of 3\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"2 out of 3\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"1 out of 3\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.  \r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nLuluofe's Overall Social Metric Score:               1.6 out of 3\r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.

Remegia is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the fifth loan taken out by Remegia from HSPFI.

For her, the skill was a family tradition she perfected over years of practice and study, along the way making a bit of a name for herself in the neighborhood, thanks to the high quality of her work. \r\n\r\nLucy came to Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo one year ago and has now applied for her second loan, this time with Kiva, that she plans to use to buy primary materials such as fabrics, thread, and buttons to turn into dresses based on her clients' measurements. Since she started with FMSD, Lucy has bought her materials in an efficient manner, without needing to maintain a special inventory that could potentially deteriorate over time in the humid climate. \r\n\r\nLucy's biggest challenge is that her workspace is cramped and is located within her family's home (a condition which currently leads to longer work days than she'd prefer). She dreams of setting up a workshop completely separate from her home so as to put a bit of space between her professional and personal lives. She also envisions her children (aged 15 and 21) becoming professionals and for that reason she and her husband work hard to encourage and finance their studies. \r\n\r\n[EN ESPANOL]\r\nLucy S.

Desde que ella accedi\u00f3 a cr\u00e9ditos con esta organizaci\u00f3n compra de manera eficiente, sin necesidad de mantener un Stock de inventarios que puedan deteriorarse, porque ahora se ha organizado en este sentido.\r\nSu sue\u00f1o m\u00e1s importante es establecer un taller totalmente separado de su medio familiar, para no mezclar sus responsabilidades productivas y domesticas y  muchas veces extender sus  jornadas de trabajo. Igualmente visiona a sus hijos de 21 y 15 a\u00f1os como unos profesionales de calidad y por eso ella con su c\u00f3nyuge trabajan persistentemente para conseguir esta meta. Su mayor desaf\u00edo es lograr alg\u00fan d\u00eda tener un amplio local donde establecer su taller, porque el que actualmente tiene es muy estrecho.\r\n

Tabagak, Madredijos, Cebu City. She earns her living by operating three business ventures: hog raising, water supply and fishing businesses. She has four children who are aged between 33 and 39. Beviana joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1999 because she aspired to something better for her family. \r\n\r\nWith the help of her past 19 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Beviana has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 29,500 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 3,000, uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her 20th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 29,500 which she intends to use to purchase more pigs to raise and rice for her business so that she can continue to save up for her future plans of buying a small piece of land where she intends to put up a sari-sari (general) store. Beviana G. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means 'Honorable'). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed on a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Hugo lives alone; he has been separated from his wife for some time and has a daughter he can't see due to time constraints. Currently, he lives in anticresis (an arrangement in Bolivia where a fixed sum is paid at the start of tenancy instead of monthly rent) with his sister and his niece. He will use the loan to purchase a router that will optimize his work, since currently he does the work manually with a metal knife. His biggest dream is to give the best to his daughter, since she is the one he is working for."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":853308,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Arts","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"to purchase

She is married and has four children, two of whom are currently in school. For the past fifteen years, Anna has been working hard to manage her bar which serves drinks and sodas to local customers. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Anna has requested a loan of 2,000,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more crates of beer and soda, and will help Anna to generate greater profits and pay school fees for her children. Anna hopes that in the future she will be able to open another bar. \r\n\r\nAnna is a member of BRAC's Small Enterprise Program (SEP).  The program primarily serves small entrepreneurs like Anna who do not have enough collateral for commercial loans, but have businesses that have grown too large for

She lives with her partner, Kiker, who drives a moto-taxi.  They live in their own home with their children who are 12 and 5 years old.  Betty works selling soft drinks and ice in small bars.  She has a refrigerator for this business that she and her husband bought.  A need for more money led them to start this business.  There is now a lot of demand because the climate is very hot.  She has worked alone attending to the customers for six years.  She likes the work because it gives her an income to help her husband with the expenses of the home, and it also lets her be home to care for her children, whom she loves a lot and wishes to help succeed.  For this reason she has plans to expand her business and open a business selling food from her home, because she has seen that she lives in a good area for this type of sales.  This will be her third loan with MFP, and she is hopeful that with their help, she can continue meeting her goals.

Today, BRAC has emerged as an independent, virtually self-financed paradigm in sustainable human development. It is one of the largest Southern development organizations employing over 100,000 people, 61% of which are women, and working with the twin objectives of poverty alleviation and empowerment of the poor. Diagnosing poverty in human terms and recognizing its multifaceted nature, BRAC approaches poverty alleviation with a holistic approach.\r\n<br><br>The successes of BRAC in the international development arena have stimulated a series of discussions, both with African delegations, who have visited BRAC programs, and with donors who work in Asia and Africa. Both the African countries and the donors have encouraged BRAC to join the development campaign in Africa to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and more recently to join the campaign of \u201cending poverty\u201d, which is an area where Africa represents the greatest global challenge.\r\n<br><br> In Uganda, BRAC registered as a Non Government Organization (NGO) in January 2006 to undertake programs in Education, Health, Water & Sanitation, Agriculture & Livestock and Microfinance. The Microfinance and Education are the pioneer programs launched in Uganda and, as of July 2007, had served 21,273 borrowers and enrolled 1,155 adolescents in its education

In 2005, Magreth established her hair salon business. Magreth has already received and successfully repaid one loan from SELFINA, and now requires a new loan in order to buy more  cosmetics and different hair fashions. She thanks you for your support.  \r\n\r\n\r\nSELFINA is engaged in economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through leasing and leaseback facility as a practical way to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women.\r\n\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing.

She is thinking of renting a storefront that is more centrally located to store her wood in.  Right now she has to leave it on the street and every time it rains, the wood gets wet , which makes it more difficult to sell.

For 5 years he has been dedicated to the sale of shoes, motivated to initiate this business by a friend who used to travel to other cities and bring back shoes to distribute in the markets in their area. So, Artemio fancied working like this, resulting in a very profitable business. But, everything didn't work out well, as this associate, a while ago, defrauded him, taking a large part of the profits. Artemio wasn't daunted by this and continued moving forward, converting it into a prosperous shoe business, which he likes very much and has acquired much experience in, and also with his conviction has been able to attract an asiduous clientele to his stand. His wish is to grow his business and he hopes to soon have a large shop where he can sell with greater comfort, as his stand where he sells now, when there is occasional bad weather, means his shoes become powdery and don't look attractive. This is his third loan with Microfinanzas PRISMA and now he is very content with his group, as all his companions are very friendly and fun, but above all, very punctual with their payments.

Ankhtuya has a small dairy product trading business that she operates out of a rented stall at the local market in her town. She obtains her products by traveling to the countryside and buying from local herders. Ankhtuya started her dairy product trading business in 1996 with an investment of 50,000 tugrugs (~34 USD). Due to her hard work, friendly nature and good customer service, the business has been growing steadily and she has established a good reputation in her community. Today, her working capital exceeds 300,000 tugrugs (~200 USD). Ankhtuya hopes to use future profits from the business to save for her daughter's education.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nTajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged an already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve agricultural production and the manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still lives in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\nIMON's History\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

She owns a business venture, planting & harvesting bananas for sale.  Samalaulu has 6 years of experience in this business.  Samalaulu needs a loan of WST $2000 to purchase weed-killers such as Gramoxome.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 450 talas or US $188 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Samalaulu joined SPBD.    This is her 3rd loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Samalaulu's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Samalaulu F. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.6 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                         1.4 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:            1.8 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:                2.3 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\"\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

Desde hace 2 a\u00f1os, empez\u00f3 con el negocio de venta de relojes, accesorios para mujer y adornos para el hogar. Al principio no fue f\u00e1cil porque sola buscaba a sus compradores, pero en la actualidad solo trae pedidos a sus clientes, les deja en sus casas o negocios y les brinda su mercader\u00eda a cr\u00e9dito, es por esta raz\u00f3n que obtiene regulares ganancias ya que ofrece a mayor precio del real. Esta muy satisfecha pues es un trabajo tranquilo que le permite continuar con las labores del hogar y no descuidar la crianza de sus hijos; lo que no le gusta es cuando sus clientes se atrasen en pagar en la fecha que quedaron y eso le genera atrasos en los pagos.

They struggle daily together to get ahead seeking progress.  Two years ago she started selling watches, women\u2019s accessories and home decorations.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning it wasn\u2019t easy because she would seek customers by herself but currently she fills orders for customers that she delivers to their homes or work places and that she sells on credit.  This is how she earns steady profits because she sells slightly higher than the real price.

She lives independently in her parents' home and longs to be able to give her beloved son a good occupation.  Nora walks around the Tupac Amaru market (an important market in the city of Juliaca) selling CDs from a small cart she transports all her stock, covering the entire market in search of customers to buy her CDs.  She has lower prices than other vendors and because of this many people prefer to buy from her.  Nora longs to have a little stall in the market where she can sell her goods without having to walk so much as that is what she likes the least about her work.  She has been in this business for 10 years and she enjoys speaking with her clients whom she always treats pleasantly and always convinces to buy a CD.  Nora has already had five loans from MFP and has repaid all of them on time because she wants to continue to receive loans.  She is well respected by her community bank because she is one of the members of longest standing.  She will use the loan to buy more CDs to increase her stock, which will cost her roughly 500 soles; with the rest of the monies she will make improvements to her cart and buy some items to help her sell better.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Laure Kwon, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":275795,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Movie Tapes & DVDs","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To increase her stock of CDs","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Juliaca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15.5 -70.133333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-02-21T01:40:11Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nora","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-02-13T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":165}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":54.28},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.28},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.28},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.28},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.28},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.6}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":54.28,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-03-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:38:18Z","rounded_local_amount":177.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27117133},{"amount":54.27,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-04-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:46:50Z","rounded_local_amount":177.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36012046},{"amount":54.27,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T00:58:14Z","rounded_local_amount":177.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44595632},{"amount":54.27,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-06-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:41:56Z","rounded_local_amount":177.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52989893},{"amount":54.31,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-07-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:42:50Z","rounded_local_amount":177.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63211025},{"amount":53.6,"local_amount":165,"processed_date":"2009-08-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:22:13Z","rounded_local_amount":175.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73640522}],"funded_date":"2009-02-21T08:15:46Z","paid_date":"2009-09-15T19:22:13Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"L K","image":355766}},{"id":94730,"name":"Rin","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rin R. is 39 years old and resides with her husband in Siem Reap, Cambodia.

SPBD's loans are Solotua's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Solotua T. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.4 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.3 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.4 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              1.4 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\"\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

She chose this business because agricultural production is the main economic opportunity in Arapy.  She wants a loan to purchase fuel for the wheat harvest and for cattle feed.  Aghavni expects this expansion of her business to increase the family income by 25%.  With these funds she will be able to pay the tuition fees for her children\u2019s education.

The official name of this borrowing group is Elonita S. group.\r\n\r\nElonita is single. To make a living, Elonita owns and operates a business venture in the retail sector running a general store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from selling a variety of different products in the local community. Elonita has been engaged in her business for over 10 years and earns approximately 3500 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Elonita joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Elonita has successfully repaid a previous loan of 7000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Elonita is requesting a new loan of 10000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the third loan taken out by Elonita from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand the borrower's business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines.

Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Today, BRAC has emerged as an independent, virtually self-financed paradigm in sustainable human development. It is one of the largest Southern development organizations employing over 100,000 people, 61% of which are women, and working with the twin objectives of poverty alleviation and empowerment of the poor. Diagnosing poverty in human terms and recognizing its multifaceted nature, BRAC approaches poverty alleviation with a holistic approach.\r\n<br><br>The successes of BRAC in the international development arena have stimulated a series of discussions, both with African delegations, who have visited BRAC programs, and with donors who work in Asia and Africa. Both the African countries and the donors have encouraged BRAC to join the development campaign in Africa to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and more recently to join the campaign of \u201cending poverty\u201d, which is an area where Africa represents the greatest global challenge.\r\n<br><br> In Uganda, BRAC registered as a Non Government Organization (NGO) in January 2006 to undertake programs in Education, Health, Water & Sanitation, Agriculture & Livestock and Microfinance. The Microfinance and Education are the pioneer programs launched in Uganda and, as of July 2007, had served 21,273 borrowers and enrolled 1,155 adolescents in its education

When it comes to family life, success depends on how each partner cooperates and supports the other in all endeavors. \r\n<p>\r\nRosalie P. has always been open to new opportunities that come her way, especially in business. She is always on the lookout for new possibilities where she could use her skills and business acumen. Because she is not afraid to work hard to achieve her goals, she has already accomplished a lot in her 46 years. \r\n<p>\r\nRosalie is married to Pedrito, who is a councilor in their village. Even though he is active in local politics, Pedrito is also an active partner in their hollow blocks factory. \r\n<p>\r\nThey have four children. The two older ones have already earned their college degrees, and the younger kids are still in school. Rosalie's immediate aspiration is for her two remaining children to finish their studies and for their hollow blocks factory to continue to flourish, enabling them to provide employment to more people in their community in Brgy. Cabatangan, Talisay City, Negros Occidental.\r\n<p>\r\nRosalie's financial situation today is so much improved from her life years ago. Her first business was a &quot;sari-sari&quot; or general store where she sold just a few items. She was very frugal in budgeting her income, making sure that she set aside some of the income to increase her working capital, but she realized that she could not expand her business if she did not have access to outside capital. This is why she joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in June of 2002. With the additional capital, she was able to increase her income capacity by adding more items to her goods for sale. Later, she also started selling Ready-to-Wear clothes, and then added a Water Refilling Station to her roster of services. With the additional businesses, she hired people to help her in the business. \r\n<p>\r\nWhen she was given the opportunity to start a Hollow Blocks Factory, she did not hesitate, because she knew that this would not only help her family, but also provide work opportunities for people in their village. All her business activities now earn a minimum of $293 a month. She saves most of her income for the education of her children and their household expenses. In her previous loan she borrowed 35,000 PHP which she used as working capital for her business ventures. Now that she is into her next loan cycle, she wants to borrow 38,000 PHP so that she can buy another hollow-blocks machine and increase her production capacity.\r\n<p>\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\n<p>\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress out of earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":825,"image":{"id":430910,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Construction

Such shows responsibility and industriousness, and the group is very grateful for the economic support and trust provided by the parties involved.  Most of the members sell products such as food, clothes, domestic appliances, cosmetics, and alcoholic beverages.  Some members proviD. domestic services.  The group's President sells typical fare such as majaditos (a regional rice dish), patasca D. trigo pelado (wheat with jerked beef) and soup in the market from very early till late.  Therefore, she has very little time to spend with her children.  She hopes to spend more time with them, by focusing on lunch sales only, thereby increasing her earning potential.  However, at present, providing her children with an education and a roof over their heads takes priority.  As is the case with Sarah, many of the group's members also have to leave home to work.  However, such is the price they pay for household upkeep and to improve the lives of their children.  The purpose of the loan is to buy consumables, utensils and other necessary products in order to generate a higher income for the members' households.  The members' greatest wish is to be able to proviD. a stable home for their children as most of the members rent accommodation or live in 'anticr\u00edticos' (a particular type of renting) and are constantly having to relocate in search of a new place in which to rent.  Therefore, members have to work to be able to purchase a property or build on plots of land, which some have already managed to buy and which will proviD. a better life for their families.\r\n\r\n\r\n  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Justine Raymond, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3250,"image":{"id":480362,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"To generate business income ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-17 -65","type":"point"}},"partner_id":73,"posted_date":"2010-02-02T10:00:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":3250,"lender_count":65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sarah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Brisa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yolanda Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Angelica","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Catalina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Teresa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mary Luz","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Luisa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Orlando","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bila","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elvira","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-12-30T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":22500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":3250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":2135.94},{"due_date":"2010-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":2160.51},{"due_date":"2010-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":2185.37},{"due_date":"2010-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":2210.52},{"due_date":"2010-03-09T08:00:00Z","amount":2235.96},{"due_date":"2010-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":2261.69},{"due_date":"2010-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":2287.71},{"due_date":"2010-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":2314.04},{"due_date":"2010-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":2340.66},{"due_date":"2010-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":2367.6}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":308.52},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":312.08},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":315.66},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":319.3},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":322.97},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":326.69},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":330.45},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":334.25},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":338.09},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":341.99}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":936.26,"local_amount":6481.82,"processed_date":"2010-02-09T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:00:41Z","rounded_local_amount":6525.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123909437},{"amount":319.3,"local_amount":2210.52,"processed_date":"2010-02-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:01:15Z","rounded_local_amount":2225.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123909438},{"amount":322.97,"local_amount":2235.96,"processed_date":"2010-03-09T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T08:55:42Z","rounded_local_amount":2251.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128945013},{"amount":326.69,"local_amount":2261.69,"processed_date":"2010-03-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T08:56:06Z","rounded_local_amount":2277.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128945014},{"amount":1002.49,"local_amount":6940.32,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-25T07:54:45Z","rounded_local_amount":6987.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136673346},{"amount":0.3,"local_amount":2.09,"processed_date":"2010-05-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-12T08:09:45Z","rounded_local_amount":2.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144707368},{"amount":341.99,"local_amount":2367.6,"processed_date":"2010-05-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-12T08:10:12Z","rounded_local_amount":2383.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144707369}],"funded_date":"2010-02-05T22:47:57Z","paid_date":"2010-08-12T08:10:12Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Justine Raymond","image":null}},{"id":177179,"name":"Kunthea's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. N.

Five of the children are currently attending school. David is a dairy farmer from Litein town in Rift Valley, Kenya. He has been farming for 26 years. His farm produces milk, which is sold to the local market. He also earns income from his small-scale farming of tea, which is also sold locally.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

Maria wants to be able to afford to educate her children beyond High School and start them on a good career.  She leaves home very early in order to tend to her stall from which she sells clothing in the Mercado Bellavista (an important market in the city of Puno).  Every day she takes care of customers who come to buy:  she greets them in a happy manner and is very attentive to them.  The hardest part of Maria's job is bringing the clothing from Bolivia as the trip is very long and exhausting.  Nevertheless, she continues firm in the conviction that she will have a larger store in the future, a store where she will be able to offer a greater variety of clothes as her favourite thing is to sell and she is very convincing.  She has had this business for five years now, which has allowed her to give her children a decent life.  This is Maria's first loan with MFP and she is already saving in order to repay the loan.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to epic mountain passes, communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 percent of the country is mountainous and only 7 percent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is not employed, so her entrepreneurship produces her primary income. Shoista is 47 years old, married, and has four children. Her oldest son is away working in Russia.

She owns a business venture, selling both food & daily use products in the local community.  Ofu has many years of experience in this business.  Ofu needs a loan of WST $2500 to purchase additional products to sell.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 600 talas or US $250 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2005, Ofu joined SPBD.    This is her 4th loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Ofu's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Ofu V. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.9 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.4 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              1.5 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\"\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Her elder son works in a private company on a monthly wage while the younger one runs a barber shop.\r\n \r\nMusharaf has applied for a loan from Kiva partner, Asasah, for her husband\u2019s business. With the loan, her husband will buy another buffalo to increase sales. She hopes that, with the additional buffalo, her husband will have a better financial outcome and that soon he will open his own shop in the market where he can sell milk to his own customers.  \r\n\r\nMusharat is a regular loan user of Asasah and is in her 2nd loan cycle. In previous loan years she has proved herself a responsible person who has never missed a meeting and has paid her installments on time.\r\n \r\nNote: \u201cIn the picture, the lady who is raising her

She is 62 years old. Porferia is separated from spouse and has 5 adult-aged children. To make a living, Porferia owns & operates a business venture in the retail sector running a sari-sari (variety) retail shop. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from buying and selling daily use products such as canned goods, snacks, breads & candies in the local community. She is also planting and harvesting flowers in the season. Porferia has been engaged in her business for over 5 years and earns approximately 5000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Porferia joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Porferia has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional inventory & working capital. Porferia is requesting a new loan of 8000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell like biscuits and beverages. This loan will be the 2nd loan taken out by Porferia from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to expand the business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, we created this template for our field staff to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":717912,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to purchase additional products to sell like biscuits and beverages","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Laturan, Libona, Bukidnon","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":128,"posted_date":"2011-02-23T00:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":200,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Porferia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-02-17T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":8000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":400},{"due_date":"2011-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":400},{"due_date":"2011-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":400},{"due_date":"2011-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":400},{"due_date":"2011-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":400},{"due_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","amount":400},{"due_date":"2011-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":400},{"due_date":"2011-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":400},{"due_date":"2011-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":400},{"due_date":"2011-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":400},{"due_date":"2011-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":400},{"due_date":"2011-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":400},{"due_date":"2011-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":400},{"due_date":"2011-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":400},{"due_date":"2011-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":400},{"due_date":"2011-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":400},{"due_date":"2011-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":400},{"due_date":"2011-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":400},{"due_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":400},{"due_date":"2011-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":400}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":10,"local_amount":400,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:48:05Z","rounded_local_amount":434.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195854580},{"amount":50,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:15:34Z","rounded_local_amount":2172,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201296447},{"amount":40,"local_amount":1600,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:12:46Z","rounded_local_amount":1737.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206164730},{"amount":40,"local_amount":1600,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:25:37Z","rounded_local_amount":1737.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211237338},{"amount":50,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:16:08Z","rounded_local_amount":2172,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216515979},{"amount":10,"local_amount":400,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:58:45Z","rounded_local_amount":434.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221681275}],"funded_date":"2011-02-23T04:25:03Z","paid_date":"2011-08-15T08:58:45Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Dave Gibbons","image":608904}}]}
