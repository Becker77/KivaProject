For this reason he decided to become independent and form his own business. At first he worked with his father for a laundry-mat, but over time he saw that having his own business would give him more earnings and this is why he came to be independent. He started a little laundry-mat and added a repair service since many of his clients come in to the store without hems on their pants. <p>\r\nNevertheless, each time more, his clients bring their clothes to him, and his few washing machines are insufficient to clean his orders with the rapidness that they deserve. Therefore, he is requesting a loan of $375 that he is willing to pay back in a period of five months. With this money Jorge will be able to buy a second-hand washer that will help him finish his orders in less time.

He dedicates himself to providing private taxi transportation, for which he relies on two taxis.  He drives one himself, and hires a second driver for the other.  The previous loans he requested served to help maintain his vehicles.  On this occasion, the loan would be used to build a retaining wall for his home since, during the rainy seasons we are experiencing in the country there exists the risk of collapses.  This is particularly true in the zone in which he lives which is on a mountainside.  His wife supports him through the sale of jewelry and by caring for their school-aged children.

This is 41-year-old Olipa M. from Tukuyu. She is divorced with three children between the ages of 13 and 25. Olipa has been running a bar since 2004. Her bar is a good place to chill with a beer if you manage to finish work early on a Friday afternoon. It\u2019s the kind of place where you kick back on a plastic chair under a tree, with a local beer in hand, the aroma of roasting \u2018mishikaki\u2019  (kebabs made on an open fire) wafting around you, and talk to anyone and everyone who happens to wander by. <p>\r\n\r\nShe works at the business for 12 hours per day, 7 days per week. Two employees assist her. Olipa currently earns about 200USD a month from her business. She is requesting a loan of 400USD in order to purchase more crates of beer, soft drinks, and other drinks, like whisky, for her business. In the future, she plans to open the same business in a new location. Olipa thanks you for your support!<p>\r\n\r\nABOUT SELFINA:\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":288112,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pub","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To purchase more crates of beer, soft drinks, and other drinks for her business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbeya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.9 33.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-03-16T07:40:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Olipa A.

life, ensuring that they are free from poverty. She is married to Eduardo M., who worked as a laborer in a sugarcane plantation. They have eight children: six of them already have their own families and only two still live at home. The family lives in the village of Brgy. San Juan, Binalbagan, Negros Occidental.\r\n<p>\r\nBefore she went into business, Erlinda also worked in the sugarcane plantation with her husband so that they could earn enough to feed their family of ten. But working in the sugarcane fields is very hard work, with long hours for very low wages and few benefits, and it took her away from home leaving her children to fend for themselves. Watching her children grow, Erlinda thought about their future and realized that if the family did not earn more income, she and her husband could never afford to send the children to school and provide them with a better future. This is why she decided to put up a small general store next to her house, using some of her salary from the sugarcane plantation. However, because her capital was very limited, she could only sell a few products. \r\n<p>\r\nTo access more capital, Erlinda joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2002, and she immediately saw the impact of the additional 3,000 pesos she received from her first loan. She was able to buy more goods to sell and she noticed that the inventory turnover was faster, and she was able to earn more profits. So, as her income improved and NWTF-Project Dungganon allowed her to borrow larger amounts based on the cash flow estimates she presented in her proposal, she was able to expand her general store. \r\n<p>\r\nHer previous loan of 15,000 pesos was her twelfth loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. She was able to pay off each weekly installment on time, and fully repaid the loan within the loan term. It earned her an average monthly income of 3,000 pesos. For her thirteenth loan cycle, she is asking to borrow another 15,000 pesos to use as working capital for her general store so that she can continue improving the life of her family.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>About NWTF:<\/b>\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the call of not just a few, but thousands of women. Through the alleviation program, these women have progressed from earning less than a measly $1 a day, to realities surpassing their dreams. They have learned to live a life that can finally be called honorable. This is Project Dungganon!\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":391095,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

Y. is from the village of Polo.

Rosevilla has been engaged in her business for over 17 years and earns approximately 1,500 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n<br>In 2006, Rosevilla joined Kiva partner PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10,000 PHP from PMPC. This loan was used to purchase farm supplies and materials to manufacture nipa hut products. Rosevilla is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional raw materials to manufacture nipa hut products. This loan will be her eighth from PMPC, and this is the second time she is being published in Kiva.

Esta es la segunda vez que tiene un cr\u00e9dito con MFP y est\u00e1 feliz de seguir siendo parte integrante de su grupo comunal, donde las personas son bastante unidas. Con el cr\u00e9dito que solicita, comprar\u00e1 productos comestibles y de primera necesidad para surtir mejor su tienda.\n\n","en":"Jessica is 35 years old.  She lives in her own house with her one year old son, Alexander, and her life partner, 30 year old Denis.  They both work with great care looking to improve their economic situation.\r\n\r\nShe has had a business selling food for four years.  It is in a space in her house.  She is able to sell everything that comes into her hands because she is a good merchant.  She offers her products in a pleasant manner.\r\n\r\nShe has also been growing citrus fruits and bananas for two years.  She has occasional help from her husband.  He works in a mining settlement, which is located in the city of Yurinaki.  \r\n\r\nAs her store is the first to open its door to customers her work begins at four in the morning.  The men from the fields leave for their farms at this hour.  What she likes best is that her grocery store is always stocked with local food products.  The earnings allow her to cover the household expenses.\r\n\r\nAt the moment she is saving for later on.  She plans to build a house in the city of Santa Ana or La Merced in order to set up a store where she can sell wholesale and retail.  She also plans to renovate her banana fields.\r\n\r\nThis is her second loan with MFP.  She is happy to continue being a member of her communal bank where the people are very supportive.

Primary School, Kathanthabana village, eight miles from Makeni. R.C. Primary School was founded in 1964 by the R.C. Mission. R.C. Primary school is staffed with ten teachers and  has185 pupils. \r\n\r\nSchool staff from this institution, like many other schools' staff within SMT\u2019s operational areas, come to SMT to apply for loans. With the help of these loans, they can accomplish certain tasks that they would otherwise not have been able to accomplish with their mere salaries alone. But with the help of this loan, some can pay school fees for their children; others can use the loan to buy pieces of furniture, a plot of land, house-building materials, or invest in business. At the end of each month, these teachers can repay the loan out of their monthly salaries. The institution\u2019s bursar is directly responsible for deducting the repayment and pays SMT on their behalf.\r\n\r\nJoseph S. K. (pictured here) is the head teacher and leader of this group. The 52-year-old Joseph was born in Binkolo village, about six miles from Makeni. He has been in the teaching profession for sixteen years now. He is married to a teacher and the couple has seven children \u2013 two in primary school and five in secondary school. \r\n\r\nMr. K. backs up his teaching income with agriculture. He has been an agriculturist for seven years now.  He will use part of his loan to pay school fees for his children and invest the rest in agriculture.

She used her first loan of 3,000 PHP to buy two piglets and this is how she started her hog-raising business.

Now she is requesting a loan of 5,000 PHP to buy feed feed and vitamins for her hogs. She hopes to make a concrete piggery for her pigs.

Today, Ana Luisa is requesting a new loan - her seventh loan to date -- from Kiva and Esperanza International so she can buy more merchandise, including onions, eggplant, potatoes, salami, chicken, and used men's and women's clothing, for her store. When her loan is funded, Ana Luisa will travel by bus and\/or motorcycle taxi to La Romana, the closest big city, to buy the used clothing for her business, and she will go out further into the countryside to buy her produce from local farmers. \r\n\r\n<P>Ana Luisa's independent business is certainly a success story in its own right. She has been able to expand her business steadily over time, and she owns one of the most vibrant home enterprises in the La Gina batey. For example, the loan she will take out today is over twice the size of her very first loan, and she has expanded her merchandise offerings from chicken and used clothing to a whole variety of food and clothing goods. This is no small feat, considering that bateys are often the most economically stagnant communities in the Dominican Republic. Geographically isolated, and populated mostly by Dominicans of Haitian descent, who face the greatest difficulties in securing citizenship rights, starting and expanding a business in a rural batey is no easy task. Furthermore, it is especially impressive that Ana Luisa is able to take out a loan of this size at this time of the year, since commercial activity in the batey generally slows down considerably during the sugarcane off-season.<\/P>\r\n\r\n<P>Ana Luisa uses the revenues from her business to help support her three grandchildren who live with her and her husband. She helps to pay for their school uniforms and school supplies, and she hopes that her business will continue to fund their education in the future. Ana Luisa has six grown children of her own and 25 grandchildren!<\/P>\r\n\r\n<P>Ana Luisa appears in the center of the photograph with her four fellow group members of the Pasos Firmes (Solid Steps)

She is married and has four young children. To make a living, Malagaleupolu operates a business selling agricultural equipment. The main source of income for the business comes from selling plant seedlings and young crops to local farmers. Malagaleupolu has been engaged in this business for more than two years and earns approximately 350 Samoa Tala (about $132) a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Malagaleupolu joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Malagaleupolu is requesting a loan from SPBD of 750 WST, which will be used to purchase general agricultural supplies and equipment. This will be the first loan she has taken out from SPBD.  Malagaleupolu plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business  to improve\/expand her business.\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\n\r\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self-esteem.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

lenders.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":366842,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To

He has been a farmer since he was very young and has sold animals for the past three years.  He owns 0.25 hectares of arable land and he tends to lease a second plot of the same size to grow corn.  In addition, he buys and raises small farm animals (goats, lambs, ducks) which he raises and then sells to neighbors who, in turn, sell them in the city of Chiclayo and on the border with Ecuador.  This is the family's main source of income.\r\n\r\nA short time ago he harvested his corn crop but neglected the animal raising side of his business.  The small profits he got from his crops he intends to reinvest in his next planting but he must not continue to neglect his main source of family income.  For this reason, he has seen the need, for the first time, to ask Edpyme Alternativa for a loan.  He is asking for 1000 new soles to buy animals to continue to raise them for sale.  \r\n\r\nHis greatest wish is to build a house of substantial materials.

Romero is a young 22 year old woman who lives with her mother in a community called Ca\u00f1o Negro, located in Los Chiles, in the province of Alajuela.  This community is distinctive for being mountainous, and for being very close to the northern frontier of our country.  Its principal economic activities are livestock and agriculture, specifically the growth of basic grains, sugarcane, and oranges.\r\n\r\nSince Mayra finished high school, she worked helping her mother with household chores, as she had not yet found a job.  Thanks to the development of sustainable tourism in the area where she lives, various hotels opened that needed staff.  Thanks to the English that she learned in high school, today she is working as a receptionist in the Hotel Natural Lodge.  With this work, she has been able to improve the lives of her family and herself.\r\n\r\nDue to her schedule and the distance from her house, she has to walk alone from the place where the bus lets her off to her house at all hours of the night.  It is for this reason that she is asking for a loan of \u00a2666,000 (six hundred and sixty-six thousand colones) for the purchase of a motorcycle so she can transport herself to the hotel and so continue with her job. \r\n\r\nMayra is part of the Empresa de Cr\u00e9dito Comunal Emcrecoba, one of the 100 member organizations belonging to EDESA in Costa Rica.  This would be her first loan.  However, she emphasizes that thanks to this type of organization and related credit facilitations, many people without sufficient resources can reach their dreams.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from

In the future, Shanta plans to boost the economic condition of her family and she thanks you for your support.\r\n\r\nIn the Kathmandu Valley, small grocery stores, called pasals, are an important part of the local economy.  Fresh produce, milk, and staples such as rice, lentils, and flour are purchased daily for cooking in the home.  Owners of small grocery stores use Kiva loans to increase their purchasing power and profit margains.  By keeping inventory strong and purchasing in larger amounts, owners of these small stores are able to increase their profitability.  While a typical pasal might be no more than 100 square feet, they are always full of bargaining customers, incoming produce, and shrewd businesswomen.\r\n\r\nThis loan was administered by Kiva's local partner microfinance institution, Patan Business and Professional Women. Patan BPW became Kiva's first field partner in Nepal in 2007.  Patan BPW operates throughout the Kathmandu Valley, offering microcredit and business training programs to low-income women.  In addition to providing economic opportunity to their clients, Patan BPW seeks to empower Nepali women within the home and community.

I. is 46 years old, has completed high school, is married, has five children. Alimahmad is planning to use his loan to buy cattle and feed for fattening. Mr. I. has been doing this type of activity for the last 13 years. After completing fattening he will sell the cattle every 40-45 days and use the money he makes from sales to purchase more animals. The main buyers of his cattle are the citizens of the city Kurgan-Tyube and surrounding regions. This type of activity is the main source of income for the family.

She is a hardworking woman, 62 years old, a widow with three grandchilren between the ages of 12 and 15. All of them are in school, and she is their guardian.\r\n\r\nCufamune went to school until 4th grade, when she had to stop because of political turmoil during Portuguese colonial rule of the country.\r\n\r\nShe left Macia in 1966, going by herself to Boane, where she later married her late husband. She lives in her own house.\r\n\r\nShe's been a shopkeeper for some time and sells secondhand clothing. She learned business 23 years ago and the most popular products are men's suits, which she sells for 1800 meticals each. She acquires her goods in the city of Maputo at affordable prices. She uses her earnings to cover family expenses, including supporting her sister, who lives far away.\r\n\r\nShe's never received loans from other banks, and this is her second loan with Hluvuku-Adsema, in the amount of 25,000 meticals. She intends to use the loan to increase her sales and satisfy the demand for products during this winter season.\r\n\r\nShe used her first loan of 15,000 meticals for the same purpose. She learned about Hluvuku through friends and residents of Boane.\r\n\r\nShe intends to pay off her loan in full and on time, and to request new loans so she can begin selling products wholesale.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Andrea Rosenberg, Kiva

They operated a small restaurant in which they sold a variety of foods. When her husband died, however, things went downhill; nothing was the same, and the restaurant eventually closed. Mercedes has four children who are working, and they help her to pay her basic costs such as food and home repair. They work cultivating land in the rural areas of the Department of Matagalpa, where coffee, rice and beans are grown, among other basic staples. Mercedes is now dedicating herself to the needs of her home; she has worked with Afodenic during nine loan cycles to improve her business. With this loan, she wants to change the doors at the front of her house to improve security, since the wood has rotted and they need to be replaced. With her children's help, she will continue to make progress and cover her needs. Her goal is to reopen her business, and with the financing she hopes to achieve this; she is just giving herself a little time to get started. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Patricia

 His two children are 11 and 13 years old and both attend local secondary schools.  His wife is a construction worker and usually travels to various construction sites outside the town.  Turbat usually takes care of his two children and is responsible for family duties.

She has a store selling perishable basic needs items.  Even though she has had the business for several years, she has not been able to stock it with all of the necessary products, which people buy more frequently.\r\n\r\nThat is the reason that Mar\u00eda is asking for a loan.  It will allow her to buy products like detergents, meat, sausages, and other things.  Being able to stock the store is very important to Mar\u00eda because that is the way she gets more money.  She gives her husband the much needed help to pay their expenses.  This is because their children are adults, and they have their own jobs.  In spite of this, Mar\u00eda works a lot to have better economic stability together with her husband.  \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva

Margaret takes care of additional family members like her old parents and her sister's children. Formerly Margaret was selling second hand clothes but she changed her business enterprise to making envelopes and paper bags. She buys her raw materials from Nkrumah Road shops in Kampala city and uses public transport to and from buying these raw materials. She has been doing this business for the last three months. Margaret is now proud of this business.  Besides this business, she doesn\u2019t have any other side business.  She wants to use this loan to buy more raw materials like papers and glue.

She earns her living by operating three business ventures: food vending, fishing and a sari-sari (general) store. Her husband Julito Mojillo, who is 41 years old, works as a fisherman to earn his living, and also helps with his wife's business activities.  They have seven children who range in age from 7 months to 22 years old. Four of the children already work to help her support their family and one is still going to school. \r\n\r\nMarilyn joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1993 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 16 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Marilyn has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 19,500 Philippine pesos helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 10,000, uplifting the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 17th loan, she is borrowing PHP 21,000, which she intends to use as revolving working capital for her food-vending business so that she can continue to save up for the future security of her family and for the education of her child who is still going to school. Marilyn A. is a Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means \"honorable\") way. \r\n\r\n<b>About NWTF:<\/b>\r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon. Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

They currently have over 10,000 members, and are actively engaged in supporting the economic development of their members in the hopes of improving their quality of life, and that of their at-risk children.\n \nAl Ouma's members are currently organized into smaller associations which meet each week to contribute to a group fund that helps finance small loans for members.  Members typically put in $2 USD per week. Because UIMCEC and Al Ouma both share the mission of fighting poverty through economic empowerment, they have formed a partnership to provide loans to Al Ouma associations at a lower interest rate than UIMCEC usually offers its clients\n\n","en":"The Apec-Al Ouma Mekhe group 2 is part of the Mekhe branch affiliated to Al OUma.

On the other hand, they are motivated by the income that this work brings. The group 2 of Apeck Al Ouma Mekhe is represented by Mr. Cheikh D., who raises a herd in the village and, as a parallel activity, buys barrels of vegetable oil that he resells to the stores in Yoff. He has been in this business for over 5 years. The group is seeking a loan of 2,250,000 West African francs for purchasing livestock, seeds and pesticides. Their goal is growing their business and improving the quality of life and socioeconomic status of their

Ishdorj is very hard-working and enthusiastic person. Last year he dug a well for water on his land and planted vegetables. He was overwhelmed with the harvest and it gave him a big inspiration. Now he is planning to buy a 84 sq. meter greenhouse which consists of a metal frame and polyethylene film and grow vegetables such as tomatoes, cucumbers, lettuces and so on. \r\n\r\nIshdorj's family is very happy that now they will be able to use their own dairy products and vegetables all year around.

She is the lady in the far left of the photo. Tatto is 35 years old and married with six children. She has operated her restaurant for two years. One day she hopes to be able to build some rental units. She will use this loan to continue buying foodstuffs for her restaurant. Tatoo serves typical Ugandan dishes such as matooke, cassava, posho, rice, beans, Irish potatoes, chicken and beef. <\/p>\r\n<p>At Pearl, loans to groups are the most common. Through its long presence in Uganda, Pearl is able to identify villages that would benefit from microfinance loans. They contact village leaders, religious groups, etc. to see if there is a need and desire amongst villagers. If the need exists, they meet with businesses and begin a month or two of weekly meetings, educating business owners about the risks and benefits of such loans. If agreed, a lending group forms with chairperson, secretary and treasurer, voted in by members of the group. Members chose which businesses will qualify for loans and how much each qualified business member will receive as a loan. The added total becomes the group loan.<\/p>\r\n<p>It is important that this is done by the group members because, as a group, they are all responsible for the repayment of the loan. One would not want a business in the group to default, because it can cost the other members. This type of peer pressure is very effective. Persons in groups create a very strong bond with each other. They are very supportive of each other and members have long histories in groups. Meetings are very business-like and the sense of empowerment is evident.

Renecer Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rudilani is the coordinator of the Bank of Hope, Nuevo Renacer, which roughly translates to \u201crebirth\u201d in English. Their Bank of Hope is the first such group to be formed in their community of La Barquita and they are proud to be part of the new relationship between their community and Esperanza International.\r\n<p>\r\nRudilania is a 28 year old woman who lives with her husband. They have one daughter together but due to tough economic circumstances their daughter lives with her grandmother.\r\n<p>\r\nRudilania has asked for this loan to start a new business selling clothing. She plans to make a part of her small house a sales room and will travel around her neighborhood to market her new store.  Specifically, she is excited to begin selling new mens' and womens' jeans, as well as blouses and undergarments.  She will purchase the clothes from a market in Santo Domingo called Villa Consuelo, an area famous for high-quality, imported clothes at discount prices. Through the training she received from Esperanza, she learned that purchasing clothes at a wholesale discount, or at a small discount, substantially increases her profit margin, and consequently enables her to generate more income.  \r\n<p>\r\nHer biggest goal is to provide a better life for her daughter and give her what she herself never had growing up.  Her personal goal is to continue studying and to graduate from the medical school she has been studying at.  Rudilani is being trained in dialysis and blood work, as well as in providing vaccinations.  Her biggest challenges revolve around the lack of opportunity to improve her business and to work.  For the first time in a year and a half, Esperanza International is giving her the opportunity to return to work and create a stable income for her family.\r\n<p>\r\nIn her free time, she likes to spend as much time as she can with her daughter, as well as study, read, and go to her local church.  Rudilania sincerely thanks everyone who is supporting not just her loan, but also the loans of her group members.  She says that without opportunities like these, they are not able to move forward with their lives and live the lives that they know they can.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

They live in the Conchan de Milagro community located about 45 minutes outside the city of Cuenca.  The people work in farming and it\u2019s a beautiful area because from there, they can see the city of Cuenca.\r\n\r\nMrs. Blanca C. has been a member of this bank for three cycles.  She is 22, and lives in a common-law marriage with her partner and two-month-old son.  He was born  in the home that they share with her mother and they pay some of the household expenses since they still don\u2019t have their own house.  Her husband works as a carpenter and she in sewing.  She studied for three years at a school,  and was working in a jeans factory but left when her first child was born.\r\n\r\nBlanca has a lovely friendship with all her companions at the bank. The loans that she has received she has used for the birth of her son. With the new loan she\u2019s going to pay for a dresser for the baby.  Her goal is to continue in what she likes most, sewing.\r\n\r\n\r\nRosa D. is in her second loan cycle in the community bank.  She was invited by her friends and members of the bank. She has used the loan to buy chickens and guinea pigs in the last two year, dividing up her time with the household chores and caring for her children.  She raises the animals to sell as well as for consumption in her own house.\r\n\r\nOur member lives in the Conchan de Milagro community in the outskirts of the city of Cuenca.

Her three oldest are studying in different schools in the city  and the three youngest in a local school.  Her husband is a carpenter but he is always looking for extra work to round out his salary.  She also comments that the house where they live is the fruit of  their effort and the sacrifices by the two of them.\r\n\r\nShe will use the loan that she is requesting to buy an electric saw for her husband\u2019s carpentry work.

So every day Edwin prepares his meals and heads off to his fields, and he brings his young son with him because he has no one to leave the child with. They spend all day together caring for their land. Of all the work that he does, Edwin enjoys planting coffee and picking the beans to sell them to the commercial wholesalers, who recognize the quality of his product and pay him a good price. He hopes to plant more coffee plants because this is a very profitable product, which sells for 8 soles per kilo.

She also has an orchard where she raises vegetables for sale and for feeding her family.\r\n\r\nShe is asking for this loan in order to invest in her businesses, such as buying chickens, hog feed, and other things.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Hugo Reyes, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1500,"image":{"id":576363,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Poultry, feed, and supplies","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PY","country":"Paraguay","town":"Ybycu\u00ed","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-22.993333 -57.996389","type":"point"}},"partner_id":58,"posted_date":"2010-07-29T16:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1500,"lender_count":48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Estelvina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Justa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Florencia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Angelina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marciana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Julia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Vilma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Francisca ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Delia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marcelina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lilian","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Reinita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Claudelina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-06-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PYG","disbursal_amount":7029544,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":1171591},{"due_date":"2010-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1171591},{"due_date":"2010-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1171591},{"due_date":"2010-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1171591},{"due_date":"2010-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":1171591},{"due_date":"2010-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":1171589}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":250}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":250,"local_amount":1171591,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:13:56Z","rounded_local_amount":1185000.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159638753},{"amount":250,"local_amount":1171591,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:18:50Z","rounded_local_amount":1185000.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166852815},{"amount":250,"local_amount":1171591,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:09:16Z","rounded_local_amount":1185000.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172119582},{"amount":250,"local_amount":1171591,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T14:15:51Z","rounded_local_amount":1185000.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177413540},{"amount":250,"local_amount":1171591,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T14:12:42Z","rounded_local_amount":1185000.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182553188},{"amount":250,"local_amount":1171589,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T13:15:18Z","rounded_local_amount":1184998.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188689612}],"funded_date":"2010-07-29T20:42:55Z","paid_date":"2011-01-15T13:15:18Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Hugo E.

International\n\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

This is a business that Jorge knows very well and he covers an area that supplies clients in San Jacinto, San Juan Nepomuceno, El Guamo and other parishes within the area.  Jorge works together with his wife on their business and he and his family (his wife and two children ages 8 and 16) are financially dependent on this.\r\n\r\nHe started out in the banana sales business when he was transporting this produce by lorry from el Urab\u00e1 to the Caribbean Coast of Colombia, where he got to know the suppliers and decided to establish a sales outlet in San Juan Nepomuceno.  From there he began to expand, looking for new clients in other villages as he is currently still doing.\r\n\r\nTheir sales are high as they are the distributors for the area assigned to them.  They sell banans directly to businesses such as shops, restaurants and retail outlets in the market.  Their total assets are comprised largely of a car and motorbike, very useful for the distribution of their products.\r\n\r\nJorge is applying for his first Kiva loan, but his wife has received 6 sets of funding from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, which she has invested into their business.  With their Kiva loan they will buy bananas directly, guaranteeing better pries which he will be able to pass on to his customers.  His business has grown thank to funding from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, as he now has a distribution vehicle, four members of staff, a cold room and a fixed client base.  His future target is to expand his cold room and diversify his product line to include new produce such as vegetables so as to continue to better his family's well-being, particularly so as to secure a quality education for his children. His biggest challenge is when there are fruit harvests, which reduces sales and for this reason he plans to dabble in other products that could replace his current produce.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":927810,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Goods

La provincia de Urubamba est\u00e1 ubicada al norte de la ciudad del Cusco, a orillas del r\u00edo Vilcanota, en una zona que se conoce como el \u201cValle Sagrado\u201d debido a su clima templado, tierra  f\u00e9rtil y abundantes riachuelos, que hacen de este valle uno de los m\u00e1s bellos del planeta.\n","en":"Florencio, age 46, is married and has four children.  He was born in the Apur\u00edmac department, but he lives in the town of Cotowincho in the Urubamba province.\r\n\r\nHe is a bricklayer.  However, with great sadness he tells us that 14 years ago he had an accident where he fractured his foot.  He later recovered, but only for a short while.  Now the fractured foot has started to bother him and affect his work performance.  At times it has gone to the extreme of not letting him work, and he even has to use crutches again.\r\n\r\nFlorencio is a very hard-working person.  In spite of the adversities, he continues on and manages to continue working.  He has to arrange his fractured foot so that it is not a problem when it is time to work.\r\n\r\nHe has worked for several years, and thanks to the effort he puts into his work it is going very well for him. \r\n\r\nFlorencio now needs the loan to buy medications.  Florencio is a member of the Nueva Vision de Rumichaca communal bank.  This group is comprised of 19 members who live in the Urubamba province.  \r\n\r\nThe province of Urubamba is north of the city of Cusco on the banks of the Vilcanota River.  It is a zone that is known as the \u201cValle Sagrado\u201d (Sacred Valley) because of its temperate climate, fertile land, and abundant streams.  They make this valley one of the most beautiful on the planet.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":958202,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Medical Expenses","sector":"Health","themes":null,"use":"to buy medications.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Rumichaca- Urubamba - Cusco","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":119,"posted_date":"2011-12-24T23:50:14Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":200,"lender_count":6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Florencio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-12-21T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":75.53},{"due_date":"2012-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":78.53},{"due_date":"2012-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":81.65},{"due_date":"2012-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":84.89},{"due_date":"2012-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":88.25},{"due_date":"2012-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":91.15}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.21},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.41},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.66},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.96},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.3},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.46}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":30.21,"local_amount":75.53,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T09:36:40Z","rounded_local_amount":81.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257122167},{"amount":31.41,"local_amount":78.53,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T08:39:38Z","rounded_local_amount":84.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263247088},{"amount":32.66,"local_amount":81.65,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T08:33:33Z","rounded_local_amount":87.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":269971864},{"amount":33.96,"local_amount":84.89,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T08:50:52Z","rounded_local_amount":91.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276578801},{"amount":35.3,"local_amount":88.25,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T11:01:26Z","rounded_local_amount":95.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283399964},{"amount":36.46,"local_amount":91.15,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T08:24:56Z","rounded_local_amount":98.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287096514}],"funded_date":"2011-12-25T02:21:34Z","paid_date":"2012-07-15T08:24:56Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ginny Kalish"}},{"id":378823,"name":"Alan Eduardo","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El se\u00f1or Alan Eduardo es casado,  tiene 22 a\u00f1os de edad, curs\u00f3 los grado de educaci\u00f3n diversificada, tiene 1 hijo, se dedica a la prestaci\u00f3n de servicios de transporte a estudiantes del lugar donde vive hacia otros lugares de nuestro pa\u00eds, inici\u00f3 este negocio con el apoyo de su padre y hasta el momento lleva 4 a\u00f1os de experiencia.\n\nsolicita un pr\u00e9stamo que lo utilizara para tapizar su veh\u00edculo, para ofrecer mejor comodidad a sus cliente, y como tambi\u00e9n dar un servicio completo a su veh\u00edculo, quiere seguir mejorando y tener una buena productividad.","en":"Alan Eduardo is 22 years old and married.

She got married early to Arnel, who is 32 years old and a jeepney driver. She lives in the beautiful town of Cardona, Rizal province in the Philippines.\r\n\r\nWith her determination to bring a better life to her family, especially to her children, Barbara needed to engage in a business that could add support to her husband\u2019s meager income. In 2006, she joined ASHI (Ahon sa Hirap, Inc.), an MFI and Kiva partner in the Philippines, hoping to have access to capital to start a business. When she received her first loan, she invested it in the resale of frozen foods and, with her next loan and up to the present, she is still in the same business. She likes the business since her product is in demand with families during breakfast as food for their children. She already has regular customers and even receives orders.\r\n\r\nNow, Barbara is requesting a loan of 20,000 pesos as additional capital for her resale of frozen foods. Specifically, the loan will be used to pay for twenty kilos of pork longganisa (sausages flavored with indigenous spices), twenty kilos of hotdogs, twenty kilos of ground beef, and to pay for transportation expenses. Some will be set aside as rolling capital.\r\n\r\nBarbara hopes that with the support of ASHI and the assistance of Kiva lenders, she can reach her dreams: to send her children to school until college; to expand her business; and to set her family free from poverty.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":376756,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Convive con su pareja con quien tiene dos hijos de 06 y 02 a\u00f1os, \u00e9l vive junto a su familia en casa de su hermana. Todos los d\u00edas se esfuerza mucho para as\u00ed poder brindar una mejor calidad de vida a su familia. El trabajo de Elder consiste en el transporte de pasajeros dentro y fuera de la ciudad. Desde muy temprano sale en busca de sus eventuales clientes a quienes brinda un servicio de calidad y con calidez humana, adicional a la seguridad. Pues \u00e9l como un transportista responsable tiene siempre en regla su documentaci\u00f3n y esta al pendiente de las fallas que pueda tener su vehiculo para la satisfacci\u00f3n de sus clientes. Cuando se inicio en este trabajo manejaba una mototaxi de manera de alquiler, esto no le produc\u00eda muchos ingresos y por lo mismo no estaba contento haciendo esa actividad, ahora pudo comprar su vehiculo y trabaja para \u00e9l mismo. Lleva 6 a\u00f1os trabajando de manera independiente y le esta yendo muy bien. Le gusta mucho su trabajo pues se distrae, divierte y sobre todo genera ingresos diarios para su familia, adem\u00e1s que tiene un gran apoyo de su conviviente, quien se encarga de vender algunos productos en la vereda de su casa y significa un ingreso adicional a su econom\u00eda.

Por otro lado se compromete una vez mas en cumplir con el pago de sus cuotas, como en anteriores cr\u00e9ditos que tuvo.

He lives with his partner and they have two children, aged 6 and 2. He lives with the family, in his sister's house. Every day he works hard to offer his family a better quality of life. Elder's work consists of transporting passangers in and outside the city. He sets off very early to look for customers, and he provides them with good service and a warm reception, as well as the security of taking a moto taxi. As a responsible transport operative, he always has his papers in order, and he depends on having a vehicle that customers are happy to ride in. When he started out in this business, he used to rent a moto taxi, but he was not happy with that and it was hard to generate much of an income. He has since been able to buy his own vehicle, and has been working independently for 6 years now. It is going well. He likes his work a lot, because it is interestinig, it can be fun, and above all it generates income for his family.\r\n\r\nElder is also ably supported by his partner, who sells various different products from the sidewalk outside their house to bring in additional income. Now she plans to expand what she sells and carry a greater range of products. This will be Elder's fourth loan with MFP. He is very happy knowing that he can access this financial support, because it gives him confidence that he can continue in his business. He promises once again to make his repayments on time, as he did on the previous loans he had. Also he is grateful to be part of his communal bank, because he says that its members are all very responsible people who pull together. With the sum he is seeking he will repair or change parts of his mototaxi. He will also buy fruit and vegetables to sell outside his home."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":976057,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Motorcycle

Her husband, Mr. Em Muon, is a construction worker whose small income helps to support the family. <p>\r\n\r\nKem has six children, two of whom are employed in a garment factory while another is a construction worker. The remaining three are attending the local school. Two of the men shown in the photo are representing their wives who were unavailable due to work commitments.<p>\r\n\r\nThis is a village bank loan consisting  mainly of end-of-term loans. Three members have end-of-term loans and the rest have monthly payment loans. These members are not required to pay aN. principal on the loan until the very end of the loan term. End-of-term (EoT) loans are AMK's main product because they are the most beneficial to Cambodia's poor, allowing them to repay portions of the principal whenever they are financially able to. Most clients start to make payments maN. months before the end of the loan term. Almost all of AMK's clients make their payments on time. AMK has a delinquency rate of only 0.09% and AMK has a default rate of 0% on
