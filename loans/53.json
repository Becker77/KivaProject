Together they have four children, two of whom are twin girls. They are a family of scarce economic resources but are very close. Thanks to Javier's work, they have succeeded in locating and buying a plot of land on which they built the small house they currently live in, which is located in the zone of Alto Cotapachi in the city of Cochabamba. Costa's primary activity is the raising and sale of pigs. She buys small pigs, and then she fattens them and sells them at a higher price. In this way, she generates more income in order to sustain her children. The purpose of this loan is to buy pigs. Since she sold all of her pigs during the Christmas season, this loan will greatly help her by letting her buy more pigs. She will fatten them and this way generate more income. Among her dreams and goals is to have a small farm of pigs, because she says this activity is going well for her and that her four children will be able to study a professional career and therefore have a better standard of living."}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1279466,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy pigs.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"Cochabamba","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-17.383333 -66.15","type":"point"}},"partner_id":140,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1500,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Costa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-12-27T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":10200,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":1500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":850},{"due_date":"2013-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":850},{"due_date":"2013-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":850},{"due_date":"2013-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":850},{"due_date":"2013-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":850},{"due_date":"2013-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":850},{"due_date":"2013-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":850},{"due_date":"2013-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":850},{"due_date":"2013-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":850},{"due_date":"2013-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":850},{"due_date":"2013-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":850},{"due_date":"2014-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":850}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Matt Watson","image":1215361}},{"id":593201,"name":"Mujeres So\u00f1adoras Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El grupo est\u00e1 conformado por cuatro socias emprendedoras una de ellas es Irene mujer de 37 a\u00f1os de edad, casada, con tres hijos de 20, 14 y 4 a\u00f1os, su negocio es la venta de ropa desde hace un a\u00f1o.

K. is a young entrepreneur, aged 30. She is married with three children aged six, four and two years. Her first-born is in primary one while the rest spend their time with their grandmother. <p>Juliet sells matoke (green bananas), a staple food for Baganda and Banyankore. There is ready market because a big percentage of the population in Kampala eat matoke. In addition to matoke, she sells tomatoes, onions and cassava at wholesale.

By the quality of his work, he manages to earn the trust of many people and certain governmental and private organizations.  Married and the father of three, he lives with his small family in An\u00e9ho, where he practices his trade.  Though he is in high demand and works at many locations in the prefecture, he is no longer able to oversee the jobs for which he often mobilizes his apprentices and master masons.  His spotty work site coverage is the source of discontent for people who entrust their projects to him.  To facilitate the trips he makes to coordinate and supervise his work sites, he needs a means of adequate transport.

Josefina also accepts laundry business whenever she is not in the market and this gives her an extra income. \r\n\r\nJosefina is requesting a loan of PHP5,000 as her additional capital to further grow her business. She will use it to buy more vegetables to sell in the market. This will help her earn more income to use for the allowances of her children who are all studying.\r\n\r\nJosefina is very blessed to have five intelligent children. Her three elder children are scholars of the Local Government Unit and she is only supporting the tuition fees of her two younger children who are both in elementary school. Josefina is married to Felomeno, who earns an income being a caretaker of an eight-hectare farm. The couple hopes for a good future for their child. That\u2019s why they also do their part as parents to provide their other needs.

Bawji goes door to door selling African attire and ladies hand bags. She incurs transport costs to and from buying African attire and ladies hand bags from DRC (Democratic Republic of Congo). She works seven days a week. She receives an average of five customers a day and sells to all categories of people in retail. Her greatest monthly expenses include feeding her family and school fees for her children. Her major business challenges are transportation and seasonality. She has been in this business for ten years and with MCDT for seven years, now servicing her sixteenth loan. She wants to use this loan to buy more rolls of African attire (bitengi) and ladies hand bags. She aspires to see her business grow bigger, to start selling wholesale only, and to also own a permanent business

Three years ago, she established a small bookstore in her home.  From the start she set it up in her living room, and shortly thereafter installed shelves for holding merchandise and a door to make it feel more comfortable.  She enjoys selling school supplies and stationery because it is quiet work that can be performed at home without having to leave her children.  What she does not like is the dust that accumulates in the area where she lives because it constantly causes her merchandise to deteriorate.  Hermelinda operates her store from 7am until 9pm and also sells decorations and stuffed toys that have sufficient demand.  She is very happy because the income generated from her bookstore-bazaar has allowed her to help her husband with the household expenses.\r\n<p>\r\nThis is her first loan with MFP.  Hermelinda is grateful to everyone who made it possible for her to access this loan that will allow her to continue working.

She is married and has 2 children, one of whom is currently in school.  She has a business running a salon, which she has had for 1 year.         \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Nulu has requested a loan of 200,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda.  The loan will be used to purchase more braids to use.  With the help of the loan from BRAC, she hopes to generate greater profits and pay for school fees and food.  In the future, Nulu hopes to expand her business further and eventually purchase a house.  She is a member of BRAC\u2019s Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program, which has helped her prospects for the future by showing her how to learn about customers and to be patient. \r\n\r\nNote to lenders: BRAC Uganda has recently begun posting a new type of loan to Kiva which funds young entrepreneurs in BRAC\u2019s Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program.  This Kiva borrower is receiving a new ELA loan. The ELA program first provides disadvantaged adolescents, usually girls who are out of school, with livelihood training and financial literacy skills.  Afterward, ELA participants can receive microfinance loans to expand their small businesses.  These loans target a segment of the population not typically served by traditional microfinance, and offer adolescents a unique chance to access finance at a young age and improve their prospects for the future.  Kiva is privileged to partner with BRAC Uganda in posting these new loans, and to give Kiva lenders the opportunity to fund deserving young entrepreneurs and support a promising new sector in microfinance.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":100,"image":{"id":593774,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty

Village Bank Loan group consists of 19 people who live in BoE. Krum Leu village in Kandal province.

She has 4 children, one of whom is employed in a garment factory while the others attend the local school. Mrs. Ratha C. owns a hectar field to cultivate rice to earn her living. Her husband, Mr. Ngin Sinat, is a blacksmith in the local village. \r\n\r\nAlthough Mrs. Ratha C. and her husband try to work hard, they still have little income to improve their living condition. Also, Mrs. Ratha C.'s husband wants to start a fishing business so she decided to ask for a loan to buy fishnets for her husband. \r\n\r\nFifteen members in this loan are end-of-term loans so they are not required to pay any principal on the loan until the end of the loan's term. End-of-term (EoT) loans are AMK's main product because they are most beneficial for Cambodia's poor, who can repay portions of the principal whenever they are financially able to. Most clients start to make their payments many months before the end of the loan term. Almost all of AMK's clients make their payments on time. AMK has a delinquency rate of only 0.09% and AMK has a default rate of 0% on

Eleven are women, and there is only one man.  All of them are very united friends, who are active and entrepreneurial.  They are in their second cycle, and they demonstrate responsibility and the capacity to pay.  Among the activities they do is selling clothes, American clothes, selling food in boarding houses in their homes, and selling calendar cards.  Others make articles of clothing, curtains, and traditional pastries.  Some of them have commercial businesses in their own homes or rent stalls.  Others work as street merchants.  Some have extra income from selling cosmetics by catalog.  \n\nIn detail, the members' businesses are as follows: Cecilia Andrea, the group's president, sells food and has 15 years of experience. Bertha has been selling cards for the past two years, Elar has had a cell phone stand for the past three years, Karina is a hairdresser and has been working at her salon for the past two years, Hilda has been selling meals for the past year, Renalia has been selling pollera-style skirts for the past two years, Josefa has been selling clothing for 20 years, Fabiola has been selling food for the past year, Senovia also sells food but has 12 years of experience, Mevlis also sells food and has 14 years of experience, Delicia has been selling clothing for the past year, and Marisol generates income by renting out her car; she has been doing so for the past 10 years. \n\nAs far as competition goes, it is always there.  But, the members adjust to get ahead in their businesses.  They diversify their merchandise or travel to sell in outlying areas of the city.  This allows them to generate the necessary movement to support their families.\n\nThe loan is to get working materials, wholesale supplies, and to improve their homes to make their families more comfortable.  As far as the members\u2019 expectations go, they wish to be able to have their own houses.  That is why they put forth so much effort; they want to give their children a stable roof over their heads.  They want to give each one of them a better future.\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva

With your help, this will be possible.   \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

She is 57 years old. Elizabeth is married and has six adult children. To make a living, Elizabeth owns and operates a business selling home products. The main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling personal home products to tourists and local community members. Elizabeth has been engaged in her business for more than five years and earns approximately 5,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2005, Elizabeth joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. Elizabeth has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Elizabeth is requesting a new loan of 15,000 PHP, which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This loan will be the seventh loan taken out by Elizabeth from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":578231,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Products

With the help of this loan Neftali has been able to purchase all of the materials he needs all at once, obtaining a better price and saving on the cost of making several trips.\r\n\r\nIn the future Neftali would like to plant in larger quantities to increase his harvests for sale.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":895487,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase fertilizers for the 10,500 square meters of farmland where he cultivates corn and beans.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Anamoros","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2011-11-01T07:01:59Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":500,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Neftali","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-09-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":37},{"due_date":"2011-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":37.79},{"due_date":"2011-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":38.29},{"due_date":"2012-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":39.14},{"due_date":"2012-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2012-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":41.32},{"due_date":"2012-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":41.8},{"due_date":"2012-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":43.04},{"due_date":"2012-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":43.54},{"due_date":"2012-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":44.73},{"due_date":"2012-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":45.62},{"due_date":"2012-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":47.73}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.79},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.29},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39.14},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.32},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.8},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.04},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.54},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.73},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.62},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.73}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":78.21,"local_amount":78.21,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:52:41Z","rounded_local_amount":78.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244562734},{"amount":39.98,"local_amount":39.98,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:03:00Z","rounded_local_amount":39.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250773863},{"amount":41.2,"local_amount":41.2,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T10:16:21Z","rounded_local_amount":41.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257182444},{"amount":41.89,"local_amount":41.89,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:28:59Z","rounded_local_amount":41.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263317425},{"amount":298.72,"local_amount":298.72,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T09:24:29Z","rounded_local_amount":298.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270033081}],"funded_date":"2011-11-18T21:03:28Z","paid_date":"2012-04-15T09:24:29Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":351075,"name":"Dawui","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Dawui est une femme de 33 ans.

Salustio is very proud of his daughters because, despite coming from such a humble family, they have not left their studies or stopped working in order to get ahead and help their parents. <p>\r\n\r\nSalustio devotes himself to the sale of charcoal and, as a result of his earnings from this activity as well as some loans, he was able to open a store in his home that his wife can manage and obtain additional income for the family.

They began by selling merchandise such as soda, beer, wine and whiskey.  Later, they added to this baked goods, herbs, sugar, sweets, rice and noodles, among other items.<p>\r\n\r\nSalustio has not been able to carry out his charcoal selling activities over the last month because he is suffering from an infirmity that doesn\u2019t allow him to focus 100% on this effort.  For this reason he wants to reinforce his sales at the general store as these are, for the moment, the primary means of income for the family other than the daughters\u2019 small salaries which cannot support them. <p>\r\n\r\nThe loan he is seeking would be used to better supply the store, since the neighbors in the area request certain types of products such as canned goods, cleaning supplies, meat, and fruits and vegetables.<p>   \r\n\r\n<p><b> Translated from Spanish by Mary Lynn, Kiva Volunteer. <\/b><p>\r\n\r\nEl Sr. Salustio F. tiene 64 a\u00f1os, es una persona muy activa y emprendedora, vive con su esposa Leonarda Gim\u00e9nez, y su dos hijas las cuales ya son mayores de edad, ambas trabajan en el Hospital Nacional de Itag\u00faa, uno de los m\u00e1s grandes hospitales del Pa\u00eds.

with 7 children, 4 of them below 15 years of age. Salomen came to know about GHAPE in the year 2003 after encountering some challenges in life such as ill health, death of relatives, and poverty. In order to overcome these challenges, Salomen received her first loan in the year she came to know of GHAPE in the amount of 20,000 frs; she received a loan of 60,000 frs in the year 2004, 80,000 frs in the year 2005, and 150,000 frs in the year 2007. The repayment of the various loans was done promptly.<P>\r\n\r\nGiven her present loan, she plans to rent a plot for cultivation for 100,000 frs; 50,000 frs will be used for the purchase of seeds, and 50,000 frs will be used for the purchase of fertilizer. She will commence repayment on the fourth month from the day of disbursement. This  business will help her community by providing food for them, and many of them will buy from her. With the profit from the loan, she plans to give sound education to her children, complete her house, and bring her daughter  who has been sick for a long period of time to the hospital. She prefers to receive a loan from GHAPE  because of the social training GHAPE  offers, and the issue of collateral security is not a problem.<P>\r\n\r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon.  GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach.  Every client is trained in business management, basic health, life skills, financial management, profits and losses, and family values.  Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement.  GHAPE instills a sense of family and community within its clients and staff and has developed a strong bond of trust between the organization and its clients.  \r\n

taking out loans two years ago to expand her business. She has proven herself extremely credit-worthy and is now on her sixth loan. With this loan she will buy more supplies to make more empanadas, which she sells to her friends, to stores and on the street. Her business has grown so much with these loans that she has been able to buy a motorcycle which allows her to distribute her empanadas to even more locations. \r\n\r\nJuana is the single mother of three children, aged 13, 10, and 8. She says it has been very difficult raising all of them by herself but, with the growth of her business from her loans, she has been able to provide them with enough food and can afford to send them to school. She hopes to continue to grow her businesses so that one day she can send her children to college. \r\n\r\nOn behalf of Juana and the entire La Union en Progreso group, thank you for providing

She lives with her husband, who works in the regional university, and their four school aged children.\r\n\r\nFor two years she has been selling food (various dishes, chicken soup, and drinks) every morning.  She had a ramada (wood and straw roof) built in front of her house for her business.  Under the ramada there are tables and benches so she can serve her dishes.  What she likes most about her work is that so many people enjoy her flavorful cooking.  Giving them good service is the most important thing to her.

He lives in the house that his parents left him.  He is prepared to work very hard to succeed in life.\r\n\r\nJorge\u2019s day starts at six in the morning when he opens his clothing stand and gets ready to start selling his merchandise.  He has a stand in the Tupac Amaru Market (a very important market in the city of Juliaca).  He tends his stand all day, and he closes at nine at night.  He knows that the next day another day\u2019s work awaits him.  What he likes most about his business is talking with his customers and convincing them to buy something.  He has been doing this for five years.  The most difficult part is having to stay all day in the same place.  \r\n\r\nIn the future he hopes to have a larger store where he can sell a larger variety of clothing.\r\n\r\nThis is Jorge\u2019s first loan with MFP.

While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nRemedios is married and has 5 adult children. To make a living, Remedios owns & operates a tailoring business. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from providing specialty tailoring services to local community members. Remedios has been engaged in her business for over 7 years and earns approximately 5000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Remedios joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Remedios has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional fabrics & materials. Remedios is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional tailoring equipment such as needles & thread. This will be the sixth loan taken out by Remedios from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Munhtsetseg purchases the products and with her sibling sells them through two sales channels at the local market. <p>\r\n\r\nMunhtsetseg, an experienced trader who has many plans for the future, says, \"I would like to expand my business and purchase my own shipping container for my business.\"  She is now requesting a 2,300,000 tugrug (~ 1685 USD) loan to purchase a large amount of inventory including clothing and consumer goods because demand for her products is increasing. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1700,"image":{"id":520158,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"To purchase inventory","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MN","country":"Mongolia","town":"Govi-Altai","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"46 105","type":"point"}},"partner_id":116,"posted_date":"2010-04-06T19:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1700,"lender_count":62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Munhtsetseg","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MNT","disbursal_amount":2300000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":1700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":230000},{"due_date":"2010-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":230000},{"due_date":"2010-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":230000},{"due_date":"2010-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":230000},{"due_date":"2010-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":230000},{"due_date":"2010-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":230000},{"due_date":"2010-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":230000},{"due_date":"2010-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":230000},{"due_date":"2011-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":230000},{"due_date":"2011-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":230000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":170},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":170},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":170},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":170},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":170},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":170},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":170},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":170},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":170},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":170}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":171.11,"local_amount":231504,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T10:18:43Z","rounded_local_amount":234190.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144795341},{"amount":168.89,"local_amount":228531,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-16T07:53:56Z","rounded_local_amount":231183.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151975865},{"amount":170,"local_amount":230010.24,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T12:20:04Z","rounded_local_amount":232679.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159713231},{"amount":170.32,"local_amount":230430.5,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T11:43:35Z","rounded_local_amount":233104.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166927352},{"amount":1019.68,"local_amount":1379524.26,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:51:29Z","rounded_local_amount":1395534.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172193946}],"funded_date":"2010-05-02T20:17:52Z","paid_date":"2010-10-15T10:51:29Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lorne Warwick","image":215175}},{"id":195345,"name":"Josephine","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Josephine B. is from the village of Talakag Bukidnon.

In 1990, he lost his job because of the crisis. He had been a cashier at a big local supermarket (Presto). He began at that point to sell kerosene and to rent out plastic chairs, and after 2006, to sell phone time and telephone recharge cards. \r\n\r\nWith this loan he is intending to renew his stock of plastic chairs, add another 1000 liters of kerosene to his stock as well as a large quantity of telephone recharge cards from various mobile phone companies. It is true that selling the cards does not bring in much profit, but he intends to buy them wholesale this time, and to deliver several liters of kerosene at a time to retailers, avoiding finding himself out of stock, and getting new plastic chairs. \r\n\r\nFor the future, he thinks it is not yet too late for him to become a big businessman. His greatest dream is to open up a service station.

Olivia is 21 years old and lives in the town of Kasubi in the Kampala East region of Uganda.  She is single and has no children.  Olivia has a business of selling second-hand clothing, which she has had for one year.         \r\n\r\nOlivia is requesting a loan of 200,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda.  The loan will be used to buy more clothes.  Olivia plans to use the loan in order to expand her business by buying more clothes and generate a profit in order to change her lifestyle.  In the future, Olivia hopes to get married and have a good life.\r\n\r\nNote to lenders: BRAC Uganda has recently begun posting a new loan product to Kiva which funds young entrepreneurs in BRAC\u2019s Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program.  This Kiva borrower is receiving a new ELA loan. The ELA program first provides disadvantaged adolescents, usually girls who are out of school, with livelihood training and financial literacy skills.  Afterward, ELA participants can receive microfinance loans to expand their small businesses.  These loans offer adolescents a unique chance to access finance at a young age and improve their prospects for the future, and target a segment of the population not typically served by traditional microfinance.  Kiva is privileged to partner with BRAC Uganda in posting these new loans, and give Kiva lenders the opportunity to fund deserving young entrepreneurs and support a promising new sector in microfinance.\r\n \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":100,"image":{"id":578280,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Used

She decided to start a food truck because she wanted to make buying excellent food more convenient for people.  Norma and her husband used to grab breakfast at food trucks before work.  These experiences helped Norma learn about this model of food production.  Bistro Six is successful because of the commitment of Norma and her family.  Her oldest son, Javier, is the executive chef and her stepdaughter, Stacey, is the sous chef.  \r\n\r\nNorma says that receiving the loan from ACCION Texas-Louisiana could not have been more perfectly timed.  She and her husband had depleted personal funds to remodel the truck, but the truck was still not outfitted with kitchen supplies.  They used part of the loan to pay off the remodeling, which included upgrading the electric wires, adding the logo, and buying a new generator.  The day that Norma received the loan, she and her son went shopping for all the pots, pans, and other necessary cooking equipment.  As soon as they bought the supplies, the family \u201cstarted cooking and didn\u2019t stop for four days\u201d until the food truck\u2019s opening.  Norma and her family would not have been able to achieve their goal without the loan.   \r\n\r\nNorma says the most difficult part of owning a food truck is finding a legal place to park.  She has struggled to negotiate the rules surrounding food trucks in San Antonio.  Some challenges are that there are not many curb spaces to fit a food truck and that the truck is not allowed to park within 300 feet of another eatery.  In order to work through these challenges, Norma and a number of other food truck owners have come together to support one another.  They are all parking on one piece of land and are calling the area the Boardwalk on Bulverde.  Norma says that the food trucks are not competition for one another, but rather are fighting through the same problems and banding together to come up with solutions.  \r\n\r\nNorma believes that it is important for anyone who has an entrepreneurial inkling to recognize his or her talent and act on it.  Norma says, \u201conce you have a dream, never quit and believe that you can do it.\u201d

She is 45 years old. Beatriz is the group leader of a 4-member group loan offered by ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is Beatriz G.'s Group.\r\n\r\nBeatriz is married and has 4 school-aged children. To make a living, Beatriz owns and operates a general store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from selling a variety of different products in the local community. Beatriz has been engaged in her business for over 20 years and earns approximately 5,000 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Beatriz joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Beatriz has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Beatriz is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase new items to expand her product offering. This loan will be the 3rd loan taken out by Beatriz from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay the tuition fees for her children. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 38 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1275,"image":{"id":690768,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

She is a single mother and has four children who are grown up and independent.  One of her daughters supports her with the household expenses and in her business.  Ana Maria's plan for the future is to improve the infrastructure of her business.  For ten years, she has been selling baked goods such as 'rosquillas' (a type of doughnut), bread, 'picos' (mini breadsticks), etc.  The biggest difficulty that she faces is the rise in the price of products such as flour, eggs and milk.  This means that she has to make things a little smaller and accommodate her customers so that she doesn't have to stop selling.  Ana Maria started her business through her own efforts.

She lives with her three children: a 19-year old daughter who is studying commerce at a technical school; another daughter, 16 years old who is in high school. And a 12-year old son who is in grade five.\r\n\r\nAs a family tradition they buy and raise pigs. They are purchased as piglets and they raise them and sell them when they have grown. She carries out her business from a space on the property. Given the financial needs of her family and the fact that raising pigs does not permit them to have a steady source of income, she decided 8 years ago to sell fashion jewelry and cosmetics by catalogue. This business has permitted her family to live in a dignified manner and to send her children to school.\r\n\r\nTo feed her pigs, she buys the whey that is produced from cow milk when it is processed. And she busy every day from the daily producers in the region. The concentrated feed is purchased from the city, located 25 kilometers from her home. She uses public buses to transport her products and then she pays a pick-up truck service to take her products all the way to her house from the bus stop. She makes her purchases once per week, especially because the product loses its quality if bought in larger volumes. The jewelry and the cosmetics are also purchased in the city.\r\n\r\nShe requests a loan to keep raising her 20 pigs, which are 6 weeks old. She needs to feed her sows and a boar. The other part of her loan will be used to purchase more and new products for resale. This will let Ruth continue with her income generating activities for the support of her family. She must not stop selling the jewelry and cosmetics because they generate the constant source of income for the family.\r\n\r\nRuth wishes to support her children in the medium-long term, so that they will earn a technical career and so that they will earn themselves a living. She also wants to build adequate barns for the pigs and to build a house that was inherited to her by her mother. She currently lives in her brother's house.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":895525,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

She is married and mother of three children (two girls who are two and eight years old, and a boy who is four years old). She lives in Jr. Puno, district of Mazocruz, province of El Collao, Puno.\r\n\r\nShe is a member of the community bank \"Generaci\u00f3n 2000\" in Mazocruz. She decided to join the community bank five years ago because she lacked capital to stock her grocery shop. With the initial credit of 300 Soles, she bought one bag of rice, one bag of sugar, etc. At six years of age, her father abandoned her and she had to go out to sell gelatin. From age nine to eighteen, she sold groceries in the markets of Tupala, Huacullani, Huaitiri, and others. At age nineteen she married her husband and they installed their grocery shops. With a capital accumulated, she presently sells fuel, alpaca, llama, and sheep meat, mostly to the wholesalers of Tacna.\r\n\r\nWith this loan of 1500 Soles, which she will repay in four months, she proposes to buy one cylinder of fuel with 600 Soles and with the rest of the capital she will buy alpacas for the sale of meat. Each alpaca costs 180 to 200 Soles.\r\n\r\nHer goal is to have a very beautiful home in Mazocruz, set up a commercial shop, hire employees to attend to the public, and she will just administer it. Her goal is also that her kids study and become professionals.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jay Osborne, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":208878,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Buy fuel and alpacas for the cost of meat.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Mazocruz, Puno","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.75 -69.733333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":72,"posted_date":"2008-10-14T16:40:26Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":525,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Yaneth Melania","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-10-28T22:40:32Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-11-28T08:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2008-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2009-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2009-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":375}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":131.25},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":131.25},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":131.25},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":131.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":131.25,"local_amount":375,"processed_date":"2008-11-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-16T07:57:28Z","rounded_local_amount":391.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5331013},{"amount":131.25,"local_amount":375,"processed_date":"2008-12-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T00:55:33Z","rounded_local_amount":391.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9951383},{"amount":131.25,"local_amount":375,"processed_date":"2009-01-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T13:49:02Z","rounded_local_amount":391.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":10224410},{"amount":131.25,"local_amount":375,"processed_date":"2009-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-18T08:07:14Z","rounded_local_amount":391.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20417133}],"funded_date":"2008-10-14T22:40:32Z","paid_date":"2009-03-18T08:07:14Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jay Osborne","image":883556}},{"id":71605,"name":"Suraiya","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Suraiya baji is the wife of Mr. S. and lives in a historical place named Yadgar in the city of Lahore, Pakistan.

Marry currently earns about 150 USD from her business. She is requesting a loan of 225 USD in order to purchase additional stocks of beer, soda and other drinks. In the future, she plans to expand her business. Marry thanks you for your support.\r\n\r\n<p>SELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.

Don Virgilio, Medellin, Cebu. She earns her living by operating a fishing  business.  Her husband, Elenito P., who is 47 years old, works as a plumber to earn his living and also helps in his wife's business activities.  They have seven children between the ages of 3 and 24. Three of them have their own jobs while the other four children are currently going to school.\r\n\r\nGina joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2005 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past seven loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Gina has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. \r\n\r\nHer previous loan of 23,000 PHP helped her earn a monthly profit of about $342, thus uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her 8th cycle loan, she is borrowing 23,000PHP which she intends to use to buy fishing gear so that she can continue to save up for the future education of her children. Gina P. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She is 29 years old. Erwina is married and has one school-aged child. To make a living, Erwina works in a family member's fishing business. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from harvesting and selling farm-raised fish in the local community. Erwina has been engaged in her business for more than a year and earns approximately 10,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2011, Erwina joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Erwina is requesting a new loan of 15,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase fishing equipment including hooks and nets. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Erwina from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay her children's tuition fees. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.
