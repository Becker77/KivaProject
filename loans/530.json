She has 4 years of experience in this business. Lofi needs a loan of WST $2700 to purchase general farm supplies & equipment.  She plans to use the profit from her business (estimated to be 300 talas or US $125 per week) to improve and expand her business.\r\n\r\nLofi joined SPBD to gain access to financial services.  Most of SPBD's clients are unable to borrow from commercial banks, because they lack collateral.  This is Lofi's 4th loan with SPBD. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*SPBD evaluates the living conditions of each of its borrowers.  Generally, a loan manager evaluates a variety of social metrics on a scale out of 3 (the higher the number, the better off the person is) and these are averaged for the \"\"overall social metric score.\"\"  For example, a 3 out of 3 on \"\"level of education\"\" would mean that the borrower has graduated from university.  \r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.

She is 59 years old. Vivian is married and has three adult children. To make a living, Vivian owns & operates a transport business. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from providing jeepney transport services to local community members. Vivian has been engaged in her business for over five years and earns approximately 9000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 30000, Vivian joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Vivian has successfully repaid a previous loan from PMPC. Vivian is requesting a new loan of 30000 PHP, which will be used to repair a transport vehicle used in the business & registration renewal. This loan will be the eighth loan taken out by Vivian from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

For this reason, Marilyn is again requesting to borrow a loan from Kiva lenders amounting to PHP 8,000. According to her, she must work hard for her family.

She is a woman worthy of being imitated.  After not being able to cover her home expenses by being a housewife, she used her savings of about USD $100, which she had for emergencies, and started her business. IMON International has supported Suraiyokhon by facilitating loans to her for the last three years. In spite of the strong competition in her type of business, her results have been improving and therefore it has been proposed to continue granting her credit. Currently Suraiyokhon needs a loan of $1000 USD to increase the range of her goods for sale. She and her family appreciate your support in helping her improve her business.  \r\n<p>\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n<p>\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\nIMON's History\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She plans to buy feed for her animals so that she can sell them later in her community.  \r\n\r\nHer inspiration to start this business came to her recently.  She wanted to have income for her household so that she could cover a few daily expenses.  With the profits she earns from selling chickens, Idolina is able to save more and generate a better household income.  Her dream is to save and continue working so that she can buy materials in order to begin the construction of her house since her existing home is made of wood planks.  Prior to joining the program, she met with other groups who told her about the loans.  Idolina was very interested, so she found two other individuals to form a group.\r\n\r\nThe members of the group are as follows:\r\n\u2022\tIdolina P.

This leads to poor financial support, hence poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. SELFINA buys and leases equipment to women.

She did so for over a year and a half but kept being deceived by providers who would give her boxes with ripe fruits on top, but rotten fruit beneath, which made her lose money. Since her children were so young she decided to leave this business and open a small shop in her home, which she and her mother have run for the past year and a half.

Sekarang setelah Ni Komang Sukra Ratmini mendapat tambahan modal ia dapat melayani para konsumen lebih banyak lagi dengan keuntungan bersih perhari  mencapai Rp.150.000,- yang dulunya hanya memperoleh keuntungan bersih perhari Rp 50.000. Usaha warung ini ditekuninya dengan harapan  kedepannya usaha warung dapat lebih meningkat dan menjadi lebih besar lagi dari sekarang.","en":"Ni Komang Sukra Ratmini opens a small stall in front of her house. She has been in this business since she got married. She decided to open a small stall because there was no other stall in her neighborhood. <p>\r\nShe sells various stuffs in her stall such as snacks and vegetables. She opens the stall from 7 am to 6 pm everyday. As she has the stall in her house so she still can do the daily house chores. <p>\r\nShe needs additional working capital as her customers are increasing so she needs to stock up more merchandises.

several years. He is married and the father of 4 children. Mirzoali learned farming business from a young age and now has a lot of experience. It is very important to point out that his business requires a lot of effort, which is why he dedicates himself to growing potatoes, tomatoes, cucumbers, etc. This requires a lot of exposure to the sun as well as moving the product long distances. The reason why Mirzoali is requesting a loan from IMON International is to invest in technological assistance in cultivation. With this loan he will be able to succeed and have better opportunities for the sale of his products after the harvest. \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International:\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists, and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New Western culture and Central Asian traditions. But Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

He is a driver, and his salary is low.\r\n\r\nThey are saving because they are starting to build their house.  They want to finish it soon to have more privacy and to be in better conditions.

She sells for cash and for credit every two weeks on payday.

With her projected earnings, Miss D. will assist her mother with household expenses and take care of her own needs.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Ren\u00e9 McConnell, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":498664,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Resupply products","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SN","country":"Senegal","town":"THIES","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"14.783333 -16.966667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":108,"posted_date":"2010-03-02T10:50:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Fatoumata N\u00e9n\u00e9","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-02-24T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":200000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2010-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2010-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2010-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2010-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2010-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2010-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2010-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2010-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2010-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":20000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":85,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T12:35:47Z","rounded_local_amount":40963.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136759249},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2010-05-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-18T08:23:33Z","rounded_local_amount":20481.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144790760},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2010-06-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-17T08:36:31Z","rounded_local_amount":20481.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151971197},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T12:16:13Z","rounded_local_amount":20481.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159708465},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2010-08-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-24T08:41:14Z","rounded_local_amount":20481.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166922525},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-04T14:22:46Z","rounded_local_amount":20481.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172189031},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2010-10-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-23T12:00:43Z","rounded_local_amount":20481.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177484469},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2010-11-24T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-17T11:57:56Z","rounded_local_amount":20481.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182620712},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2010-12-24T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-11T14:35:21Z","rounded_local_amount":20481.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188758306}],"funded_date":"2010-03-02T13:10:42Z","paid_date":"2011-02-11T14:35:21Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ren\u00e9 McConnell","image":467423}},{"id":185860,"name":"Erika De Los \u00c1ngeles","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La Sra.

This loan will, for now, help him restock his business with new shoes, shoe polish and gum boots for resale, thus enabling him to earn more sales revenue.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":551060,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Shoe Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To purchase new shoes, gumboots and shoe polish for his business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Rukungiri","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"2 33","type":"point"}},"partner_id":84,"posted_date":"2010-06-09T13:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":750,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Robert","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"David","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"David","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jaamada","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"James","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-05-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":1700000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":283333.33},{"due_date":"2010-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":283333.33},{"due_date":"2010-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":283333.33},{"due_date":"2010-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":283333.33},{"due_date":"2010-10-27T07:00:00Z","amount":283333.33},{"due_date":"2010-11-27T08:00:00Z","amount":283333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":242.65,"local_amount":550000,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-20T07:46:52Z","rounded_local_amount":556268.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":152662546},{"amount":7.35,"local_amount":16667,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:47:16Z","rounded_local_amount":16856.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159689326},{"amount":125,"local_amount":283332.99,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:47:54Z","rounded_local_amount":286562.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166903479},{"amount":110.29,"local_amount":250000.01,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-16T09:16:26Z","rounded_local_amount":252849.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172296954},{"amount":94.1,"local_amount":213284,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T15:35:07Z","rounded_local_amount":215714.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177467253},{"amount":170.61,"local_amount":386716,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:22:14Z","rounded_local_amount":391123.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182605408}],"funded_date":"2010-06-19T15:55:16Z","paid_date":"2010-12-15T15:22:14Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jeff Avery","image":233371}},{"id":210440,"name":"Richard","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Richard T. is from Iligan City.

Los principales frutos que injerta son el cacao, c\u00edtricos y mango. Lo que m\u00e1s le gusta de su trabajo es ver crecer las semillas de los frutos. Seg\u00fan afirma son pocos los que se dedican a la elaboraci\u00f3n de injertos; existe gran demanda porque la mayor\u00eda de los agricultores buscan injertos para sus plantaciones. Pero el principal inconveniente de Pedro, es el capital de trabajo, ya que para el proceso necesita un promedio de 10 mil soles. \u00c9l pertenece al banco comunal \u201cGedeon de los olivos\u201d, y este es el cuarto cr\u00e9dito con MFP, donde siente que puede encontrar el apoyo que tanto necesita para poder seguir con su actividad.

He preaches the word of God and although he does not live with his family, he feels fortunate to live at the church they attend along with their friends. The church is located in the town of Sangani, in the central Peruvian rainforest zone. Pedro earns a living selling natural medicines as well as stainless steel cookware. However, his third job, which he is most passionate about, is grafting plants. He does this with the help of an assistant. The main plants he grafts are cocoa beans, citrus fruits, and mangos. What he likes most about this job is seeing the seeds grow into trees. According to Pedro, there are very few people who work in grafting, yet there is a large demand since the majority of farmers seek out grafts for their farms. The main setback for Pedro is working capital since he needs an average of 10,000 soles for the process. He belongs to the \"Gedeon de los Olivos\" Communal Bank. This is his fourth loan with Microfinanzas Prisma, through which he feels he can find the support he so badly needs to be able to continue his work. Pedro is preparing for the cocoa bean planting season, and for this reason he is planning to buy cocoa beans with the loan he is requesting, which he will place is large black bags for making the grafts.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":925,"image":{"id":728039,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy cocoa beans","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-03-12T06:30:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":925,"lender_count":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Pedro ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-03-03T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-29T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-29T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-28T08:00:00Z","amount":2500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":925}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":925,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:43:39Z","rounded_local_amount":2561.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244621050}],"funded_date":"2011-03-22T21:21:00Z","paid_date":"2011-12-15T10:43:39Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sarah Shimmin","image":null}},{"id":284201,"name":"Akos Mawusse","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Madame Mawusse  est mari\u00e9e  avec un enfant \u00e0 charge.

Before joining One Acre Fund,  John was only able to harvest 3 \u00bd bags of maize on \u00bd an acre of land.\r\n\r\nWith this loan, One Acre Fund will purchase fertilizer, seeds, and other important inputs to distribute to John and his group during Kenya\u2019s next planting season in February 2012. The distribution of farming inputs is part of One Acre Fund\u2019s integrated agriculture package, which includes training, reliable input supply (such as fertilizer and seeds), credit and insurance.\r\n\r\nWith income from maize sales, John will save for the future in order to hire another plot of farmland for more production and he will invest in livestock rearing.\r\n\r\nIn 2012, the members of Mbomele group will each plant maize plots of between \u00bd and 1 acre of land.\r\n\r\nIn the photograph above, John is pictured with his group members. Standing on the far left is the field officer.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":927315,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To source farming inputs, such as seeds and fertilizer, at low prices for the 2012 planting season.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Webuye","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.616667 34.766667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2011-11-26T02:40:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":500,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"David","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jane","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Carol","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"John","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gladys","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sussy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Shadrack","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-11-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":44100,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44100}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":500}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":500,"local_amount":44100,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-27T10:16:53Z","rounded_local_amount":44925,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315680978}],"funded_date":"2011-12-27T05:14:16Z","paid_date":"2012-11-27T10:16:53Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":366191,"name":"Umurzok","description":{"languages":["ru","en"],"texts":{"ru":"\u0423\u043c\u0443\u0440\u0437\u043e\u043a \u043c\u0443\u0436\u0447\u0438\u043d\u0430 35 \u043b\u0435\u0442, \u0436\u0435\u043d\u0430\u0442, \u0438\u043c\u0435\u0435\u0442 \u043f\u044f\u0442\u0435\u0440\u044b\u0445 \u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0439. \u0421\u0430\u043c \u043f\u043e \u0441\u043f\u0435\u0446\u0438\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438 \u043c\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0435\u0440 \u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c \u0438 \u0434\u043e\u043f\u043e\u043b\u043d\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e \u043a \u044d\u0442\u043e\u043c\u0443 \u043e\u043d \u0437\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u043e\u0442\u043a\u043e\u0440\u043c\u043e\u043c \u0438 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0430\u0436\u0435\u0439 \u0441\u043a\u043e\u0442\u0430. \u0421\u0435\u0439\u0447\u0430\u0441 \u0443 \u043d\u0435\u0433\u043e \u043c\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0433\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0432 \u043c\u0435\u043b\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0440\u043e\u0433\u0430\u0442\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0441\u043a\u043e\u0442\u0430. \u041d\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u043b\u0443\u0447\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043a\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0438\u0442 \u043e\u043d \u0445\u043e\u0447\u0435\u0442 \u0443\u0432\u0435\u043b\u0438\u0447\u0438\u0442\u044c \u043a\u043e\u043b\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e \u0441\u043a\u043e\u0442\u0430. \u0416\u0435\u043d\u0430 \u0434\u043e\u043c\u043e\u0445\u043e\u0437\u044f\u0439\u043a\u0430, \u0437\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0432\u043e\u0441\u043f\u0438\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435\u043c \u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0439 \u0438 \u0437\u0430\u043e\u0434\u043d\u043e \u043f\u043e\u043c\u043e\u0433\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u043c\u0443\u0436\u0443 \u0443\u0445\u0430\u0436\u0438\u0432\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0437\u0430 \u0441\u043a\u043e\u0442\u043e\u043c. \u0423\u043c\u0443\u0440\u0437\u043e\u043a \u0441 \u0434\u0435\u0442\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u043c\u043e\u0433\u0430\u043b \u043e\u0442\u0446\u0443 \u043f\u043e \u0443\u0445\u043e\u0434\u0443 \u0437\u0430 \u0441\u043a\u043e\u0442\u043e\u043c, \u043f\u043e\u044d\u0442\u043e\u043c\u0443 \u0443 \u043d\u0435\u0433\u043e \u0435\u0441\u0442\u044c \u043e\u043f\u044b\u0442 \u0432 \u044d\u0442\u043e\u043c \u0431\u0438\u0437\u043d\u0435\u0441\u0435. \u041e\u043d \u0440\u0430\u0434, \u0447\u0442\u043e \u0438\u043c\u0435\u0435\u0442 \u0432\u043e\u0437\u043c\u043e\u0436\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044c \u043f\u043e\u043b\u0443\u0447\u0438\u0442\u044c \u043a\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0438\u0442 \u0438 \u0441\u043e\u0442\u0440\u0443\u0434\u043d\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0443 \u0441 \u043d\u0430\u043c\u0438.","en":"Umurzok is a 35 year-old married man, who has five children.

All of the members of the Centro Agricola de Baba Communal Bank are part of an Association of Rice Farmers in the county of Baba in rural Ecuador. Their association works cooperatively to cultivate rice and commercialize the product after it has grown. As an association, Centro Agricola helps the farmers by providing access to machinery and training services. The farmers from Centro Agricola have received special instruction on financial responsibility and accounting from Codemicro, an organization that specializes in training programs geared towards the rural sector. <\/p>\r\n<p>The members of Centro Agricola de Baba will use the micro-loans to prepare their lands and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each others' guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the Centro Agricola de Baba Association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many micro-finance programs, but Mifex believes that is imperative for the communities we works with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties. <\/p>\r\n<p><em>Below is more information about Baba compiled by Luis Crespo and Robert Edgar of the Mifex team when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. <\/em><\/p>\r\n<h4>Economy of Baba<\/h4>\r\n<p>The people of Baba have been organized since the days of Gran Colombia when Ecuador was yet to be a country. The area has always been popular because of the extremely productive lands that gave way to cultivation of cacao for decades. Now Baba is a county in the province of Los Rios in the coastal region of Ecuador. For most of the latter part of the 20th Century it was a cacao and banana producing sector. Most of the surrounding areas of Baba in Los Rios are owned by big large companies such as Dole, but Baba is a sector characterized the small and informal farms. <\/p>\r\n<p>Rice production has now turned into the main economic activity of the area as about 80% of the people are rice farmers. Cacao is still very popular in the area, but because of the long cultivation cycle people prefer to invest in rice. The lands in Baba are very fertile though, and most farmers in the sector often grow other crops, such as plantains and soy beans, as secondary sources of income.  Many farmers also keep livestock as emergency sources of food and income, commonly resorting to selling a chicken or pig if they are in need of cash. <\/p>\r\n<h4>Rice Farming <\/h4>\r\n<p>Most of the people in the Baba area are small farmers. They produce about 80 sacks of rice per hectare of land. In order to farm they first must prepare the lands by removing weeds, plowing and leveling the lands. This is the most difficult part for the farmers in Baba, who often lack the necessary machinery to properly plough the lands for rice production. After appropriately preparing the lands, the farmers fill an area with water to form what is known as a paddy field, because rice is a very water intensive crop. The rice seeds are either dispersed freely (the process is known as boleo in Spanish) or hand sowed. Once the rice has grown, most farmers rent machinery that helps them gather their production. <\/p>\r\n<h4>Access to Credit<\/h4>\r\n<p>One of the biggest struggles in the area has been the lack of credit due to the absence of any type of financial institution. Because people do not count on formal financial finance, they have turned to loan sharks for financing. They have been affected by expensive lines of credit that exceed 100% interest a year and can be as expensive as 240%. Intermediaries also exploit the farmers because of their outstanding debt. Farmers also lack skills and knowledge to commercialize their products and pay fair prices for their crops. <\/p>\r\n<h4>Risks<\/h4>\r\n<p>The largest risk in the sector is due to absence of watering systems. Although Baba is in the province \u201cLos Rios\u201d (the rivers) there is severe problem with access to water. The lack of infrastructure in the sector does not allow the small farmers to benefit from the presence of the many rivers in the area. If the winter season is too dry, it is likely that the lands will not be sufficiently fertile for rice production in the summer. On the other hand, if there is too much rain there are no drainage systems to prevent flooding and the crops are often ruined. Generally speaking though, Baba is a very productive sector where the lands yield all types of products including rice, cacao, corn, watermelons, plantains, and soy beans. <\/p>\r\n<h4>Loan Use<\/h4>\r\n<p>The loans in this sector will be used to to buy soil, seeds, fertilizer and insecticides. Many of the loans will also go towards renting machinery and equipment necessary to effectively work and prepare the fields. The loan repayment schedule is different from the typical micro-entrepreneur because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures. Mifex asks our rural clients only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 6 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the seventh and final month. <\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":30438,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Fertilizer and seeds for rice farming","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Guayaquil","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.166667 -79.9","type":"point"}},"partner_id":7,"posted_date":"2007-04-19T21:54:54Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1200,"lender_count":4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Angela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-05-04T04:04:12Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1200,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":1200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":200}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":200}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":200,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2007-06-08T09:15:54Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T22:50:51Z","rounded_local_amount":200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":21441},{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-07-13T22:36:54Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T22:50:51Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":31811},{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-09-07T19:31:47Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T22:50:51Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":51900},{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-10-26T00:15:37Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T22:50:51Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":71911},{"amount":816,"local_amount":816,"processed_date":"2008-01-03T22:10:06Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T22:50:51Z","rounded_local_amount":816,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":107771}],"funded_date":"2007-04-20T04:04:12Z","paid_date":"2008-01-03T22:10:06Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":12946,"name":"Abdulai","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"55 year old Abdulai is married with three children.

She belongs to the Auroras in action community bank.  Santos studied until the second year of elementary school, which equates to third grade, because her mother was poor, she did not have a father and had to work since she was very young.  She married, but 7 years ago was widowed.  She has 5 children, 4 work and only 1 depends on her now because he is still a student.  She began her business by selling food.  She later sold gas and now also sells beer.  She is thankful for the Manuel Ramos movement because thanks to it she could obtain loans easily.  Santos operates her business out of her house, and now counts on a partner.  Her first loan was 300 soles and she returned itin 4 months.  With this loan she expanded her business and purchased gas which she later sold.  With the current loan of 1,000 soles, which she will repay in 6 months, she plans on investing in beer.  Santos dreams of watching her youngest son become a professional, as her other children could not become professionals for economic reasons.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jordan Shanker, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":215298,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Purchase beer to sell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Salaverry - Trujillo - La Libertad","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":72,"posted_date":"2008-10-26T23:10:15Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Santos","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-11-10T02:51:11Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2009-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2009-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2009-03-09T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2009-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2009-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":166.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.35}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":58.33,"local_amount":166.67,"processed_date":"2008-12-09T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T00:43:44Z","rounded_local_amount":177.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9951501},{"amount":58.33,"local_amount":166.67,"processed_date":"2009-01-09T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T13:41:59Z","rounded_local_amount":177.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":10224528},{"amount":58.33,"local_amount":166.67,"processed_date":"2009-02-09T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T19:45:30Z","rounded_local_amount":177.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20417250},{"amount":58.33,"local_amount":166.67,"processed_date":"2009-03-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:11:46Z","rounded_local_amount":177.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27110835},{"amount":58.33,"local_amount":166.67,"processed_date":"2009-04-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:14:54Z","rounded_local_amount":177.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36006221},{"amount":58.35,"local_amount":166.65,"processed_date":"2009-05-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T00:41:12Z","rounded_local_amount":177.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44590156}],"funded_date":"2008-10-27T01:51:11Z","paid_date":"2009-06-16T00:41:12Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jordan Shanker","image":null}},{"id":74410,"name":"Khmao","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Khmao N. is a 28-year-old villager who lives with her husband and her three young children in Damnak Rovang village in Takeo Province, Cambodia.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

This is 70-year-old Maria Landi P. from Morogoro. She is widowed with five children between the ages of 12 and 25.\n\nMaria has been running a milk business since 2008. Selling milk is a common business for Tanzanian women, especially Masai women. (the Masai are a tribe found in the northern part of Tanzania). Masai people do not cultivate farms but they own large numbers of cows, goats and sheep. One person can have more than one hundred cows and more than two hundred goats.\n\nThey sell their milk in order to get money so that they can buy other food such as maize and beans and to meet other expenses. The milk business is a very successful business because milk is in high demand by many people. Milk contains all the necessary ingredients and vitamins needed for health.\n\nMaria works at her business for 5 to 8 hours per day, 3 days per week, and is assisted by her children. She is requesting a loan of 300,000 Tsh in order to purchase cups, bowls and baskets for her business. In the future, she plans to provide more litres of milk for her customers.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility.\n\nCustoms and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.\n\nOne of the primary advantages of micro-leasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\n"}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":516510,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Milk Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To purchase cups, bowls, baskets and other vessels  for carrying milk as well as animal feeder .","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Morogoro","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-6.816667 37.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":225,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":300000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2010-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2010-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2010-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2010-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2010-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2011-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2011-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":25000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jeff Avery","image":233371}},{"id":194069,"name":"Rebecca","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rebecca N. is from the village of Binahalan, Gingoog City.

He lives in his mother's house along with his smaller brothers.  What he wants most is to improve his quality of life.  He works arduously every day in his fields.  Federico tries to change the life that he has at present.  Along with his mother he sows beans, corn, maize and potatoes bi-annually, which he sells in the markets of Tarma and la Merced, since it is there that he obtains better profits.  He has been doing this activity for 15 years and considers that he likes to protect his crops from plagues.  Without doubt, the most difficult thing is to carry his crop to the markets where he sells them, since the bags that he carries are very heavy.  His hope is to improve the quality of his products and thus to obtain a better income.  This is his second loan with MFP.  He feels that this loan will be very beneficial for him in his growth as a farmer.  In his communal group he is a supportive and very active associate.  With the two thousand new soles that he requests, he will buy more pesticides and fertilizer in order to improve the productivity of his small farm.  \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Barbara (B) Brown, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":543386,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy fertilizer and pesticides to improve the productivity of his farm","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-05-22T06:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":725,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Federico ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-04-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-29T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":725}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":498.07,"local_amount":1374,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T08:52:35Z","rounded_local_amount":1416.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195886448},{"amount":226.93,"local_amount":626,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:36:50Z","rounded_local_amount":645.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201327845}],"funded_date":"2010-05-24T01:34:16Z","paid_date":"2011-04-15T11:36:50Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"B Brown","image":120650}},{"id":206360,"name":"Them","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Every day, Them L. wakes up before dawn and travels to where the fishermen work.

personal trust between the members.\u00a0 However, their financial resources are limited to the contributions of their members, frequently subsistence farmers with very little disposable income.\u00a0

Today, BRAC has emerged as an independent, virtually self-financed paradigm in sustainable human development. It is one of the largest Southern development organizations employing over 100,000 people, 61% of which are women, and working with the twin objectives of poverty alleviation and empowerment of the poor. Diagnosing poverty in human terms and recognizing its multifaceted nature, BRAC approaches poverty alleviation with a holistic approach.\r\n<br><br>The successes of BRAC in the international development arena have stimulated a series of discussions, both with African delegations, who have visited BRAC programs, and with donors who work in Asia and Africa. Both the African countries and the donors have encouraged BRAC to join the development campaign in Africa to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and more recently to join the campaign of \u201cending poverty\u201d, which is an area where Africa represents the greatest global challenge.\r\n<br><br> In Uganda, BRAC registered as a Non Government Organization (NGO) in January 2006 to undertake programs in Education, Health, Water & Sanitation, Agriculture & Livestock and Microfinance. The Microfinance and Education are the pioneer programs launched in Uganda and, as of July 2007, had served 21,273 borrowers and enrolled 1,155 adolescents in its education

SELFINA has taken a leading role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions as they lack tangible collateral assets. This leads to poor financial support, hence poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. SELFINA buys and leases equipment to women. Where a client needs working capital SELFINA buys equipment from said client, extending a loan to her, then leasing back the same equipment\u2014a process called a sale and leaseback arrangement."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":119932,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"To expand her range of clothing.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mwanza","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.516667 32.9","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-02-03T21:30:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":450,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hamisa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-02-18T06:17:39Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2008-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2008-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2008-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2008-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2008-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2008-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2008-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2008-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2008-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2009-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2009-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":41666.63}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2008-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":38,"local_amount":42222.22,"processed_date":"2008-03-18T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:29:47Z","rounded_local_amount":44194,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":160814},{"amount":38,"local_amount":42222.22,"processed_date":"2008-04-18T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:30:30Z","rounded_local_amount":44194,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":185871},{"amount":38,"local_amount":42222.22,"processed_date":"2008-05-18T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:33:17Z","rounded_local_amount":44194,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":213601},{"amount":38,"local_amount":42222.22,"processed_date":"2008-06-18T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:35:48Z","rounded_local_amount":44194,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":241813},{"amount":38,"local_amount":42222.22,"processed_date":"2008-07-18T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:39:23Z","rounded_local_amount":44194,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270798},{"amount":38,"local_amount":42222.22,"processed_date":"2008-08-18T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:42:53Z","rounded_local_amount":44194,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":300007},{"amount":222,"local_amount":246666.67,"processed_date":"2008-09-11T14:07:37Z","settlement_date":"2008-09-22T07:14:07Z","rounded_local_amount":258186,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323966}],"funded_date":"2008-02-04T06:17:39Z","paid_date":"2008-09-22T07:14:07Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":37539,"name":"Srey Aun","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Srey Aun P. , 21, and her husband have been married for three years and have one son.

AMK has a delinquency rate of only 0.09% and AMK has a default rate of 0% to Kiva.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2025,"image":{"id":225986,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Transportation","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"

She does all the arranging of the wedding cake, the wedding clothes, and the decorations.  In Uganda, it is traditional for special gift baskets to be prepared and given to the bride and groom in a very ceremonial way at the wedding.  These baskets should be covered with decorations that match the decorations at the rest of the wedding.  All of the cars involved in a wedding also have some ribbon tied around that matches the wedding\u2019s colors.  Proscovia is responsible for all of these arrangements.   <P>\r\n\r\nFor the wedding clothes, Proscovia has a dress that she rents out for 100,000 USH.  This allows her to make a large profit because she can either loan her own, which makes her the most money, or she can rent one from a friend for about 40,000 USH. This means that she can earn anywhere between 60,000 \u2013 100,000 USH just on the clothing for the wedding.    Then for decorations she can earn anywhere from 80,000 \u2013 100,000 profit per wedding.  <P>\r\n\r\nProscovia has 2 workers that help her with all of the arrangements needed for this business.    She also has a side business selling women\u2019s tops and bracelets.  She employs two people who sell these items for her in the surrounding markets.    <P>\r\n\r\nProscovia and her husband have 3 kids together that they care for, and she has one, who is the oldest, that is just hers and that she provides everything for.  With the money that she makes, she is now able to send this oldest girl to boarding school.  This is a dream come true for her.    <P>\r\n\r\nProscovia is requesting a loan of 700,000 USH to purchase two veils for weddings she is coordinating this month.  She will also use part of the loan to buy some more women\u2019s tops and bracelets for re-sale.

AMK has a delinquency rate of only 0.09% and AMK has a default rate of 0% on Kiva. \n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":405703,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"By purchasing more fishes to resell to earn more income.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KH","country":"Cambodia","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 105","type":"point"}},"partner_id":109,"posted_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:37Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Vin","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"San","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mok","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Saron","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ron","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Pov","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-09-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KHR","disbursal_amount":2200000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":175000},{"due_date":"2009-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":175000},{"due_date":"2009-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":175000},{"due_date":"2010-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":175000},{"due_date":"2010-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":175000},{"due_date":"2010-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":175000},{"due_date":"2010-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":175000},{"due_date":"2010-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":975000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":243.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":350000,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T11:18:28Z","rounded_local_amount":363387.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103738917},{"amount":43.75,"local_amount":175000,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T11:36:45Z","rounded_local_amount":181693.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110626496},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":350000,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T10:18:35Z","rounded_local_amount":363387.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118023256},{"amount":331.25,"local_amount":1325000,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T08:06:39Z","rounded_local_amount":1375681.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128894722}],"funded_date":"2009-11-04T05:11:59Z","paid_date":"2010-04-15T08:06:39Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":148270,"name":"Herminia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Herminia A. is now 53 years old and married to her partner in life and in business, Celso A..

Sometimes they\u2019ll buy finished products like a bed made of bamboo. Then they will resell it, but most of the time they make and then sell the product or sometimes they do custom orders.

Abdukholik is 26 years old, living with his wife and two children. He has been breeding cattle for more than 5 years and he is trying to improve the breed in order to increase his prices. He invests time and money in the feed and medicines that the animals require. He enjoys this work, above all getting milk from his cows, which his wife sells in local markets. Abdukholik keeps going thanks to the help and enthusiasm of his children, along with his wife who helps him to care for the animals. Now Abdukholik needs a loan of $1100 USD to purchase more cattle to expand his business. With your help this will be possible.   \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

She is 33 years old. Laila is the group leader of a five-member group loan offered by ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nLaila is married and has four school-aged children. To make a living, Laila owns and operates a business raising crops. The main source of income for the business comes primarily from planting and harvesting  a variety of vegetables for sale. Laila has been engaged in her business for over 8 years and earns approximately 8,000 Philippines pesos (PHP) a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Laila joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Laila has successfully repaid a previous loan of 14,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase fertilizers such as manure. Laila is requesting a new loan of 15,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional seeds, seedlings and young crops to raise. This loan will be the fifth loan taken out by Laila from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 29 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisher folk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\nNote: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partners to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1675,"image":{"id":533157,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To

It is made up of four women who each have a different business. The group chose this name because they have been friends for many years.\r\n\r\nSe\u00f1ora Mar\u00eda Dolores Gomes L\u00f3pez is 56 years old, a single mother of five children, three of them daughters, and two of them sons. Four of her children are already married and only the youngest still lives with her. Deiser is 21 years old and is a student in a pre-university course. He is the only one who contributes to household expenses.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda has been selling groceries for the last ten years and all has gone well since the beginning. Together with her family she has made progress in life, and she has enough income to pay for food on a daily basis. She receives assistance from her one son who works in the fields, and she doesn\u2019t feel that she works alone.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda\u2019s motivation for working is to use her time to obtain money to get ahead, along with her family.

He is 48 this year and happily married with five children. His children are 27, 21, 19, 15 and 9 years old, respectively. All five of them are currently attending school. Paul lives with his family in Cape Coast, the regional capital of the Central Region of Ghana. Paul owns a welding company. He has been in business for the past 20 years. He is the founder of the company and has built the company up from scratch. Today, he has five permanent employees and more than 10 part-time workers. His company manufactures a whole range of products, including housing features and household appliances. His company is even able to remodel scrapped cars. Paul is beloved by the local community due to  his innovations. Prior to this invention, Ghanaians in his community used natural materials such as bamboo and palm leaves to build makeshift shelters for outdoor events such as funerals and soccer matches. These lacked structural integrity and did not provide adequate shelter in rain; in fact, when the rain came, people would abandon the shelter and run away! An extremely enterprising and creative man, Paul designed a cost-effective canopy comprising a metal framework with a waterproof canvas. This product was immensely well-received by consumers. Even then, he did not remain content with this breakthrough and has continually improved this product based on consumer feedback. He has since furnished the design with fluorescent light and electric fans, allowing these temporary shelters to provide not only safety, but also utility and comfort. Paul's most recent endeavor is the manufacturing of clean-cook stoves (a.k.a the Elsa biochar Stove) that utilise waste-products, such as palm-kennel shells, as fuel. This stove is the product of a research project by the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) Group of States and co-financed by the European Union (EU). He is now applying for a micro-loan to purchase raw materials such as metal plates in bulk to take advantage of large discount to reduce material cost. Paul is very ambitious and excited about this product. He has secured an agreement with local distributors and plans to sell these stoves to consumers in the entire Central Region, and eventually expand the market to the whole country. Your loan will go a long way, not just in helping Paul achieve his ambitions, but also in providing Ghanaians with a safer means of cooking that is free of indoor and outdoor pollution and reduces deforestation.\n\nPatrick is taking another loan because he needs it to buy additional raw material to complete his work.He will use the current loan to buy new set of equipments and new raw materials for the production of Elsa Biochar Clean Cook Stoves.The loan has help advance the nature of his business.The previous loan helped raised the living standards of his family. The lady who was part of the previous loan has relocated because of marriage hence the changes in membership."}},"status":"inactive","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":2048434,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Metal Shop","sector":"Manufacturing","themes":["Green"],"use":"to buy metal plates for the production of Elsa Biochar Clean Cook stoves for resale.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GH","country":"Ghana","town":"Cape Coast","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"5.1 -1.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":392,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":3950,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Patrick","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ebenezer","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kofi","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2016-01-08T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GHS","disbursal_amount":15000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":3950,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2016-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2016-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2016-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2016-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2016-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2016-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2016-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2016-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2016-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2016-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2017-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":1250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":329.17},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":329.17},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":329.17},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":329.17},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":329.17},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":329.17},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":329.17},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":329.17},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":329.16},{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":329.16},{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":329.16},{"due_date":"2017-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":329.16}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":689,"name":"Virginia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"<font size=\"3\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\">Virginia is an active member of Kabuta ladies in action and a hardworking business lady.

Teddy has already received and successfully repaid one loan from SELFINA, and she now seeks another loan in order to purchase additional stocks of soft drinks in bulk. Undoubtedly, Coca Cola\u00ae is one of the most recognized symbols or 'words\" in the world. Even in the most remote villages in Africa, there is usually some kind of \"bar\" selling Coke, Fanta, and Guinness; Teddy notes that Pepsi has made it to most African capitals but not to the less-populated areas, but she is sure that Pepsi is working on expanding into those areas too!). The hot weather makes soft drinks all the more appealing, which explains why selling soft drinks is such a popular venture regardless of whether you\u2019re the CEO of Coca Cola Ltd. in the United States or a micro-entrepreneur in Tanzania!\r\n\r\nAbout SELFINA:\r\nSELFINA is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through leasing and leaseback facilities as a practical way to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women. SELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through micro-leasing whereby SELFINA buys and leases equipment to women. Specifically, when a client needs working capital, SELFINA will purchase equipment from said client, extend a loan to her, and then lease the same equipment back to her \u2013 a process called a sale and leaseback arrangement. Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets; therefore, financial institutions do not consider Tanzanian women to be credit-worthy because they lack tangible assets that could serve as collateral. As a result, Tanzanian women with low income receive poor financial support and meager access to basic needs and services. SELFINA thanks you for your support."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":119955,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Soft Drinks","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To purchase additional stocks of soft drinks in bulk.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Dar es Salaam","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-6.8 39.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-02-02T15:30:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":700,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Teddy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-02-17T16:08:47Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":800000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":133333.33},{"due_date":"2008-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":133333.33},{"due_date":"2008-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":133333.33},{"due_date":"2008-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":133333.33},{"due_date":"2008-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":133333.33},{"due_date":"2008-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":133333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":116.67},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":116.67},{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":116.67},{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":116.67},{"due_date":"2008-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":116.67},{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":116.65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":117,"local_amount":133714.29,"processed_date":"2008-03-17T10:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-17T09:34:43Z","rounded_local_amount":136071,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":160126},{"amount":117,"local_amount":133714.29,"processed_date":"2008-04-17T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-17T09:34:43Z","rounded_local_amount":136071,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":185062},{"amount":117,"local_amount":133714.29,"processed_date":"2008-05-17T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-17T09:34:43Z","rounded_local_amount":136071,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":212762},{"amount":117,"local_amount":133714.29,"processed_date":"2008-06-17T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-17T09:34:43Z","rounded_local_amount":136071,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":240919},{"amount":117,"local_amount":133714.29,"processed_date":"2008-07-17T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-17T09:34:43Z","rounded_local_amount":136071,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":269839},{"amount":115,"local_amount":131428.57,"processed_date":"2008-08-17T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-17T09:34:43Z","rounded_local_amount":133745,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":298982}],"funded_date":"2008-02-03T16:08:47Z","paid_date":"2008-08-17T09:17:23Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":37555,"name":"Him","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"<p>Mrs. Him C. is 40 years old.

Namun begitu, disela sela kesibukan itu,  Ibu dari I Nengah Edi erawan  (9 Th ) ini juga memiliki satu usaha yaitu beternak babi .Bahkan hasil yang di dapat tak beda jauh dengan pendapatan suaminya. Pendapatan yang cukup untuk menambah biaya kebutuhan  hidup sehari-hari. Diawali dengan  2 ekor penggemukan yang di pelihara dalam waktu  6 bulan. Dulu Ni Made Wiarti bisa meraih keuntungan Rp. 700.000.- \/ panen . Namun setelah terjadinya perubahan perekonomian akibat kenaikan BBM semua barang barang pun ikut naik.  Begitu juga halnya dengan bibit babi maupun pakannya. Untuk membeli satu ekor bibit babi sekarang I Made Wiarti harus menyediakan uang Rp. 325.000.- belum lagi biaya pakan yang sangat tinggi. Namun, Ni Made Wiarti tak mau menyerah begitu saja walau dengan modal pinjaman dari Dinari, ia tetap menjalankan usahanya ini bahkan jumlah peliharaanya pun lebih banyak. Tentunya juga dengan harapan hasil panennya lebih banyak sehingga keuntungannya jadi meningkat. Dengan demikian Ni Made Wiarti bisa menabung  untuk persiapan biaya pendidikan anaknya."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":194659,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To purchase piglets and fodder","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Melaya, Bali","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":82,"posted_date":"2008-08-31T12:40:14Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ni Made Wiarti","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-09-14T14:32:27Z","disbursal_currency":"IDR","disbursal_amount":3500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":583333.33},{"due_date":"2008-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":583333.33},{"due_date":"2008-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":583333.33},{"due_date":"2009-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":583333.33},{"due_date":"2009-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":583333.33},{"due_date":"2009-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":583333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":66.65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":133.33,"local_amount":1166666.66,"processed_date":"2008-11-14T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-19T20:05:18Z","rounded_local_amount":1230575.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5308552},{"amount":133.33,"local_amount":1166666.66,"processed_date":"2009-01-14T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-03T09:02:17Z","rounded_local_amount":1230575.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14849775},{"amount":76.19,"local_amount":666666.68,"processed_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T17:45:31Z","rounded_local_amount":703186.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27080610},{"amount":57.15,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2009-05-01T06:59:59Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-19T08:23:56Z","rounded_local_amount":527389.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35973827}],"funded_date":"2008-08-31T14:32:27Z","paid_date":"2009-05-19T08:23:56Z","journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":66239,"name":"Berha Aurora","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La Se\u00f1ora Bertha, socia del Banco Comunal \u201cMujeres de la Colina II\u201d, vive en la Regi\u00f3n y Provincia de San Mart\u00edn, distrito de Banda de Shilcayo.

The money he requests is to buy insecticides to control the bad parts of his plants. \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Erin Hopkins, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":306871,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Compra de insecticidas","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-04-22T20:00:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":175,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"El\u00edas","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-03-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":175,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:46:49Z","rounded_local_amount":539.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63211483}],"funded_date":"2009-04-22T21:25:26Z","paid_date":"2009-08-15T16:46:49Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Erin Hopkins","image":null}},{"id":107210,"name":"Marina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Marina was born in 1987 and comes from the big village of Petrovo.

Justine is 21 years old and lives in the town of Kyotera in the Masaka area of Uganda.  She is married and has one child.  Justine has a business running a small restaurant in Kyotera.  Justine has had her business for approximately three years.\r\n\r\nTo expand her business, Justine is requesting a loan of 200,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda.  The loan will be used to buy more food stocks to use in her restaurant, and also to invest in the restaurant\u2019s upkeep.  Justine hopes to bring more clients to her restaurant, and generate greater profits for her family.  \r\n\r\nNote to lenders: BRAC Uganda has recently begun posting a new loan product to Kiva which funds young entrepreneurs in BRAC\u2019s Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program.  This Kiva borrower is receiving a new ELA loan. The ELA program first provides disadvantaged adolescents, usually girls who are out of school, with livelihood training and financial literacy skills.  Afterwards, ELA participants can receive microfinance loans to expand their small businesses.  These loans offer adolescents a unique chance to access finance at a young age and improve their prospects for the future, and target a segment of the population not typically served by traditional microfinance.  Kiva is privileged to partner with BRAC Uganda in posting these new loans, and give Kiva lenders the opportunity to fund deserving young entrepreneurs and support a promising new sector in microfinance."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":100,"image":{"id":559260,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Restaurant","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Food

He lives in his own home with his wife Eva and he tries to work as hard as he can to improve their quality of life.  In the Miraflores community (in the district of La Merced) Leoncio runs his business out of his home; he sells chickens, ducks and geese.  He does his best to keep them well-fed and well taken care of so he can sell them more quickly.  He feels content with the money her earns through his business and would like to work harder to do even better in this line of work.  His favorite part of his job is feeding the birds as he feeds them a great amount of love; nonetheless, it takes a lot of time to take care of them.  In the future, he plans to rent a storefront where he can offer better attend to his customers.  This is his 3rd loan through MFP; he knows that he must make his payments punctually and he is willing to do so.  In his village bank, he is a very happy and responsible member.

She sells health products, a business she started out in 2010 with the help of a loan granted to her by a promoter of these products. She completes her sales on credit, with two bi-weekly payments. Her first clients were her friends and family but gradually her clients have increased for the referrals that have been made. Her goal in the future is to have a specialized store featuring these products, operating from her own home. But she faces a great challenge and that is insufficient capital funds to achieve her goal. This is the reason why she requests a Kiva loan. It is the first loan she accesses through Fundacion Mario Santo Domingo (Kiva Field Partner) and it will help her stimulate growth. With this loan she will purchase health products, including biotherapies, and natural and aromatherapy treatments for hair, body, and feet. These products are very well accepted by her clientele, especially having observed benefits from their experience. As Diana works and expends her efforts she strives to achieve her dream of expanding her business.
