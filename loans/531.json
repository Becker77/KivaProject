He earns about 3,500 meticais, with about 3,000 more coming from his business.  He uses the money to cover household expenses and also manages to save some in his bank account.\r\n\r\nErnesto has never taken out loans from other banks.  He learned about Hluvuku through friends who are also customers of this institution.  This is his first loan.

In her business she sells a bit of everything, according to what her customers ask her for.  She has 14 years experience and her first steps in this business were selling a few products to her very close friends.  In 2009 she started selling formally, taking advantage of the increase in her market, owing to the large number of referrals that now form part of her customer base.\r\n\r\nBenilda's success is due to the quality of the products that she sells and the payment terms that she offers her customers.  Added to this is the kind service that she provides which enables her to keep her customers and also turns them into keen spokespeople for her business.  Another of her strengths is that her business is located on a very busy corner.  She also maintains good relations with her 4 suppliers from whom she buys her products through specialized catalogs.  However, she also sells merchandise that the catalogs don't have which she knows her customers like to buy.\r\n\r\nBenilda's goal for the future is to continue taking advantage of her location in order to start selling 'bolis' (frozen drinks maD. from natural fruits), ice creams and soft drinks.  This Kiva loan is her first from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo and she will use it to buy perfumes, lipsticks, deodorants, exercise books, pencils, pencil sharpeners and other products wholesale.  This investment is very likely to be successful because it is based on orders, with appropriate repayment terms, from her permanent customers."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":736816,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy perfumes, lipsticks, deodorants, exercise books, pencils, pencil sharpeners and other products wholesale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2011-03-24T15:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":575,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Benilda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-03-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1070000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":73318},{"due_date":"2011-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":81559},{"due_date":"2011-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":83122},{"due_date":"2011-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":84715},{"due_date":"2011-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":86339},{"due_date":"2011-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":87994},{"due_date":"2011-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":89680},{"due_date":"2011-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":91399},{"due_date":"2012-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":93151},{"due_date":"2012-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":94936},{"due_date":"2012-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":96756},{"due_date":"2012-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":107031}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.4},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.83},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.67},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.52},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.4},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.28},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.2},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.11},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.06},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.02},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.99},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.52}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":39.4,"local_amount":73318,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:17:54Z","rounded_local_amount":73756.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211230510},{"amount":88.5,"local_amount":164681,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:08:54Z","rounded_local_amount":165666.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216509361},{"amount":45.52,"local_amount":84715,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:50:32Z","rounded_local_amount":85221.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221673584},{"amount":46.4,"local_amount":86339,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-17T08:00:59Z","rounded_local_amount":86855.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227320140},{"amount":47.29,"local_amount":87994,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:05:38Z","rounded_local_amount":88520.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232803277},{"amount":48.19,"local_amount":89680,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:17:26Z","rounded_local_amount":90216.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238614360},{"amount":49.12,"local_amount":91399,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-21T08:54:00Z","rounded_local_amount":91945.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244568329},{"amount":101.07,"local_amount":188087,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T10:21:51Z","rounded_local_amount":189212.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257188091},{"amount":109.51,"local_amount":203787,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T09:30:58Z","rounded_local_amount":205005.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270038402}],"funded_date":"2011-03-27T09:02:42Z","paid_date":"2012-04-15T09:30:58Z","journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Oxnard","image":null}},{"id":288751,"name":"Crucero De San Vicente 1 Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Este grupo se llama Crucero D.

She is 39 years old, married and has three daughters.  She lives in the 25 de Febrero neighborhood.  Her husband works in transportation in the city of Tegucigalpa and her children are in school.  Tesla started her business in 2002 by selling milk popsicles, charamusca (flavored ice in a bag), and frozen chocolate-covered bananas.  She saw that she did well over time, so she decided to set up a store in her house a year later to sell basic food items and she requested her first loan with FAMA.  Tesla would love to be able to expand her small place of business, as well as stock it with a variety of products.

Es una peque\u00f1a comunidad rural de aproximadamente dos mil habitantes. Sus pobladores se dedican a la producci\u00f3n de leche y la agricultura. Tiene un relieve irregular y mucho del terreno se mantiene como bosque tropical h\u00famedo.

Sin embargo, varias veces al a\u00f1o el camino se vuelve intransitable por las lluvias.\n\nDesde hace varios a\u00f1os que Cristhian ha querido mejorar su lecher\u00eda, el cuenta en estos momentos con el local para llevar a cabo su actividad, pero le falta lo principal para que su negocio surja, su prop\u00f3sito es vender sus productos a los vecinos de su comunidad.

This is a small rural community of approximately two thousand inhabitants. Its people work in milk production and agriculture. The terrain is irregular and much of it is tropical, humid woods. Cimarron is located approximately an hour and a half by bus from Turrialba, the closest shopping center. Of course, at various times throughout the year the road becomes impassable due to the rain.\r\n\r\nFor several years Cristhian has wanted to improve his dairy.

Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain under served by financial institutions.

She thanks you for your support. <P>Raising kuku is a popular micro-business in Tanzania, especially amongst SELFINA clients. In fact, if you are a regular lender on kiva.org, you may be tired of reading about kuku, which is Swahili for 'chickens.'  Raising them for sale is popular for a number of reasons. Firstly, they require little start-up capital. You can start with one or two, and either add to them as you go, or wait for them to multiple naturally! Secondly, they require little space, so sometimes you can just let them run around in your garden or compound. Thirdly, while they are growing they produce eggs, which can either be sold to provide a supplementary source of income, or eaten to provide a supplementary source of protein. I\u2019m sure there are hundreds of other reasons that raising kuku is so popular (maybe they are friendlier than other animals? Prettier?), but this is all time and space will allow."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":164383,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To purchase additional chicks, feed, and antibiotics.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbeya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.9 33.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-05-26T13:40:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rachel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-06-10T07:16:35Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2008-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2008-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2008-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2008-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2008-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-03-10T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":43,"local_amount":50588.24,"processed_date":"2008-07-10T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:38:43Z","rounded_local_amount":50783,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263343},{"amount":43,"local_amount":50588.24,"processed_date":"2008-08-10T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:42:27Z","rounded_local_amount":50783,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":292256},{"amount":43,"local_amount":50588.24,"processed_date":"2008-09-10T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-09-22T07:13:58Z","rounded_local_amount":50783,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322710},{"amount":43,"local_amount":50588.24,"processed_date":"2008-10-10T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-19T07:19:54Z","rounded_local_amount":50783,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355059},{"amount":40.5,"local_amount":47647.04,"processed_date":"2008-11-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T03:23:57Z","rounded_local_amount":47830.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5347665},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2008-12-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:08:39Z","rounded_local_amount":50192.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9970280},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-01-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:12:57Z","rounded_local_amount":50192.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14886530},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-02-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:02:09Z","rounded_local_amount":50192.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20435815},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-03-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:54:40Z","rounded_local_amount":50192.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130120},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-04-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:23:01Z","rounded_local_amount":50192.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36026953}],"funded_date":"2008-05-27T07:16:35Z","paid_date":"2009-05-15T23:23:01Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":54363,"name":"Yanixia Mar\u00eda","description":{"languages":["es"],"texts":{"es":"Ms. Yanixia S. is from Chinandega.

She is 47 years old, married and the mother of three children.  Her schooling was cut short and she only completed four years of elementary school.  She has worked with the Manuela Ramos movement for three years.  She operates a business buying and selling cheese and selling grains at markets in Pilcuyo, Acora and Tacna.  Her first loan was for S\/.300 [300 Peruvian soles], a sum she used to sell her products at the El Altipano market in Tacna.  This S\/.3000 loan will be used to buy cattle which she will fatten and cheese that she will take to the markets in Tacna and Arequipa.

Virgilia has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional inventory and to provide working capital. Virgilia is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This loan will be the ninth loan taken out by Virgilia from PMPC.

While this is not the only means of generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from buying and selling electronic loads (electronic transfer of airtime using text messaging) from several networks like SMART and GLOBE in the local community. Claudia has been engaged in her business for over 1 year and earns approximately 10000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Claudia joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Claudia has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to to invest in expanding the business. Claudia is requesting a new loan of 10000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional electronic loads to buy and sell. This loan will be the 7th loan taken out by Claudia from HSPFI.

Here we will provide details of their different business activities:\r\n\r\nSantos Cristina L\u00f3pez R. sells products.  She has a grocery store and a bicycle parts business.  She has several years experience in running this type of business which means that she has a very good customer base.  In her business, you can find a little bit of everything, both food products and, at the same time, a variety of bicycle parts.  This mode of transport is very popular in her area since it enables people to get to work and school and is also used for recreational purposes.\r\n\r\nCristina's business has been experiencing significant growth.  She now has electricity and can sell products that require refrigeration such as cold cuts, soft drinks popsicles and dairy products.\r\n\r\nCristina will use her loan to buy merchandise so that she can better stock her business and have a little bit of everything available so that she can meet her customer demand.\r\n\r\nNohem\u00ed del Carmen R. sells products.  She sells American clothes.  She has been in this business for four months.  Before this she used to have a small grocery store which she had to abandon.  Once they installed electricity in the area, the bigger businesses bought refrigeration equipment and she didn't have enough capital to invest in her business.  This meant that her business declined.  For this reason, she decided to start another business activity in order to make money.  She set up her new business selling American clothes.  She goes out to sell to her neighbors and in neighboring areas.  She makes her sales both for cash and on credit.  She uses the income from this business to cover her personal expenses and her household expenses.\r\n\r\nNohem\u00ed will use her loan to buy a bundle of American summer clothes so that she can satisfy her customers.\r\n\r\nSantos Juli\u00e1n L\u00f3pez R. is a small farmer.  He grows basic grains.  As a river passes nearby the community where he lives, he takes maximum advantage in order to irrigate a small plot of land which measures half a 'manzana' (note: one 'manzana' = 1.68 acres).  This business has risen in his area since the climatic conditions lend themselves to growing basic grains.  Santos sells to buyers who come from El Salvador.  They pay a good price for his produce.  He also sells to buyers from his area who supply the local market.\r\n\r\nSantos will use his loan to buy supplies and fertilizers so that he can improve his crops."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":756127,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy bicycle parts, butter, oil, margarine, beans, rice, sugar, coffee, bread, soft drinks, juices, corn flour, salt, condiments, eggs, used clothes, basic grains to grow and fertilizers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"Danli","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"14.033333 -86.583333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":118,"posted_date":"2011-04-26T11:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":750,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nohemi Del Carmen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Santos Julian ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Santos Cristina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-04-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":14000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1750},{"due_date":"2011-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1750},{"due_date":"2011-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1750},{"due_date":"2011-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1750},{"due_date":"2011-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1750},{"due_date":"2011-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1750},{"due_date":"2011-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":1750},{"due_date":"2011-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":1750}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.75},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.75},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.75},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.75},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.75},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":93.75},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":93.75},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":93.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":113.84,"local_amount":2125,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:56:18Z","rounded_local_amount":2150.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211295807},{"amount":113.84,"local_amount":2125,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:49:26Z","rounded_local_amount":2150.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216575714},{"amount":113.84,"local_amount":2125,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T09:26:24Z","rounded_local_amount":2150.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221745428},{"amount":113.84,"local_amount":2125,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-20T08:10:00Z","rounded_local_amount":2150.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227718426},{"amount":113.84,"local_amount":2125,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T10:08:43Z","rounded_local_amount":2150.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232876669},{"amount":113.84,"local_amount":2125,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T11:19:24Z","rounded_local_amount":2150.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238693355},{"amount":66.96,"local_amount":1250,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T11:06:42Z","rounded_local_amount":1265.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244649354}],"funded_date":"2011-04-26T19:55:19Z","paid_date":"2011-12-15T11:06:42Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Oxnard","image":null}},{"id":296961,"name":"Ntungamo Kwetungura Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"M.

He lives in the village of Yanama.  There he started his family, together with Lourdes, his wife of three years.  They have 2 children that they love very much and care for in their own home.  Percy's mornings are very arduous, since he devotes himself to many activities during the day.  His greatest inspiration is his children, to whom he wants to give a better quality of life. That is why he works hard on his farmland, where he plants peas, potatoes, and gladiolus flowers. He already has 10 years of experience in farming.  During all that time, he has been able to get a good market in the city of Tarma and in the country's capital. Depending on the demand for the product, he will travel to the place of greatest advantage to him.  As an example, in July he goes to the \"La Parada\" market located in Peru's capital, where he sells the food he produces at a good price.  He also has 2 bulls, with which he plows the land of various farmers, earning 80 soles a day in this way.  But he only provides this service during harvest time, so he would like to take greater advantage of that season.  And soon he will be able to do it, since he will buy another bull to help him with the plowing.  He also has sheep, from which he hopes to earn some extra money when he sells them.  He belongs to the \"Manantiales de Yanama\" communal bank, and this is his fifth loan with MFP.  He hopes for the support of all of you to continue with his goals. He is also thankful for the confidence placed in him.  Percy, once he obtains this support, will use the money he is asking for to purchase 3 bags of pea seed to successfully begin his next harvest."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":823747,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase 3 bags of pea seeds","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-07-27T01:50:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":750,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Percy ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-07-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":750}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":750,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:31:51Z","rounded_local_amount":2052,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263385435}],"funded_date":"2011-07-27T05:44:58Z","paid_date":"2012-03-15T10:31:51Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Karen Ohrenberger","image":null}},{"id":325651,"name":"Segundo Isidoro","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Segundo de 62 a\u00f1os de edad, vive con su familia en su casa propia, cuenta con todos los servicios b\u00e1sicos, ubicada en la zona urbana del distrito de Jos\u00e9 Leonardo Ortiz que pertenece a la provincia de Chiclayo.

In general they generate sufficient income to cover their daily expenses, but now they wish to invest in order to provide an additional variety of products, to expand their businesses, generate increased income, and improve their quality of life.<p><p>\r\n<p><b>Translated from Spanish by Susan Sanford, Kiva volunteer<p><\/b>\r\n\r\nLa asociaci\u00f3n 24 de enero de Panamericana esta formada por 12 miembros activos que trabajan junto a la  familia de Pro-Mujer en el centro focal de Panamericana de la ciudad de El Alto. \r\nMuy temprano comienza el d\u00eda para la asociaci\u00f3n 24 de Enero, ya que  se dedican a la venta de verduras y fruta en la feria de la Ceja  de El Alto, adquieren productos de mayoristas, para luego vender \u00e9stos al por menor por lo general ellas generan ingresos suficientes para sus gastos diarios , pero ahora quieren invertir para proveerse de otra variedad de productos para ampliar sus negocios y asi les  permita generar mayores ingresos y mejorar su calidad de vida."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3500,"image":{"id":185978,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Capital for purchasing products","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"El Alto \/ La Paz","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.483333 -68.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":59,"posted_date":"2008-08-21T17:10:14Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":3500,"lender_count":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Clotilde","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Aquilina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Esperanza","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eva","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jeanneth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Leticia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elsa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Monica","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fabiola","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Carminia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-09-13T15:40:34Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":24545.44,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":3500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":4090.91},{"due_date":"2008-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":4090.91},{"due_date":"2008-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":4090.91},{"due_date":"2009-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":4090.91},{"due_date":"2009-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":4090.91},{"due_date":"2009-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":4090.89}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":583.33},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":583.33},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":583.33},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":583.33},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":583.33},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":583.35}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":584,"local_amount":4095.58,"processed_date":"2008-10-13T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-14T07:10:59Z","rounded_local_amount":4121.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":358222},{"amount":582.67,"local_amount":4086.24,"processed_date":"2008-11-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-07T08:07:32Z","rounded_local_amount":4112.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5345423},{"amount":583.33,"local_amount":4090.91,"processed_date":"2008-12-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-19T09:15:10Z","rounded_local_amount":4116.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9967960},{"amount":583.33,"local_amount":4090.91,"processed_date":"2009-01-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:02:01Z","rounded_local_amount":4116.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14884376},{"amount":583.33,"local_amount":4090.91,"processed_date":"2009-02-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-18T08:08:08Z","rounded_local_amount":4116.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20433824},{"amount":583.34,"local_amount":4090.89,"processed_date":"2009-03-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-17T08:05:37Z","rounded_local_amount":4116.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27128218}],"funded_date":"2008-08-30T15:40:34Z","paid_date":"2009-04-17T08:05:37Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":62572,"name":"Mwanjab's Tuwe Pamoja Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mwanjab  is 28  years old.

She is 57 and divorced; her son and daughter are adults. They work and live separately from her. Usually women of her age are already retired and do not work, they depend on their children. However, Anara is not like that - all her life she depended only on herself and got used to it. Now, she earns her living by selling milk from her cows. Sometimes, her children come from the city to help her around the house. Six years ago, her relatives advised her to buy a cow. Now, keeping this cow lets her live an independent humble life. Now she courageously seeks a loan to help her two grandchildren pay for their college education. After having some experience with keeping cows, she seriously got interested in raising cattle. Her ultimate dream is to buy a big house outside the capital to be near her children, so that her grandchildren could visit her more often.\r\n\r\nAnara\u2019s partners in the group are Lyubov, Ainakan, Nazgul and Jiparkul. Lyubov is 51. She and her husband work at school. All their children live separately. Two sons are in Russia, while other two sons work as drivers, and their daughter works at school. Lyubov needs a loan to buy a new fridge. \r\n\r\nAinakan is divorced; she raised three children. She works as a tailor, receiving orders for manufactured or ready-made garments. She then distributes products to clothing stores. This was her friend\u2019s suggestion. Now she feels ready to try cattle-raising and therefore needs a loan to buy a calf.\r\n\r\nNazgul is a mother of four children. She makes a living by selling hay and milk. What she earns is not sufficient, so she wants to obtain a loan to send her daughter to work in Russia, so that her daughter can help her mother financially.   \r\n\r\nJipargul is 50. She is divorced and has one daughter. She makes a living by selling hay. Jipargul needs a loan to prepare her daughter\u2019s dowry.  \r\n\r\n\r\n======================================\r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance, a young and ambitious socially-focused MFI in Kyrgyzstan.\r\n\r\nMol Bulak Finance is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development on the basis of 3-Ps concept - People (building human capital and taking care of its customers and the society as well), Profit (to be profitable to grow further) and the Planet (taking care of the environment).

This area is known for its handicrafts (the best straw hats in the world), traditional dishes, natural beauty, and friendly people.\r\n<p>\r\nThis Communal Bank consists of enterprising women who are looking to provide their families with a better quality of life.  One of these women is Lorena Elizabeth D. S., a single mother of two children.  She divides her time among her household chores, looking after children, and her work as a retailer.  Lorena buys and sells merchandise such as dress clothes, casual wear, sportswear, and undergarments for women, men, and children.  In addition, she offers Yanbal cosmetics.  She sells her products as a traveling merchant in the neighborhood where she lives.  To keep her customers happy, she allows them to pay her on a weekly or biweekly schedule.   \r\n<p>\r\nLorena is preparing to become a professional.  She started her studies at the University of Manta for a degree in Management Services.  When she has to work or study, Lorena\u2019s mother looks after her children since they already live together.  Lorena says living with two small children is not easy, but they provide the inspiration for her to go to work every day.  \r\n<p>\r\nLorena is requesting another loan from Fundaci\u00f3n ESPOIR.  She worked on three previous loan cycles and used the proceeds to invest in her business.  With this loan, she plans to buy merchandise to add to her inventory such as jeans, shirts, blouses, underwear, and other items for women, men, and children.  This will allow her to be prepared for the Christmas season and fulfill some of her outstanding customer orders.  \r\n<p>\r\nShe dreams of opening a large clothing store so that she can continue supporting her children and cover her educational expenses.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":424866,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"Purchase additional merchandise for the Christmas season","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Portoviejo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2009-11-17T07:30:12Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":" Lorena Elizabeth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-10-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":330,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":41.25},{"due_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":41.25},{"due_date":"2009-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":41.25},{"due_date":"2009-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":41.25},{"due_date":"2010-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":41.25},{"due_date":"2010-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":41.25},{"due_date":"2010-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":41.25},{"due_date":"2010-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":41.25}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":43.75,"local_amount":41.25,"processed_date":"2009-11-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T12:30:01Z","rounded_local_amount":43.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103789459},{"amount":43.75,"local_amount":41.25,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T12:30:58Z","rounded_local_amount":43.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103789460},{"amount":43.75,"local_amount":41.25,"processed_date":"2009-12-14T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T13:28:18Z","rounded_local_amount":43.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110679932},{"amount":43.75,"local_amount":41.25,"processed_date":"2009-12-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T13:29:07Z","rounded_local_amount":43.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110679933},{"amount":43.75,"local_amount":41.25,"processed_date":"2010-01-11T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:33:29Z","rounded_local_amount":43.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118074479},{"amount":43.75,"local_amount":41.25,"processed_date":"2010-01-25T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:33:43Z","rounded_local_amount":43.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118074480},{"amount":43.75,"local_amount":41.25,"processed_date":"2010-02-08T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:07:19Z","rounded_local_amount":43.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123910478},{"amount":43.75,"local_amount":41.25,"processed_date":"2010-02-17T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:07:27Z","rounded_local_amount":43.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123910479}],"funded_date":"2009-11-17T10:55:21Z","paid_date":"2010-03-15T10:07:27Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ronan Reodica","image":498323}},{"id":156999,"name":"Ramon","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"When Ramon was laid off from his job in 2005, he decided to become a taxi driver in order to earn enough income to support his family. He has successfully made a steady income since then, but he says one of the main challenges of being a taxi driver is keeping his vehicle in good shape. Since he drives it all day, it is constantly breaking down. Now, he is going to use his loan from ACCION USA to pay for repairs to his car. He is a return client, but has also used credit cards to pay for repairs in the past. With credit cards, he tries to pay his full balance at the end of the month because of the high interest charges.\r\n<p>\r\nRamon does not want to be a taxi driver forever - he has big dreams to open his own business one day, in an entirely different industry  - a restaurant! He hopes that when he decides to do this and has saved enough money, he will be able to get help from ACCION USA to start up the business.\r\n<p>\t\t\t\r\nMore about ACCION USA and the underbanked in the United States\r\n<p>\r\nHave you ever thought about how the cute new caf\u00e9 on your corner or the salon you frequent on a monthly basis got the financial resources to start their business? Chances are, they drummed up support from their friends and family, dipped into their personal savings, used a high-interest credit card, or all of the above. An estimated 10 million small businesses in the U.S. face difficulty obtaining loans from traditional banks, even prior to the current  \u201ccredit crisis.\u201d Microfinance institutions like ACCION USA, support these \u201cunbanked\u201d small businesses by giving them access to fairly-priced capital and business education. \r\n\r\nSmall businesses also help stabilize low-income neighborhoods and rebuild the U.S. economy through income growth and job creation. Self-employment provides low to moderate income workers with a way to increase their incomes, support their families, and strengthen their communities. As unemployment rises in the U.S., more and more people are turning to self-employment and start-up enterprises as a way to take control of their economic futures and provide employment opportunities in their communities. The need for support of small businesses in the U.S. is great, and it is one that ACCION USA has been striving to meet since 1991."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":6400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":6400,"image":{"id":434260,"template_id":1},"video":{"id":1452,"youtubeId":"aglweCglLDY","title":"Kiva Entrepreneur

The group is made up of 20 very hard-working, humble women who work every day to earn a living.\n The loan the group took out from Fundaci\u00f3n Paraguaya was disbursed among them, and each member invested the money in their respective business. \n One of the group members is Gloria, who sews high-fashion wedding dresses and evening gowns. Her work is impeccable and very valuable. She does very lovely embroidery and designs, so she has many clients. She used her loan to buy the materials she needs, like colored thread, beads for embroidery, and fabric. \nEach one of the group members works at their respective job to support their family:\n1.

Occidental. She earns her living by operating 3 business ventures:   swine raising, rental of a water pump, and farming businesses.  Her husband Jose M., who is 58 years old, works as a farmer to earn his living.  They have  5 children who are 18 to  28 years old. \r\n\r\nLucia joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2007 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 6 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Lucia has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 13,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 10,000, thus, uplifting the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 6th loan, she is borrowing PHP 15,000 which she intends to use as additional working capital so that she can continue to save up for their future and purchase a motorcycle. Lucia M. is a 'Dungganon' woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed on a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She lives together with her husband, Luis, and her 3 children whom she loves very much. They live in harmony in their own home in the village of Patay. She is very happy. Every morning from very early she goes to work with her husband Luis, managing her crops of potatoes, ulluco, peas, and broad beans. They plant them on their own land which she and her husband were able to acquire thanks to their hard work together as partners and spouses. \r\n\r\nThey have been farming for 11 years and what they like most is being able to spend most of their time together as a family. For the development and success of their business, in the future they want to save enough money to be able to buy a truck so that they can reduce the cost of transportation to the wholesale market in the city where they sell their harvest. It would also help with their business buying and selling animals, which consists of carrying bulls, cows, donkeys and rams to the cattle market in the city of Huancayo. There they sell each specimen for a good price. \r\n\r\nShe belongs to the village bank \"Picaflores de Patay\" and this is her 5th loan with MFP where she is a hardworking member and is very punctual in her payments. For this reason she hopes for all of your support in obtaining this small loan. Angelica will invest the requested loan in the purchase of bulls and cows.

She has 2 years of experience in this business. She needs a loan of 1,500 WST to purchase weed-killers, such as Gramoxome. She plans to use the profit from her business (estimated to be 400 WST or US $167 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Oleala joined SPBD to gain access to financial services. Most of SPBD's clients are unable to borrow from commercial banks because they lack collateral. This is Oleala's second loan with SPBD. \r\n\r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD:\r\n\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem. Please join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD.\r\n\r\nSPBD evaluates the living conditions of each of its borrowers.  Generally, a loan manager evaluates a variety of social metrics on a scale out of 3 (the higher the number, the better off the person is) and these are averaged for the \"overall social metric score\".  For example, a 3 out of 3 on \"level of education\" would mean that the borrower has graduated from university.

He added everything he learned to the education his parents instilled in him since he was a child.  He stopped practicing his professional career of nursing because the low wages that he received didn't let him support his three sons.  Now he is dedicated to raising and fattening his cattle.  He rents and sells the breed that he raises at his farm for bullfighting activities in the various towns in the Mantaro Valley.  In accordance with upcoming celebrations, Santiago presently has 12 cattle that he is raising for these activities.  He plans to keep raising livestock and to acquire even more.  Subsequently, he plans to open a small pharmacy in the city where he can practice his profession independently.

She currently lives with her husband in the Bayanzurh district of Ulaanbaatar, the capital city of Mongolia. All of her children have grown up and live with their own families now.  Dariimaa has a small retail business, selling various small food items such as chewing gum, soft-drinks, cigars, and so on. \r\n<p>\r\nIn 2000, her family moved from Khovd, one of the most isolated western provinces in Mongolia, to the capital city in search of a better life. In 2001, she started her small retail business in the Narantuul market, the largest outdoor market in Ulaanbaatar.

Her husband Mateo G., 58 years old, helps in his wife's business activities.  They have 8 children who are 23 to  34 years old. \r\n\r\nFlorentina joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1999 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 15 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Florentina has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 10,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 6000,  uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 16th loan, she is borrowing PHP 12,000, which she intends to use as additional working capital so that she can continue to save up for the future of her business and family. The accompanying photo of Florentina and her husband in their wooden boat was taken near the raft where they raise oysters. Florentina G. is a 'Dungganon' woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.\r\n\r\n About NWTF:\r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams.

With the help of her past 16 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Sergia has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 12,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 9,900 uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 17th loan, she is borrowing PHP 12,000 as additional capital so that she can continue to save up for future family needs and expansion of her businesses. Sergia is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She has many years of experience in this business.    Sasauli needs a loan of WST 1,500 to purchase harvesting equipment such as wheelbarrows, shovels, rakes, baskets and knives. She plans to use the profit from her business (estimated to be 600 WST or US $250 per week) to improve and expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Sasauli joined SPBD to gain access to financial services. Most of SPBD's clients are unable to borrow from commercial banks because they lack collateral. This is Sasauli's second loan with SPBD. \r\n\r\n*SPBD evaluates the living conditions of each of its borrowers. Generally, a loan manager evaluates a variety of social metrics on a scale out of 3 (The higher the number, the better off the person is.) and these are averaged for the overall social metric score.  For example, a 3 out of 3 on \"level of education\" would mean that the borrower has graduated from university.  \r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

For the last 8 years, she has been preparing and selling food. Some of the most popular are chicken and rice, noodles, fried rice and potatoes with Ocopa sauce (Peruvian dishes). These are what most of her customers like. Among them are athletes who play on the community sports fields, but on weekdays she sells mazamorra morada and rice pudding (Peruvian desserts).  What she likes the most about her work is that it is a calm activity and she does it with no rush and it is profitable. With this job, she can watch her grandson.

The group is comprised of Mr. Jos\u00e9 Socorro, who will use this loan to buy food for raising <i>mojarra<\/i> [a type of fish]; Ms. Mar\u00eda Fidela, who will buy pigs, sheep and bulls; Ms. Felipa and Ms. Mar\u00eda de la Luz, who will buy soap, sugar, milk and eggs; Ms. Patricia who will buy food for fattening her sheep; Ms. Mar\u00eda Mercedes who will buy pigs to fatten; and Ms. Virginia, who is going to buy vegetables and meat to make her tacos.\r\n\r\nVirgina is 51 years old and studied until the second year of primary school. She is married and has seven children, five of whom are grown up and working. Her two younger children are a 15 year-old boy who is in secondary school and a 9 year-old girl who attends primary school. Virginia sells steak, sausage and tripe tacos. She is requesting a loan to buy one burner, soft drinks, and vegetables and meat to prepare her tacos. She will also use part to install a floor where she sells her tacos.\r\n\r\nVirginia started her business 25 years ago because, with her husband out of work and her children still young, she lacked the necessary economic resources. She obtained a loan with her brother-in-law to put into her business and started to sell her tacos. Her business is important because it brings in profits when she's selling well. Virginia remembers once when her granddaughter was sick and she came up with 500 pesos to bring her to the doctor and to pay for her medicines. It was the profits from her business that made it possible for Virginia to pay.\r\n\r\nShe feels proud that the families who are her customers prefer her business and is proud when they say that her tacos are delicious. She reinvests her profits to buy ingredients to continue selling. Her daughter and her husband help her with the business, preparing and selling the tacos. Virginia's hopes and dreams are to make her business larger and for her youngest children to reach professional careers. She is happy to receive this loan because it's not just anywhere that you find people who help others unselfishly.\r\n\r\nThe members of this group would like to tell Kiva and Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad: \"Thank you very much for having confidence in us. We will not fail you, so that you will continue helping more people with their businesses and families.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Jos\u00e9 Socorro is missing in the photograph above."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1450,"image":{"id":840329,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy a burner, soft drinks, and vegetables and meat for preparing tacos","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2011-08-16T16:40:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1450,"lender_count":57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jose Socorro","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Fidela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Felipa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Patricia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Mercedes ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria De La Luz ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Virginia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":18000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":1450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":2250},{"due_date":"2011-08-29T07:00:00Z","amount":2250},{"due_date":"2011-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":2250},{"due_date":"2011-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":2250},{"due_date":"2011-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":2250},{"due_date":"2011-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":2250},{"due_date":"2011-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":2250},{"due_date":"2011-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":2250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":181.25},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":181.25},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":181.25},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":181.25},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":181.25},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":181.25},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":181.25},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":181.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":362.5,"local_amount":4500,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-16T08:11:14Z","rounded_local_amount":4505.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227201970},{"amount":362.5,"local_amount":4500,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:12:10Z","rounded_local_amount":4505.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232807562},{"amount":362.5,"local_amount":4500,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:22:39Z","rounded_local_amount":4505.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238618656},{"amount":362.5,"local_amount":4500,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:04:35Z","rounded_local_amount":4505.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244572898}],"funded_date":"2011-08-17T10:19:44Z","paid_date":"2011-12-15T10:04:35Z","journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Katie Kavanagh","image":847206}},{"id":329800,"name":"Banco Comunal Tesoro De Dios Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Este Banco Comunal Tesoro De Dios est\u00e1 conformado por nueve integrantes que se dedican a diferentes actividades econ\u00f3micas, ellos formaron este grupo La representante es la se\u00f1ora Azucena De La Concepci\u00f3n de 63 a\u00f1os tiene 13 hijos que viven de manera independiente.

They named their group Cookery Women. This will be their fourth loan from SMT. Previous loans have made tremendous impacts in their lives. The last loan they received from Kiva through SMT was for Le 800,000.00 each. Now, they are requesting a loan of Le 1,000,000.00 for each to enable them to strengthen their businesses further.\n\nIsatu S. (2nd from left) is the leader of this group. Isatu is forty years of age. She was born in Kupr Kalisa, Kambia district, in the northern part of Sierra Leone. She now resides in Makeni City together with her husband. She has two children. One is in Senior Secondary School II (JSS II) and the other is in Class 2.  Her husband is a businessman. \n\nIsatu sells cooked rice and has been in this business for over eight years now. With this loan, Isatu will buy cooking ingredients.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to com,munities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New Western culture and Central Asian traditions. But Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

M. is a 46-year-old woman living in the town of Vaiusu T. She is married and has 6 adult-aged children. To make a living, Naite owns and operates a handicraft business. She sells fabric handicrafts to tourists and local community members. Naite has been engaged in this business for over 3 years.\r\n\r\nNaite joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. This will be Naite's 4th loan from SPBD. She most recently repaid a loan of 2250 WST that she used to purchase raw materials to make additional handicrafts. She will use this loan of 2750 WST to purchase more raw materials and expand her business.\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\n<br>\r\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.\r\n\r\nNote\r\n<br>\r\nTo maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva

They live in Salvadorita County in Puerto Principe, in the jurisdiction of Nueva Guinea. For 35 years, Wilfredo's main occupation has been farming and ranching. He is requesting his second loan with AFODENIC and hopes to receive benefits from the Kiva fund so that he can purchase two cows which have given birth. This will allow him to produce milk on his farm, sell dairy products, and improve his dairy herd, thus ensuring that his family unit will have sufficient food and income. Wilfredo's ranch offers good technical conditions for the development of this herd. In his community, Wilfredo is highly respected for his leadership. In the future, he hopes to improve the quality of life for his family and increase his inventory of livestock. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Patricia Linderman, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":491885,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Purchasing milk cows","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Nueva Guinea, RAAS","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 -85","type":"point"}},"partner_id":98,"posted_date":"2010-02-20T04:00:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1200,"lender_count":46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Wilfredo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-02-18T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":25000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":1200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":25000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1200}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":1200,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T08:11:37Z","rounded_local_amount":25170,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263227579}],"funded_date":"2010-02-28T12:57:41Z","paid_date":"2012-03-15T08:11:37Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Patricia Linderman","image":100107}},{"id":182219,"name":"Anecita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Anecita is hopeful that, by starting a small business, she will be able to make a profit, which she can use to support some of her family's needs.
