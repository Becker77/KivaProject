Mabinuligon, Brgy. Maquiling, Sagay City, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating two business ventures: a general store and standing cane businesses.  Her husband Crispin, who is 74 years old, works as a farmer to earn his living and he also helps his wife.  They have seven children who are 28 to 50 years old. \r\n\r\nAmparo joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1997 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 15 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Amparo has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 17,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 6,000.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 16th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 19,000 to buy standing cane and stocks for her general store so that she could continue to save up for future home repairs and to expand her standing cane business.  Amparo is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\n---------------------------------------\r\nAbout NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest

She earns her living by operating 2 business ventures - a pig fattening business and a fish vending business. Her husband Allan, who is 37 years old, works as a tricycle driver to earn his living, and also helps in his wife's business activities. They have 4 children who are 5 to 12 years old. <p>\r\n\r\nNimpha  joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2000 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 17 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Nimpha has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 19000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 9000, uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her 18th loan cycle, she is borrowing PHP 19500, which she intends to use to as additional working capital  for her business ventures so that she could continue to save up for future education of her children and support the family's household expenses. Nimpha is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. <p>\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She also claims that she has not experienced any losses because whenever the price of peas is low at the market, she will dry her harvest and sells her products as seeds.  As a result, she earns slightly more that what she invested.  Each bag of seed sells for at least 500 PEN.  Her main difficulty has been not having her own land so that she can cover the educational expenses of her children.

Many FPW borrowers have recently expressed a desire to borrow larger amounts to make more significant investments in their businesses.

community (called a batey) of Peligro, which lies in the countryside outside of El Seybo, Dominican Republic. She is the group coordinator for the Bank of Hope called Mujeres Unidas de Peligro (United Women of Peligro), Group 2. Altagracia's story is illustrative of the experiences of her fellow borrowers in Mujeres Unidas de Peligro. \r\n\r\nToday, Altagracia is taking out her seventh loan with Kiva and Esperanza International in order to buy more food products, such as beef, pork, juice, and other provisions, to sell in the small grocery store she runs out of her home. Altagracia has been managing her store for 8 years, and she reports that business has grown significantly since she became a client of Kiva and Esperanza three and a half years ago. With small loans from Kiva and Esperanza, Altagracia has been able to purchase new appliances, such as a food processor and a juicer, to expand her store's offerings and increase sales. Today, Altagracia can afford to borrow almost three times the amount of her very first Kiva loan. She also says that, although she had some savings before, with Kiva loans she can now mobilize her savings more effectively to support the needs of herself and her family. \r\n\r\nAltagracia lives with her four children (ages 9, 8, 6, and 4) and her husband. Altagracia's income, along with what her spouse earns working as a mechanic for the large Central Romana corporation, helps support herself and her family members.

Rosa sells bedspreads by catalogue.  With her earnings she pays for transportation costs for her four children.  Her husband takes care of household expenses and other things.  Rosa's problem is that sometimes she has to wait for payment on orders she has already delivered and sometimes she doesn't get paid at all.

His faithful ally in his business is his accordion, with which he plays countless melodies. He works around six hours daily, depending on the number of people who come to the cemetery. \r\n\r\nThe reason he does it, he tells us, is that it is very moving to see people burying their family members, or remembering the year of their passing. But he feels that with his music he can aleviate in part, the pain and sadness that they feel. Sometimes he has cried while he was playing his music, but life goes on, and one has to move forward. \r\n\r\nHe thinks that because of the sensitivity he has, it is going well for him in his business; he understands the pain and suffering that his customers are going through, and that is why he has work. \r\n\r\nEusebio is very happy, and very grateful to the Kiva lenders, as thanks to their help he will be able to undetake the paperwork necessary to obtain his certification as a music teacher.

The market where Mariya works is the only one in the neighborhood and there are few other entrepreneurs offering the same type of goods. This is another reason for Mariya's high sales and the success of her trade. Mariya is requesting a loan of 2500 Grivnas to increase her inventory. She is planning to re-stock her kiosk with clothing items to boost her sales. Being a good steward of the money she receives, Mariya will manage this loan efficiently and repay it on time. Hopefully, one day she'll be able to fulfill her dream and open her own little store of clothing items. \r\n\r\nNote: this is a short term \"seasonal\" loan that will be repaid in two months."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":194868,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"To purchase merchandise","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UA","country":"Ukraine","town":"Uzhgorod","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"48.616667 22.3","type":"point"}},"partner_id":26,"posted_date":"2008-08-26T22:10:21Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mariya","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-09-10T01:56:22Z","disbursal_currency":"UAH","disbursal_amount":2500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2008-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":1250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":275},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":275}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":275,"local_amount":1250,"processed_date":"2008-09-27T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-09-29T07:38:56Z","rounded_local_amount":1267.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339082},{"amount":275,"local_amount":1250,"processed_date":"2008-11-09T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-16T06:07:03Z","rounded_local_amount":1267.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5323197}],"funded_date":"2008-08-27T01:56:22Z","paid_date":"2008-12-16T06:07:03Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Brett & Margaret Silberg","image":null}},{"id":66367,"name":"Rahma","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rahma is 36 years old.

She strives hard so that she is able to provide a good future for her two young children who are only 1 and 5 years old. Josie is 31 years old and lives in the village of Barangay Canjusa, Pulupandan, Negros Occidental, with her young family. Many of her friends look to her as a role model because of her determination to pursue her dreams and do her utmost to put up a small business and build it up so that she is able to help her husband in supporting and sustaining the needs of their family.\r\n\r\nBanking on her cooking skills, Josie decided to put a carinderia - a local eatery selling and serving a variety of cooked dishes. A carinderia is also sometimes called a \"turo-turo\" because the customers literally point to their choice from the array of pots containing the ready-to-eat viands. \r\n\r\nJosie joined NWTF-Project Dunganon in 2002 to access additional capital she needed to open the eatery she planned to set up adjacent to her house. From the start, she tapped the loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon to continually improve her business facilities and widen her food offerings. And because she proved to be an astute businesswoman, her business generates a good income that significantly helps provide for the support of her family, with enough left over for the savings she set up for her two children.\r\n\r\nThe carinderia provides Josie with an average monthly income of PHP 9,000 which is enabling her to gradually fulfill her dreams, including saving enough to renovate and enlarge the space in her carinderia. This, so that she could have more space for the growing number of customers.\r\n\r\nIn her previous loan, Josie borrowed PHP 17,000 to add to her capital and it was fully repaid without any delays. She is now borrowing PHP 17,500 for her 11th loan. She plans to use it again as revolving working capital so that she can purchase more meat and spices and expand the number and volume of her daily food offerings. She plans to save some of the profits so that she can invest in another productive asset that can contribute to the family income. The rest she plans to plow back into her carinderia business.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b> About NWTF:<\/b>\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the call of not just a few, but thousands of women. Through the alleviation program, these women have progressed from earning less than a measly $1 a day, to surpassing realities beyond their dreams. They have learned to live a life where they can finally be called honorable. This is Project Dungganon.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":394502,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

It has produced famous thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. A civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged an already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural productivity and the manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent viable business prospects. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay the tuition fees of her children. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 29 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":541885,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits &

Avil\u00e9s is from Huitzililla, in the city of Ayala, state of Morelos, Mexico.  She is 54 years old, and she has a second grade education.  She has a 16 year old daughter, Rosa Isela, who is working on her high school diploma.  \r\n\r\nShe has a business selling Jafra and Avon by catalog.  She will use the loan to buy the Jafra and Avon products that her customers request.  She will also use it to improve the kitchen in her house.  She has been selling her customers perfumes, lipstick, nail polish, and cosmetics, etc. for three years.  A friend invited her.  First, she started with Avon.  Then she started selling Jafra.  She goes door to door to sell her products.  She shows her catalogs and marks down what they want.  She takes the order and later delivers it to the customer\u2019s house.  She started with her own money.  She has extra products, and her customers go to her house to buy them as presents.  Her business is important because it is used to get food, pay expenses, and pay the loan.\r\n\r\nShe likes everything about her business.  She likes selling Jafra more because she earns more.  It is going well for her, and she gets good earnings.  She is proud of her business when she makes a sale for cash.  Her customers are girls, young women, and ladies.  She sells perfumes, lipstick, nail polish, plastic containers, and cosmetics.  Her business selling Avon is very popular.  The challenge she faces in her business is that sometimes she does not have the money to pay.  When her husband has it, he lends it to her.  She also faces a lot of competition selling Avon and Jafra.  She uses the income from her business to pay the loan.  She is planning on selling \u201cdobladitas\u201d (a type of Chilean bread) and rice tacos.  She plans to do that with the next loan that she is given.  \r\n\r\nThe improvements she wants to make on her house are to plaster the rooms, paint them, and to put down a floor in the kitchen.  Her plans and hopes are to get ahead, improve her house, and to have a truck.  She is very happy with this loan because it will help her business and her family.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":698323,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To buy Jafra and Aavon perfumes and lipsticks and to buy clothes to stock her business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Huitzililla, Morelos","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2011-01-25T18:50:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Luisa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-01-10T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":5000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2011-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2011-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2011-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2011-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2011-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2011-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2011-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":625}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.13},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.12},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.13},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.12},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.13},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.12},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.13},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.12}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":53.13,"local_amount":625,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T03:44:46Z","rounded_local_amount":641.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191430859},{"amount":106.25,"local_amount":1250,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:44:44Z","rounded_local_amount":1282.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195850125},{"amount":106.25,"local_amount":1250,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:10:15Z","rounded_local_amount":1282.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201292399},{"amount":106.25,"local_amount":1250,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:08:51Z","rounded_local_amount":1282.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206160657},{"amount":53.12,"local_amount":625,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:22:06Z","rounded_local_amount":641.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211233534}],"funded_date":"2011-01-25T23:19:30Z","paid_date":"2011-06-15T11:22:06Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ginny Kalish"}},{"id":272082,"name":"Francisca","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Do\u00f1a Francisca actualmente tiene 55 a\u00f1os de edad, actualmente vive con dos  hijas las cuales trabajan y obtienen su propio ingreso apoyando de esta manera en los gastos del hogar,  seg\u00f9n referecias de los vecinos y compa\u00f1eros de trabajo la Sra.

In that ambience of sea breezes and the ocean she undertakes her work selling catalogue merchandise and other items not in catalogues that her customers order from her like perfumes, school supplies, shoes, clothing for women, men and children and, in general, whatever her good customers request.\r\n\r\nThe business started four years ago when she still wasn\u2019t enrolled with any of the catalogue firms; at that time she did it through a friend.  Gradually her customer base grew and she became independent adding a lot more merchandise that wasn\u2019t included in the catalogues and she also subscribed to several magazines in order to sell all kinds of merchandise.\r\n\r\nThis is her 3rd loan with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo and her first with Kiva.  She plans to use it to buy school supplies taking advantage of the season in which schools restart classes and these products are quick sellers.  This investment bodes success because her customers, parents, can satisfy the pressing need to supply their children with books, notebooks, pencils, rulers, etc. needed to do well in school.  In addition, Aida will also sell school uniforms and shoes for students because she\u2019ll buy them in large quantities and then offer generous discounts.  She will sell them to the parents on credit which will make their children\u2019s access to education easier.\r\n\r\nSince starting financing through the Fundaci\u00f3n she\u2019s reached goals in her business, like earning profits to contribute to her home and, above all, having additional capital of her own to respond to customer demand.\r\n\r\nHer greatest challenge is to have a warehouse, to position her business in the marketplace, to increase profits and to continue improving her family\u2019s conditions because she and her spouse work hard and make the effort so that their four children, ranging in ages between 4 and 20, will attain prosperity and success, derived from a quality education, and better future employment

He will use the money to buy raw materials for making cleaning products.  A successful investment is justified because of the demand in his market and the potential expansion into the southern part of the city where he has yet to enter.  His sales are conducted on credit, so he also needs to fund his reserves so that he can respond to new customers and breathe new life into his business.

He is the father of three children.  Two of his children are professionals and the youngest is in his third year of high school.  Francisco has a humble car-wash establishment where, with his own hands and manual tools, he washes cars.  He is very obliging and attentive, despite the fact that his establishment is not at all fancy and doesn't have modern conveniences for washing cars.  He is used by taxi drivers and private vehicle owners who have him carry out their weekly clean.  Before he had this business, he was a driver of private vehicles.  He did this work for more than 30 years and knows how to maintain and clean cars.  For this reason, his customers seek him out to request his services.  He has had this business for two years and he set it up because he didn't have a job and, above all, because he still has one child to support who wants to become a professional, like his siblings.

","en":"Abdurahim is 23 years old and not yet married.  He lives with his mother.  His father died early, and his mother raised him.  His mother previously sold herbs at a market and then transitioned to selling fruits and vegetables.  Her age and weather conditions did not allow her to work often, so Abdurahim and his sister helped their mother with the sales.  The sister got married, and he was left alone with his mother.

They live near the Metropolitan Football (soccer) Stadium which is home to the current Colombian champions Junior of Barranquilla. Antonio works selling sportswear, like the jerseys, shorts, accessories, hats, rattles, and flags of all of the teams, but especially Junior, which has many supporters who always buy gear win or lose. They buy accessories to add to their outfit, and buy more during important parts of the season. \r\n\r\nHe began this job in 2003 as a family business after working for a small business making ceramic souvenirs for special events, but Antonio wanted to earn more money. He started this job because he really enjoys it, has created two jobs, and he works a from 9:00 AM to 9:00 PM. He says that even though there is a lot of competition, the setting awakens the passion of the people on the coast and the market is large enough to provide sales for all the vendors. This is why many of the competitors in this business are friends and good companions to work with. He resupplies his business every two days and he needs capital to maintain his business funds and continue to update and modernize the merchandise he sells.

He has space at a market area near the center of city where he sells a variety of men\u2019s and women\u2019s clothing. Daler has been in business for about eight years.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She remembers that 7 years ago she had a store where she sold a little of everything; unfortunately she closed it for health reasons, as she wasn't able to give it the full attention and energy that it required.  After some time her health improved, and since she had leftover bottles of sodas she began to sell them again, but now she only sells drinks.  Currently her business is in her home where she re-purposed an area to attend to the customers.  She wants to use her loan to buy drinks.  The business that she hopes to have in the future is selling clothes.  She wants to find a place in a commercial zone where she can put a clothes bazaar.  She hopes to achieve this very soon.  On the other hand, as president of the group \"Unidas para alcanzar el exito\" (united to reach success) she is learning a lot.  There are 7 members that make up the group, and they are all very punctual in their payments.\r\n\r\n*Natalia is dressed in the yellow shirt.

His mixed farm produces tea, which he sells through Kenya Tea Development Authority and beans, onions and milk, which are sold to the local market. He also relies on his pension pay to cater to the basic needs of his family. \r\n\r\nHe has requested a loan of 45,000 KES from Juhudi Kilimo to purchase and insure a dairy cow.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets; thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the

She has 5 children who now support themselves. She has her own home, equipped with basic services. She sells corn once it has been processed and also has a car that she uses to transport people. This gives her income during the week. On the weekend she sells food. She has 12 years of experience in these areas, and they have been a good source of income for her single family. There is a lot of competition in the activities she is involved in, but thanks to her experience she has been able to capture a lot of the market and therefore has high demand. This credit will be used to repair her car, because it was in an accident. Since the car is a principal source of income for Margarita, it is important that she repair it. Margarita has had 8 loans with excellent payment history.

Both her children go to school. She resides and rents a one room house where she is staying with three people. Marjorie doesn\u2019t take care of additional family members.  The family has access to electricity and gets three meals a day but has no piped water.\n\n[She incurs   transport costs to and from buying baking materials from Kalerwe market   .]  She works in a semi-urban area which is in the outskirts of Kampala. She owns a stall in Kyebando selling snacks in the market. Marjorie sells all types of snacks ranging from samosas, mandazi chapatti, pan cakes and kebabs.  She works seven days a week and averages 35 customers a day. Her major business challenges include ever increasing prices of cooking oil, wheat and baking flour and the rainy season which disturbs her work because she works in an open place. Her monthly expenses include rent for her residence, monthly market dues, feeding the family and medications. Besides this frying business she also operates a pre-primary school near her home.

Her home is made of cement and has basic services like running water and electricity although the streets are still unpaved.  She is a single mother of two daughters; a 20-year-old university student, and a 13-year-old who is in private school.  About five years ago she began to buy fingernail polish and hair bands.  She would sell them from her house and began to make enough money to set up a store where she sells stuffed toys, greeting cards, make-up, stationery, etc.  Narcisa works from 7:30am until 9pm.  One of her greatest difficulties is having to go to Guayaquil to buy her merchandise.  With the financing she wants to buy more stuffed toys, greeting cards, and  underwear to enlarge her store.  In the future she wants to set up a second store that her 20-year-old daughter can run.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":456201,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Stuffed toys, underwear, make-up.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Guayaquil (Paraiso)","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":147,"posted_date":"2009-12-23T23:40:24Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":700,"lender_count":26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Narcisa Jesus","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-12-17T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":700,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":68.12},{"due_date":"2010-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":71.58},{"due_date":"2010-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":74.78},{"due_date":"2010-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":75.31},{"due_date":"2010-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":77.56},{"due_date":"2010-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":79.2},{"due_date":"2010-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":81.42},{"due_date":"2010-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":83.28},{"due_date":"2010-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":88.75}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.12},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.58},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.78},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.31},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.56},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.2},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.42},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.28},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":88.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":68.12,"local_amount":68.12,"processed_date":"2010-01-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:33:17Z","rounded_local_amount":68.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118074083},{"amount":71.58,"local_amount":71.58,"processed_date":"2010-02-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:07:10Z","rounded_local_amount":71.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123910051},{"amount":74.78,"local_amount":74.78,"processed_date":"2010-03-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:00:02Z","rounded_local_amount":74.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128945616},{"amount":75.31,"local_amount":75.31,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:17:54Z","rounded_local_amount":75.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136673979},{"amount":77.56,"local_amount":77.56,"processed_date":"2010-05-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:16:16Z","rounded_local_amount":77.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144708140},{"amount":79.2,"local_amount":79.2,"processed_date":"2010-06-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:46:09Z","rounded_local_amount":79.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151891343},{"amount":81.42,"local_amount":81.42,"processed_date":"2010-07-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:09:42Z","rounded_local_amount":81.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159631611},{"amount":83.28,"local_amount":83.28,"processed_date":"2010-08-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:14:08Z","rounded_local_amount":83.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166845506},{"amount":88.75,"local_amount":88.75,"processed_date":"2010-09-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:06:02Z","rounded_local_amount":88.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172111801}],"funded_date":"2009-12-25T14:45:24Z","paid_date":"2010-10-15T10:06:02Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":169107,"name":"Lem","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lem H., 30, is married and lives with her only child in Dangkao, Cambodia.

She has been selling cosmetics through her direct-selling line of the popular cosmetics brands.\r\n\r\nMary Ann has been a regular member of Center for Community Transformation (CCT) for more than a year now. She regularly attends their weekly fellowship meetings* and pays her weekly dues consistently. Because of her good repayment performance with her previous loans, she was able to borrow five times in CCT\u2019s cooperative. She is consistent in paying her dues because she used the money she borrowed to expand and improve her direct-selling business.\r\n\r\nNow, with your help, Mary Ann would like to obtain a PHP 10,000 loan.

Her dream of having her own business came true when she received loans after joining ASHI.\r\n\r\nAt first, Lulu had a small \u201csari-sari\u201d store. Sari-sari means a store attached to a house where various kinds of foodstuff, beverages and other basic commodities are sold. A lot of people from the village are customers of this kind of store because this is the most convenient way they can access things they need every day without spending on transportation costs. Lulu and her family enjoyed the small proceeds her business brought them. \r\n\r\nEventually, through her successive loans from ASHI, Lulu was able to purchase a \u201cpedicab\u201d (a bicycle with sidecar) for a transportation business managed by her husband. Lulu and her husband have four children to support and so they both have to work hard and earn through their own business. Lulu\u2019s youngest child is two years old and the eldest is 26. Her oldest and her second oldest child, who is 24, are both working as computer programmers for small private shops in town. Both are not earning well, and so Lulu still supports some of their needs as well as the needs of her three other children. \r\n\r\nBecause Lulu\u2019s husband\u2019s pedicab is operated using a bicycle, he earns only a small income by the end of each day of hard work. Lulu is requesting a loan through ASHI to purchase a motorcycle to replace her husband\u2019s bicycle. With this, his income will grow and he will be able to support the improvement of their standard of living.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":535096,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Motorcycle

Alice is a hard-grinding business lady. The 50-year-old married mother of five school-going children sweats her guts out buying and selling animals like cows as well as selling milk from the cows and selling matooke (green plantain) from her plantation.

M. lives in San Jacinto Bolivar, a town where artisan tradition is the favorite activity of the population as it is handed down from generation to generation.  It is normal to go into any home in this town in the department of Bolivar and find a vertical loom with woven fabric being made for the beautiful hammocks, knapsacks and other beautiful crafts produced here. \r\n\r\nThis is precisely what Gelen does.  She is 28 years old and lives with her husband and 4-year old son.  Honoring tradition she weaves fabric as a source of income but also sells fast food.  This is her third loan through the Mario Santo Domingo foundation and her first through Kiva.  She plans to use it to buy raw materials to make hammocks.  She believes it will be a sound investment since she already has orders for the rest of the year.  She also plans to buy ingredients for her fast food products.  She will get a good discount since she plans to buy wholesale quantities, bringing down her production costs, increasing her competitiveness and allowing her to pass on savings by lowering the sale price. \r\n\r\nGelen has always enjoyed being a merchant.  She used to sell beauty products through specialized magazines.  With that experience she was able to develop her entrepreneurial skills such as those used in her current fast food business, which she runs every evening, and her craft selling business which she runs together with a friend she has in Bogot\u00e1, Colombia, and in the seaside city of Santa Marta.\r\n\r\nThe fast food activity was begun because there was nothing similar in this busy area.  Regarding the craft business, she started out when friends and family began ordering her products.  She was able to earn a little capital which she reinvested.  Her dream and goal is to have a large company through her hard work so she can provide a good future for her son and expand her home to have a large space out of which to work.  Her short-term plans are to make some home improvements.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling food products in the local community. Gemma has been engaged in her business for over 8 years and earns approximately 5,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Gemma joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Gemma has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to invest in expanding the business. Gemma is requesting a new loan of 10000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional canned goods, coffee, sugar, rice and bread to sell. This loan will be the 4th loan taken out by Gemma from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand the business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines.

His goal for later on is to complete his Internet caf\u00e9 to earn income to support his youngest daughter\u2019s university studies.\r\n\r\nAt present, Wilson finds himself applying for a Kiva loan to buy a computer, to stock the cooler with soft-drinks and beverages and to buy reams of paper and ink for his transcriptions business'  use.  With this he is sure of a successful investment because he was running short on services and his customers were looking for other alternatives.  This way, they\u2019ll be satisfied with the really cold beverages they\u2019ll find in the intense heat and high ambient temperatures typical of the town of Malambo thanks to the new investment in Wilson\u2019s refrigerator.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":864463,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Soft Drinks","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to stock his cooler with soft-drinks and beverages, to buy a computer and to buy reams of paper and ink for his transcriptions business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Malambo-Atl\u00e1ntico","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2011-09-12T18:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":575,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Wilson ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-08-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":67728},{"due_date":"2011-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":74753},{"due_date":"2011-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":76497},{"due_date":"2012-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":78282},{"due_date":"2012-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":80109},{"due_date":"2012-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":81978},{"due_date":"2012-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":83891},{"due_date":"2012-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":85848},{"due_date":"2012-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":87851},{"due_date":"2012-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":89901},{"due_date":"2012-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":91999},{"due_date":"2012-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":101163}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.94},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.99},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.98},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.01},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.07},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.13},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.24},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.36},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.52},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.69},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.9},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":38.94,"local_amount":67728,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:18:12Z","rounded_local_amount":69397.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238614945},{"amount":42.99,"local_amount":74753,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-26T08:50:09Z","rounded_local_amount":76595.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244568887},{"amount":43.74,"local_amount":76070,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T10:20:23Z","rounded_local_amount":77945.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257188605},{"amount":91.32,"local_amount":158818,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:34:50Z","rounded_local_amount":162732.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263324817},{"amount":47.13,"local_amount":81978,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T09:32:02Z","rounded_local_amount":83998.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270038872},{"amount":48.24,"local_amount":83891,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:43:28Z","rounded_local_amount":85958.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276651029},{"amount":49.36,"local_amount":85848,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T15:58:40Z","rounded_local_amount":87964.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283140637},{"amount":102.21,"local_amount":177752,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:36:13Z","rounded_local_amount":182133.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294338171},{"amount":111.07,"local_amount":193162,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:03:27Z","rounded_local_amount":197923.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301394765}],"funded_date":"2011-10-08T04:53:26Z","paid_date":"2012-09-15T10:03:27Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":337696,"name":"Nelsa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This is Nelsa, 48, a resident of Baseco, Manila, Philippines.

In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store that retails groceries, toiletries, and beverages in small quantities to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, 5 pesos worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns money by purchasing supplies at wholesale prices and selling them by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Aside from this she also earns additional income from rugs and accessories that she sells. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 300 Philippine pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a loan of 8,000 PHP. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.\r\n\r\nNelsa hopes to be able to expand soon, and she dreams to be able to give her children a good and high quality education through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week, where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility.

This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.

Her husband is trying to build her a store on the small lot on which they live.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Laure Kwon, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":276504,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"The loan was used to buy maca [an Andean root vegetable] for her grocery store","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":93,"posted_date":"2009-02-23T02:00:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":175,"lender_count":6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sonia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-02-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":160,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":40}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":104.32,"local_amount":95.38,"processed_date":"2009-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T17:47:17Z","rounded_local_amount":104.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27084922},{"amount":70.68,"local_amount":64.62,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-21T07:42:30Z","rounded_local_amount":70.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44439290}],"funded_date":"2009-02-23T02:13:20Z","paid_date":"2009-06-21T07:42:30Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"L K","image":355766}},{"id":95098,"name":"Rosemary Janet Awuor","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rosemary Janet Awuor is a 32-year-old mother of three children aged 16, 7 and 3.

Its membership includes 15 women, all of them adults and residents of the same neighborhood.\r\n<p>\r\nRight now the committee works in 10-month cycles, receiving an average of 540,000 for each member. These recipients use their loans for the economic activities detailed below, of which you will see the majority are street vendors that sell various products.\r\n<p>\r\nIt should be mentioned that as well as the financial assistance that these women receive, they also benefit from non-financial services such as training each cycle, in which they learn to maintain the integrity of the committee, to save and to carry out their personal and family budgets. This encapsulates all the benefits that they receive from the program Comit\u00e9 de Mujeres Emprendedoras (Enterprising Women\u2019s Committee) that promotes the foundation Paraguaya de Cooperaci\u00f3n y Desarollo (Cooperation and Development of Paraguay). \r\n<p>\r\nThe members of the Committee thank the foundation Paraguaya for bringing them these types of opportunities that promote the creation of small businesses and generate economic resources for sectors that are not favored for this type of benefits. \r\n<p>\r\n1.\tFrancisca C.

es una mujer de 36 a\u00f1os, su af\u00e1n de progreso la llevaron a potenciar sus capacidades comerciales en beneficio de su familia, pues sus hijos son su mayor motivador. Elegir la venta de productos naturales ha sido una de las mejores decisiones que tom\u00f3, ya que  estos productos son muy solicitados debido a sus propiedades curativas, por lo que es un negocio muy rentable. Para obtener mayores pedidos, Julia sale a ofrecer sus productos de casa en casa a sus clientes, siendo largas horas de caminata pues recorre varios lugares de su ciudad, regresando a altas horas de la noche a su casa. Por ello, para evitar estas caminatas, Julio desea invertir en la instalaci\u00f3n de una tienda naturista en su casa, ya que la empresa con la que trabaja le puede brindar facilidades de pago para obtener grandes cantidades de productos y espera aprovechar esta oportunidad. Este es su octavo cr\u00e9dito con Microfinanzas PRISMA, en su banco comunal, lo que m\u00e1s le agrada es el esfuerzo que cada miembro realiza para el progreso de su grupo. Con los 2000 soles que ahora solicita incrementar\u00e1 su capital de trabajo para obtener mayor cantidad de productos.","en":"Julia is a 36 year-old woman.  Her family\u2019s welfare drives her to maximize her business capacity.  Her children are her primary motivation. Her choice to sell natural products has been one of the best decisions that she has made. These products are very much in demand because of their curative properties. It is a profitable business. To obtain the most requests for her products, Julia sells them door to door to her customers. She works long hours selling her products in various neighborhoods in the city. She returns to her house late at night. In order to stop working such late hours, Julia would like to install a permanent natural products store at her house. In this way she can buy a larger quantity of products from the company that she represents. This is her eighth loan with PRISMA Microfinance, a cooperative bank. She is most thankful for the effort that each member makes towards the progress of the group.

Six years ago, she started a small grocery store out of her home.  During this time, her business became well-known and favorite establishment in her town because of the friendly attention she gives to her customers.  Lately, her customers have been buying on credit and paying at the end of the month because of financial difficulties.  Meanwhile her shelves remain empty.  Her partner works in the early morning hours on a farm, but his salary is not enough to cover their expenses.  In order to restock her store and keep it attractive, Olinda prepares food on the weekends and sells it from her house in order to generate more income.\r\n<p>\r\nThis will be her third loan from MFP.  Olinda repaid her previous loans responsibly and she is very comfortable with her Communal Bank and her role as the group secretary.

For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

He will also use a portion of this loan to increase his working capital. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1900,"image":{"id":584484,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy more dairy products to sell to his customers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MN","country":"Mongolia","town":"Chingeltei, Ulaanbaatar","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"46 105","type":"point"}},"partner_id":116,"posted_date":"2010-08-17T03:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1900,"lender_count":68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Batbaatar","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-08-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MNT","disbursal_amount":2500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":208333.33},{"due_date":"2010-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":208333.33},{"due_date":"2010-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":208333.33},{"due_date":"2010-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":208333.33},{"due_date":"2011-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":208333.33},{"due_date":"2011-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":208333.33},{"due_date":"2011-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":208333.33},{"due_date":"2011-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":208333.33},{"due_date":"2011-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":208333.33},{"due_date":"2011-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":208333.33},{"due_date":"2011-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":208333.33},{"due_date":"2011-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":208333.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":158.33},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":158.34},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":158.33},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":158.33},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":158.34},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":158.33},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":158.33},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":158.34},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":158.33},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":158.33},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":158.34},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":158.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":160.21,"local_amount":210800,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:52:57Z","rounded_local_amount":212275.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172194303},{"amount":158.46,"local_amount":208505.2,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T16:41:14Z","rounded_local_amount":209964.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177489981},{"amount":158.35,"local_amount":208349.03,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T16:01:41Z","rounded_local_amount":209807.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182626313},{"amount":156.88,"local_amount":206425.43,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T15:08:25Z","rounded_local_amount":207870.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188764231},{"amount":158.57,"local_amount":208647.51,"processed_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-17T01:38:07Z","rounded_local_amount":210108.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191613072},{"amount":157.6,"local_amount":207365.94,"processed_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T09:11:56Z","rounded_local_amount":208817.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":196057253},{"amount":401.28,"local_amount":528006.57,"processed_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-16T08:30:47Z","rounded_local_amount":531702.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201495475},{"amount":548.65,"local_amount":721900.32,"processed_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-21T07:55:12Z","rounded_local_amount":726953.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206930336}],"funded_date":"2010-08-17T10:21:15Z","paid_date":"2011-05-21T07:55:12Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Joe Castrovinci","image":442131}},{"id":227053,"name":"Mame Marie Fall","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Madame Mame Marie Fall B. est une femme de 46 ans qui habite a la cite Ousmane Fall dans la localit\u00e9 de Dalifort.
