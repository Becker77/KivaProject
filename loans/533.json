Her oldest son helps Ibodat with the business. Ibodat begins her workday early each morning at 5:00 a.m. In practice, she buys vegetables and fruits from the local farmers, and she then sells such produce in the market, where she is well-known among the local shoppers because of her friendliness and the fact that she sells her fruits and vegetables for reasonable prices. Accordingly, Ibodat\u2019s business generates a stable, considerable income for her family. <p>\r\nNow, it is the prime season in which to sell fruits and vegetables, and (not surprisingly) her goods are in great demand. In addition, she wants to expand her business in order to generate even greater income to cover the higher education expenses that her darling children will soon need. For this reason, she is planning to purchase more fresh fruits and vegetables to sell in the market, and in order to do so she is seeking a loan in the amount of 1,500 Somoni ($450), to be repaid within 8 months.

She has made home improvements with her previous loans.  With this loan, she wants to invest in the infrastructure of her home: to replace the roof and to fix her room which is in bad shape.  She will buy zinc, beams, purlins and other building materials so that she can have peace of mind as she could not relax this past winter as everything was getting wet and had to be hung to dry.  Her goal is to continue her studies so that she can get a better job with better pay.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Laure Kwon, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":253351,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":null,"use":"To buy building materials to replace her roof.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Managua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.150833 -86.268333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":98,"posted_date":"2009-02-01T08:00:38Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ivania Del Carmen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-08T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":6000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2009-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2009-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2009-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2009-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2009-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2009-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2009-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2009-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":666.64}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":36.11},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":36.11},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.11},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.11},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.11},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.11},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.11},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.11},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.12}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":36.35,"local_amount":671.06,"processed_date":"2009-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-15T08:24:02Z","rounded_local_amount":725.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20351558},{"amount":36.44,"local_amount":672.82,"processed_date":"2009-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T09:10:02Z","rounded_local_amount":727.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27038895},{"amount":36.51,"local_amount":674.19,"processed_date":"2009-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T09:46:41Z","rounded_local_amount":728.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35929191},{"amount":36.68,"local_amount":677.12,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T20:23:47Z","rounded_local_amount":731.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44384103},{"amount":36.22,"local_amount":668.64,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T16:31:21Z","rounded_local_amount":722.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52890566},{"amount":36.62,"local_amount":676,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T09:39:09Z","rounded_local_amount":730.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63111864},{"amount":36.71,"local_amount":677.74,"processed_date":"2009-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T09:51:44Z","rounded_local_amount":732.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73533280},{"amount":36.29,"local_amount":669.93,"processed_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T10:01:29Z","rounded_local_amount":723.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":86964658},{"amount":33.18,"local_amount":612.5,"processed_date":"2009-10-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T10:41:33Z","rounded_local_amount":661.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96875131}],"funded_date":"2009-02-03T16:43:52Z","paid_date":"2009-11-15T10:41:33Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"L K","image":355766}},{"id":87310,"name":"Helena","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Helena O. is 30 years old.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He is responsible for a family, married, the father of two children. He is also responsible for two other relatives who are his wards. \r\n\r\nSince he did not succeed in his studies, he took up an apprenticeship as a tailor which is an activity he chose because he loves it. Thus, since 1994, he has been working full time at this trade, and four years ago he got his own workshop. He makes ready-to-wear and \"boubous\" (long flowing traditional robes worn by men and women) which are much in demand among Nigerians. \r\n\r\nMr. D. has been a member of the Baye Laye branch since May 2010. He is requesting a loan of 500,000 francs which will be totally used to fund the creation of ready-to-wear. This loan will bolster the working capital of Mr. D., who will then be able to meet the ever-growing demand of his clientele. The increase in profit will allow him to better support his family.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Teresa Kramer, Kiva

But with the passage of time, her clientele grew and she started buying tools and professional accessories.  \r\n\r\nShe also sells beef during the morning to friends and neighbors in the neighborhood.  She sells it to them on credit and they repay weekly or biweekly.\r\n\r\nThis is the second loan she has negotiated with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo and her first Kiva loan.  She plans to use it to remodel the floor in the room where her beauty salon operates and to buy more beef.\r\n\r\nThe two businesses together produce a monthly profit of approximately $700.000.  She dreams with setting up a great beauty salon in a different part of her residence with air conditioning and other comforts that will make it possible for her to offer better service.\r\n\r\nMost of

It is known for its rich pre-colonial culture.  It is also known for its handicrafts, which are recognized on a national and international level.  Most of the inhabitants here devote themselves to making buttons out of \u201ctagua\u201d (Tagua has been called 'vegetable ivory' because the hard tagua nut has a white endosperm similar to elephant ivory), handicrafts, and general commerce.\r\n\r\nThis is where we meet Bertha, age 65.  Several years ago her beloved husband died.  His death left her alone with their six children.  Now they are adults, and the youngest still lives in her house.\r\n\r\nShe is a very good housewife who searched for the way to get her children ahead.  She sells all types of clothes.  She works the last three days of the week, and she sells door to door.  She tells us that the majority of her sales are done through orders.  On these three days she makes sales, delivers orders, and collects because she extends credit.  She collects every two weeks.  \r\n\r\nShe buys her merchandise in Guayaquil because that is where she gets a greater variety of products.  She has had this business for three years.

Growing up in Chimbote, Peru, his interest in business was piqued early by watching his parents. His father worked at a local restaurant while his mother sold vegetables and fruits. Oftentimes, he would join his mother on these pursuits and learned the tricks of the trade from her.\r\n\r\nHis parents\u2019 tremendous influence stayed with him as he moved from Peru to San Francisco in 2004. While working a series of miscellaneous jobs, Yeral\u2019s desire to open up his own business grew. However, as a recent immigrant, he didn\u2019t know how to get things started.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, his drive to become an entrepreneur propelled him to get into business the way he knew best:  Yeral began serving delicious Peruvian treats at food festivals.  In order to secure a spot at a Peruvian Food Festival, he needed a loan to pay the initial fee but when he turned to a major bank, he was refused credit because he did not have tax returns, a business license or a business bank account. \r\n\r\nWithout a set destination, he marched through San Francisco\u2019s Mission district, adamant that somewhere in the sea of pay-day loans and pawn shops, he would find a financial institution that would help him.  At last, he stumbled upon Opportunity Fund, where the staff recognized his potential and his passion.  Yeral got the cash he needed to capitalize his business, as well as a foothold into the mainstream American financial system.\r\n\r\nAt last year\u2019s Peruvian Food Festival, Yeral sold over 400 plates of food and gained recognition for his talent making tasty Peruvian treats.  He wants to return again this year, and this time he expects to sell closer to 800 plates of food, doubling his business over last year. Yeral needs a second loan for $4,000 in order to buy more inventory and secure his spot at this year\u2019s Peruvian Food Festival, which will be held in July.  \r\n\r\nCurrently, Yeral devotes 50% of his time to expanding his business and he spends the other 50% working at a bar. He aims to expand his business so that one day he can devote 100% of his energy to serving delicious Peruvian treats.

","en":"Alex, age 37, lives in the rural village of Tapikilares in the San Francisco Yojoa municipality.  He has been married to his wife, Mirna, for 15 years.  The couple has three children; ages 15, 13, and 2.\r\n\r\nAlex grows corn, and he currently has two \u201cmanzanas\u201d (a land measurement unit equivalent to 7000 square meters or 1.728 acres) of land.  He learned this trade from his parents, who were farmers.  Alex has devoted himself to farming since he was a boy.  He continues with this business activity that he inherited in order to improve his family\u2019s standard of living.  His children also participate in the farming activities when they are not in school.\r\n\r\nAfter the harvest Alex usually takes the corn to the market to sell and to trade.  When there is an abundance of corn the prices drop.  When there is a scarcity, Alex does not have to go to the market because the buyers come to look for corn in communities like his.  Alex takes advantage of this to raise his prices and get better income.\r\n\r\nAlex will use this loan for 5,000 lempiras to invest in farming.  This is the first loan that he has managed.  He hopes to continue with the farming activity in order to finish educating his children.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":910829,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to invest in growing corn.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"Tapikilares","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15 -86.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":201,"posted_date":"2011-11-06T23:30:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":275,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alex Omar","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":5000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":5000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":275}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":275,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-16T08:38:15Z","rounded_local_amount":5211.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270120247}],"funded_date":"2011-11-13T22:06:08Z","paid_date":"2012-04-16T08:38:15Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ginny Kalish"}},{"id":358627,"name":"Virgilio","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Virgilio is 51 years old and is married with one child.

Thus, her family's daily income is from 180,000VND to 200,000VND (about 11USD to 12USD). Mrs. Soi likes to borrow through the SEDA Fund because she is allowed to repay the loans on an installment basis, as well as borrow regularly with no collateral required. Besides, she can also save some money to financially help her children and her grand children.

Despite the fact that, for work reasons, her husband is not by her side, she tries to put all of her love into her two children.  With great happiness she works in the buying and selling of liquors, a business that began 16 years ago when her oldest son gave her the idea to travel to the city of Ica (famous for its wines and piscos) to buy liquors wholesale and bring them back to the capital.  Her whole family helps finish the decoration and preparation of the products for sale.  She does this every 15 days since she must travel constantly to fill her orders.  \r\n\r\nYears of working in this business have worn her out and she is thinking of a way to continue working, but in a more relaxed way, because the trips are very tiring.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She has a small grocery store where she sells basic needs items.\r\n\r\nShe is asking for funding to stock her store.  Her husband, Efrain, is an urban taxi driver.  Thanks to their combined efforts, they have owned their own house and vehicle for a year now.\r\n\r\nThe couple had a recent setback that almost caused them to lose all their belongings.  What happend was:  the wife lent herself some money to pay for her husband's trip abroad where work conditions would provide higher income.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

His oldest child is 24 years old and the youngest is 8.  Childebek has a secondary education and works as a welder.  As an additional source of income, he has also been involved in animal husbandry for many years.  His children take an active part in the farm work.  Thanks to his very hard work and back-breaking labor, Childebek has been quite successful in his business.  He currently has three cows, one calf, two heifers and ten sheep on his farm and he makes a monthly income of 7,200 som (KGS) in addition to the 8,500 som (KGS) he makes as a welder.  However, this amount of money is still insufficient for a decent life and to raise his children.  \r\n\r\nChildebek wants to further develop his farming business and improve the material situation of his family and, for this reason, he has turned to Bai Tushum Bank CJSC and requested a loan of 60,000 som (KGS) to buy a few calves.  Childebek is the third member of the \"Tamara\" group which comprises a total of three people.  He is planning to use the earnings from his loan to further develop his business, educate his children and improve his family's material well-being.\r\n"}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1908628,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"to purchase some calves in order to increase the his family's income.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Kyzyl-Ozgorush village, Jalalabat region","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Childebek","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-05-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":60000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2015-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-03-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2016-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":20000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":333.34},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":333.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sophie Narayan","image":1284174}},{"id":1302,"name":"Patricia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"My name is Patricia D. and I sell juices, churros and cookies.

John has to meet his customers\u2019 demands if he is to remain in business. He has therefore decided to start stocking these items, which are in very high demand in his area. The only impediment to this is a lack of coolers, which he will need in order to keep the products fresh.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Another one of this dreams is to have aqueducts in 100% of his pens.

He is married and has three children ages 7 to 17 who all attend school.  Xavier attended school through high school, but did not continue due to the distance from his home to the university.  He lives in his own home and supports his parents who live in Zambezia, sending them 2.000.00mt every 6 months. \r\n\r\nXavier was recruited to be a soldier.

He works two 24 hour shifts followed by two consecutive days of rest, earning 5.500.00mt per month. With his wife's help he was able to build a coop and begin raising chickens to increase his family's income.  However, he did not have sufficient funds and had many orders, so he came to Hluvuku and Kiva to request a loan to increase his flock.  He has raised 4X100 boxes of chicks, spending 30.000.00mt and with a profit of 10.000.00mt depending greatly on mortality rates and the time of sale. \r\n\r\nThis is his fourth loan with Hluvuku and his second with Kiva.  It is for 22.000.00mt which he will use to purchase chicks to increase his flock.

She earns her living by operating 3 businesses: food production\/sales, a general store and an entertainment business. Her husband, Larry T., is 49 years old and works as a laborer to earn his living. He also helps in his wife's business activities. They have three children aged between 19 and 24 years old. Gilda joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1997 because she hoped for something better for her family. With the help of her past 18 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Gilda has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 29,500 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 10,000, raising the family's standard of living. This time, for her 19th loan, she is borrowing PHP 30,000, which she intends to use to buy more stock for the general store and spices for her food production business. She wants to continue to save up for her children's future education and for home appliances. Gilda T. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\n<p>About NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams.

There he started his family, together with his wife whom he has lived with for 22 years. They have 7 children, whom they look after with great love and tenderness, in their own house. The area they live in is a remote spot, which not only has beautiful countryside but also very fertile soil. When he was very young, F\u00e9lix began to find his way into agriculture, making the most of the quality of the soil. He now has 5 years' experience sowing beans, peas, potatoes and maize, which he takes care of constantly. He now needs the nutrients necessary to ensure a good quality crop. What F\u00e9lix likes most about his work is being able to see his produce grow; nonetheless he worries that all the effort may not turn into good profits when the time comes to sell, thanks to fluctuations in the price of products at the market. Because of this, he has just begun raising small animals, such as pigs and hens, which sell for a good price once they are fattened up. In this way he can generate aditional earnings while awaiting the next harvest season and the sale of his produce. He belongs to the \u201cNueva Jerusal\u00e9n\u201d communal bank, and this is his 7th loan with [field partner] MFP, where he is happy to know that he can access the financial support he needs. He vows to be punctual in meeting his repayments. On receiving the support, F\u00e9lix intends to plant potatoes, of the varieties \"canchan\" and \"yungay\". He will invest the money in buying several sacks of natural fertilizers to begin a successful planting: following this he predicts he should be able to produce some 200 sacks of potaoes.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":814997,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy sacks of natural fertilizers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-07-20T23:10:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Felix ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-07-06T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":375}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":375,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:42:37Z","rounded_local_amount":1027.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244621450}],"funded_date":"2011-07-21T01:54:43Z","paid_date":"2011-12-15T10:42:37Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Rosa Oswald","image":null}},{"id":321743,"name":"Valijon","description":{"languages":["ru","en"],"texts":{"ru":"\u0412\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0447\u043e\u043d \u0436\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c \u0433\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0430 \u0425\u0443\u0434\u0436\u0430\u043d\u0434. \u0415\u043c\u0443 23 \u0433\u043e\u0434\u0430. \u041e\u043d \u0436\u0435\u043d\u0430\u0442. \u0414\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0439 \u043d\u0435 \u0438\u043c\u0435\u0435\u0442. \u0415\u0433\u043e \u0436\u0435\u043d\u0430 \u0434\u043e\u043c\u043e\u0445\u043e\u0437\u044f\u0439\u043a\u0430. \u0421\u0430\u043c \u0412\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0447\u043e\u043d \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0432\u043b\u044f\u0435\u0442 \u0443\u0441\u043b\u0443\u0433\u0443, \u043e\u043d \u0440\u0430\u0437\u0432\u043e\u0437\u0438\u0442 \u043b\u044e\u0434\u0435\u0439 \u043f\u043e \u043c\u0430\u0440\u0448\u0440\u0443\u0442\u0443 \u0425\u0443\u0434\u0436\u0430\u043d\u0434 - \u041d\u043e\u0432 \u0438 \u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0442\u043d\u043e. \u042d\u0442\u0438\u043c \u0432\u0438\u0434\u043e\u043c \u0434\u0435\u044f\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438 \u043e\u043d \u0437\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0443\u0436\u0435 \u0434\u0432\u0430 \u0433\u043e\u0434\u0430. \u041a\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0438\u0442 \u0431\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0442 \u0434\u043b\u044f \u0440\u0435\u043c\u043e\u043d\u0442\u0430 \u0430\u0432\u0442\u043e\u043c\u043e\u0431\u0438\u043b\u044f \u0413\u0430\u0437\u0435\u043b\u044c, \u0447\u0442\u043e\u0431\u044b \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0442\u044c \u0431\u0435\u0437\u043e\u043f\u0430\u0441\u043d\u0443\u044e \u0443\u0441\u043b\u0443\u0433\u0443.","en":"Valijon is a resident of Khujand.

Christine and two other promoters in her community, including Ann and Anna, need a loan to cover the costs of installing and maintaining chlorine dispensers at the water sources in the area.

Using the chlorine dispenser generates carbon credits by avoiding the need to boil water to make it safe to drink. Revenues from the sale of carbon credits to organizations and individuals wanting to reduce their carbon footprint will be used to repay Kiva lenders and also to make sure that Christine\u2019s community can have access to safe water now and in the future.\n"}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1807015,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Health","sector":"Health","themes":["Innovative Loans","Water and Sanitation"],"use":"To provide communities with free access to chlorine to treat their drinking water","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kuria East","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":324,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1350,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Christine ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ann ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Anna ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-01-15T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1350,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":72,"loan_amount":1350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2018-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":337.5},{"due_date":"2019-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":337.5},{"due_date":"2020-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":450}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2019-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":337.5},{"due_date":"2020-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":337.5},{"due_date":"2021-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":450}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":937217,"name":"Jlg-016(A)-Thanneerpalli Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Selvarani is a 27-year-old married woman hailing from Karur district of Tamil Nadu in the southern part of India.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\nIMON's History\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

M\u1eabn B\u00e1 is a 57-year-old male living in the town of Y\u00ean Phong - B\u1eafc Ninh.  He is married and has two adult-aged children.  To make a living, N. operates a family member's business venture in the agriculture sector, raising livestock. The main source of income for the business comes from raising cattle for sale.  N. has been engaged in this business for over four years and earns approximately $163 a month from this activity.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, N. joined SEDA to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and his ability to engage in business activities.  N. has successfully repaid a previous loan of 4.704.000 VND from SEDA.  This previous loan was used to purchase livestock feed and other supplies.  \r\n\r\nN. is now requesting a new loan of 7.804.000 VND which also will be used to purchase livestock feed and other supplies.

Winter temperatures can average -20 Celsius.  60% of the city population live in tents called gers, with wooden frames covered by layers of wool felt. On average, households located in the Ger Districts use 5 tons of coal and 1.5 tons of wood per year. 60% of the pollution in the city during the heating season is attributed to coal burned in the Ger Districts. The bottom fifth quintile spend as much as 40% of their monthly winter income on heating fuels.\r\n\r\nXacBank has worked with MicroEnergy Credits to launch a line of eco-products consisting of energy efficient stoves and ger blankets, which will reduce energy consumption."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":100,"image":{"id":483015,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing

Their income from this activity is the source for meeting Eden\u2019s family's needs. This livelihood has supported the education of her only child (who is now 30 years old) in college until his graduation from a two-year course in agriculture. While he is not yet employed, he has been a great help to his parents in their rice-farming business. \r\n<br>Compared to the average expenses that a farmer should spend on rice farming, it is now a very expensive occupation because the prices of farm inputs and equipment rentals are higher than before. Eden and her husband, just like all those who had no opportunity to access a loan with low interest, would take a loan from money lenders who charge huge amounts of interest. Therefore, after harvesting and selling the rice, their profit would be very small and not even enough to support their family's basic needs. \r\n<br>As a consequence, Eden and her husband agreed to obtain loans from Kiva partner, ASHI, since becoming a member in 2007. Eventually, life has become easier and enjoyable for her and her family, although their business is still unstable and has not grown so well. Eden is hoping that with the loan she is requesting now, her business would improve a bit

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

One of her children is grown up and the two younger ones are still attending school.  Together they work hard to get ahead.  The day begins very early in the morning for this determined woman since, after seeing to her children, she starts work in her business selling soda and beer outside her house.  She is very happy because her work makes her regular profits which allow her to help her husband with the constant household expenses.  She also considers it to be a calm job because she can work from the comfort of her own home and not neglect her children.  She says that she started out with some soda and now sells quite a lot, especially on a weekend.  She has some regular customers and she offers them goods on credit.  As the summer season is approaching she would like to increase her merchandise.  She also plans, in the future, to begin selling some food products and ice cream.  This is her fourth loan with MFP and she pledges to make her repayments in a timely manner because she doesn't want to let down the people who made the loan possible.  The loan will allow her to continue working in search of progress.

She took advantage of her knowledge of how to prepare fried foods and started with just a large bowl in front of her house. She later added stuffed potatoes, pastries, lunches, and now fast foods, and this is how she has succeeded in supporting herself and her family. Today, she has three adult children and two who are still in her care. She struggles for them so that they can achieve their dreams and have successful futures.\r\n\r\nThis <i>credikiva<\/i> is Diana's first loan through Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo. She will use it to buy a canopy for her hot dog cart and to invest in purchasing ingredients in larger quantities. She will be able to carry those savings over to her selling prices.\r\n\r\nHer dream is that her adult children will achieve complete independence and that her entire family will improve its quality of life each day."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":875,"image":{"id":815030,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

is 51 years old.  She is engaged in a business buying and selling fruits and vegetables. She has been selling bananas, avocados and ginger around her  village for quite some time. Usually, she goes to the market to sell all her products where she can dispose them all easily. \r\n\r\nDonalia has been doing this for almost 20 years and is now earning an average net income of PHP 5,000 each month. She feels lucky to have a thrifty type of family since sometimes this monthly earning is sufficient, especially now that all her three children are married. \r\n\r\nIn the 20 years in this business, she usually experienced delayed payments from her customers, so she needs to ask for loan assistance to maintain her business operation. Donalia is requesting from ASKI the amount of PHP 12,000 to buy sacks of spices, onions, garlic, and monggo or mung bean, as additional products to sell. She is thankful that ASKI, an MFI partner of KIVA, exists to help her in the

She will invest the amount she is requesting in the purchase of sewing materials and beauty products. \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Sarah Sattin, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":298467,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Tailoring","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"Purchasing sewing materials and beauty products","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-04-05T23:40:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":200,"lender_count":4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-03-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":600,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":63.27},{"due_date":"2009-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":68.24},{"due_date":"2009-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":70.97},{"due_date":"2009-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":73.26},{"due_date":"2009-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":76.3},{"due_date":"2009-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":80.13},{"due_date":"2009-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":82.55},{"due_date":"2009-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":85.28}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.09},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.75},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.66},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.42},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.43},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.71},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.52},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.42}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":21.09,"local_amount":63.27,"processed_date":"2009-04-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:46:22Z","rounded_local_amount":66.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36012392},{"amount":22.75,"local_amount":68.24,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T00:59:44Z","rounded_local_amount":71.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44595980},{"amount":23.66,"local_amount":70.97,"processed_date":"2009-06-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:40:27Z","rounded_local_amount":74.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52990244},{"amount":24.42,"local_amount":73.26,"processed_date":"2009-07-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:41:57Z","rounded_local_amount":76.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63211368},{"amount":25.43,"local_amount":76.3,"processed_date":"2009-08-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:22:48Z","rounded_local_amount":79.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73640876},{"amount":26.71,"local_amount":80.13,"processed_date":"2009-09-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:35:11Z","rounded_local_amount":84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87080345},{"amount":27.52,"local_amount":82.55,"processed_date":"2009-10-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:06:58Z","rounded_local_amount":86.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96996543},{"amount":28.42,"local_amount":85.28,"processed_date":"2009-11-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:54:31Z","rounded_local_amount":89.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103842039}],"funded_date":"2009-04-06T00:35:25Z","paid_date":"2009-12-15T13:54:31Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sarah Sattin","image":291435}},{"id":103758,"name":"Faava","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Faava T., 31, is married with three children.

She and her children live together in the house that she built after many long years of struggle. Despite the difficulties, she does not stop working various jobs, but the one that she is most involved in is cosmetics sales. Her 10 years of experience have helped her gain loyal customers who order from her on a bi-weekly basis. Vitalina\u2019s goal is to increase her orders so that she can win prizes that the company gives out to the women with the highest sales, thus motivating them to keep growing as entrepreneurs. For this, she has set up a stand in her house to offer products, that way, she no longer has to walk door-to-door and expose herself to harsh weather conditions. Vitalina is the founder of her group. She is currently in her fifth loan from MFP, and she hopes to keep working alongside her group members, who have worked together responsibly. With the money that she is requesting, she will purchase wholesale products because as a promoter, she has the chance of obtaining a greater quantity of products at a reasonable price. <br

The official name of this borrowing group is Marife E.\u2019s Group.\r\n\r\nTo make a living, Marife owns and operates a general store.

Marife has been engaged in her business for more than fifteen years and earns approximately 5,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Marife joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Marife has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Marife is requesting a new loan of 14,900 PHP which will be used to purchase additional inventory and working capital. This loan will be the third taken out by Marife from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living condition of her family.\r\n\r\nAbout PMPC: Paglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao.

Para ella es muy importante su trabajo porque de este se mantienen ella y sus familiares y adem\u00e1s porque contribuyen con su trabajo al mantenimiento de la actividad del campo en su localidad. Le gusta sembrar y ver como sus siembre crece y da frutos y que siempre tiene alg\u00fan producto en su casa como cacahuate, ma\u00edz o alegr\u00eda.\nSus clientes son mayoristas que en la temporada de cosecha le compran su producci\u00f3n completa para semilla y tambi\u00e9n conserva algunos costales para vender en la localidad a sus vecinos. Sus ganancias las invierte nuevamente en sus cultivos comprando abono, o para pagar los barbechos de las tierras de labranza.

Algunos de los arreglos que ha hecho en su casa son ampliar la cocina, meter agua potable en su casa.\nLa se\u00f1ora Florentina es viuda, tiene dos hijas Aurora y \u00c1ngela ambas viven con ella y participan de las actividades del campo con su mam\u00e1.

She is 85 years old, and she did not go to school.  She will use the loan primarily to invest in the peanuts and corn that she has planted in the area\u2019s fields.  She also plans to pay the workers that she has at her service.  Also, she will buy food for four piglets that she is fattening.\r\n\r\nShe has been farming for 11 years, and she says that the loan from Kiva and the Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad have greatly helped her; it especially helped increase her business activities.  She tells us that she previously only worked with crops together with her husband.  But, her work has been increasing, and now she even contracts workers to help her.\r\n\r\nShe used to sell traditional sweets at the fairs or in the Ozumba and T\u00e9tela del Vulcan plazas.  She sold \u201cpalanquetas\u201d (similar to peanut brittle), amaranth candy, and tamarind candy.  However, now that she is elderly she prefers not to leave her area.\r\n\r\nThe land where she currently lives and has her crops is an inheritance from her husband.  Normally she goes in her own van to the crops.  Sometimes she also uses this form of transportation to stock her business with merchandise.  Her grandchildren are the ones who help her work in the field.  She personally feeds her pigs.  She tells us that her family likes her business and helps her a lot with the work.\r\n\r\nHer work is very important to her because that is how she supports herself and her family.  It is also important because her work contributes to the maintenance of the fields in her area.  She likes to plant and to see how her plants grow and give fruit.  She always has some product in her house like peanuts, corn, or amaranth.\r\n\r\nHer customers are wholesalers who at harvest time buy her complete production for seed.  She also saves some sacks to sell to her neighbors in the area.  She reinvests her earnings in her crops by purchasing fertilizer or paying to prepare the fields.  Her future plans are to buy two more pieces of land for the next planting season and to introduce sorghum.  Some of the repairs that she has made to her house are expanding the kitchen and putting potable water in her house.\r\n\r\nForentina is a widow.  She has two daughters, Aurora and \u00c1ngela.  They both live with her and participate in the field work with their mother.  Her grandchildren also live with her, and everyone participates in the field work.  She tells us that thanks to the loans from Kiva and the Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad she has been able to improve her quality of life and that of her family.  She is happy to again receive a loan to get more land to keep working as she has been.  She tells us that she likes her community because they still follow the customs of their ancestors, and it is peaceful.\r\n\r\nHer words of gratitude to the Kiva team are the following, \u201cIt gives us pleasure that the loans go to the people that need them, and they continue supporting us with the loans\u201d.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":684351,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy fumigants, pay the workers, and for raising pigs","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"morelos","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2011-01-11T23:10:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":750,"lender_count":29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Florentina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-12-23T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":9000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":900},{"due_date":"2011-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":900},{"due_date":"2011-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":900},{"due_date":"2011-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":900},{"due_date":"2011-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":900},{"due_date":"2011-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":900},{"due_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","amount":900},{"due_date":"2011-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":900},{"due_date":"2011-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":900},{"due_date":"2011-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":900}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":150,"local_amount":1800,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T03:44:46Z","rounded_local_amount":1833.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191430827},{"amount":150,"local_amount":1800,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:44:43Z","rounded_local_amount":1833.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195850080},{"amount":225,"local_amount":2700,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:10:13Z","rounded_local_amount":2750.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201292354},{"amount":150,"local_amount":1800,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:08:50Z","rounded_local_amount":1833.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206160612},{"amount":75,"local_amount":900,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:22:51Z","rounded_local_amount":916.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211233500}],"funded_date":"2011-01-12T03:45:40Z","paid_date":"2011-06-15T11:22:51Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ginny Kalish"}},{"id":268499,"name":"Ma.
