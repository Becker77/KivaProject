is a young 23-year-old retail shop owner. She has operated her business for one year. She takes great care in her appearance as well as the neatness of her business. Her business is located in the Kyebando District of Kampala. Like many districts surrounding Kampala, there is a blend of economic conditions. Within sight of Kyebando on the hillside are million-dollar homes owned by government officials, people running NGO\u2019s, and expat\u2019s. (This is a topic which is absolutely fascinating, very much misunderstood, but is beyond the scope of this article).\r\n<p>\r\nIn Kyebando there are no paved streets, buildings are poorly-constructed, and people navigate along pathways with the occasional whiff of open sewage. It should be noted that there is a very wonderful spirit in these districts. There is vitality to the \u201cstreet scene\u201d that is lacking in communities of more affluence. In Kyebando, everyone knows their neighbors, and mothers watch after their children as they play openly and relatively safely along the paths. As most people are without jobs, much time is spent visiting, laughing and telling stories. There are many small businesses. One reason for this is that starting your own business is the only chance you have to get a job. You may not make much, but you will make something, if you start a business.\r\n<p>\r\nAt Ester's store, she sells soap, toilet paper, candles, dry cells, and soft drinks.

He is an enthusiastic and industrious man, and therefore always encouraging his family to preserve to achieve their goals. He lives in his own house with his wife and his three small children. He has worked as a carpenter for ten years. In the beginning he had many problems installing his workshop and had to work in diverse business to obtain sufficient money to buy his machinery. With time he managed to install a workshop inside their house and is now the most recognized carpenter in the region, because his works are of the highest quality. What pleases Juan most about his work is varnishing the furniture, which causes the furniture to obtain a special beauty. On the other hand, he considers the most difficult part of his work making large furniture for rooms because they have to be finished perfectly, however large furniture is also very profitable because the cost of production is increased for the time invested.

Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Through his business, Rodolfo has generated employment for others, even though he has only a small number of employees, he has supported them and helped them. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p> With his profits, he would like to buy some equipment which would allow him to offer his bakery goods in the various plazas and centers of Managua.   Right now the costs of the business and the ingredients are high and the cost of bread is also higher.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women and uses the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets; thus they are deemed non-creditworthy by financial institutions.

This is 27 year old Anitha R. from Mwanza. She is married with one child the age of one year old. Anitha has been running a poultry business since 2007. Her business is a Poultry\/kuku business.  Raising kuku is a popular micro-business in Tanzania, especially amongst SELFINA clients.\r\n<p>\r\nKuku means \"chickens\" in Swahili and raising them for sale is popular for a number of reasons. Firstly, they require little start-up capital. You can start with one or two and either add to them as you go, or wait for them to multiply naturally! Secondly, they require little space so sometimes you can just let them run around in your garden or compound. Thirdly, while they are growing they produce eggs, which can either be sold to provide a supplementary source of income or eaten to provide a supplementary source of protein.\r\n<p>\r\nShe works at the business for 8 hours per day, 7 days per week and is assisted by one employee. Anitha currently earns about 220 USD from her business. She is requesting a loan of 400 USD in order to purchase more chickens. In the future, she plans to expand her business. Anitha thanks you for your support!\r\n<p>\r\nABOUT SELFINA!\r\n<p>\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":346626,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To purchase more chickens.

She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 750 WST from SPBD. This previous loan was used to purchase fertilizer such as manure.\r\n\r\nMetuli is now requesting a new loan of 1,000 WST which will again be used to purchase fertilizer such as manure. The loan will be her 2nd from SPBD. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay her children\u2019s tuition fees.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>About SPBD:<\/b>\r\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

She lives at home with her mother Floriza, age 45, and her three nephews.  With the conviction she demonstrates, she becomes more successful with each crop.  Berenise is able to generate good yields and earn a nice income.  With the help of her siblings and her mother, she plants bananas, pineapples, and coffee on her own land that she inherited from her mother.  She focuses most of her attention on removing weeds since it keeps her fields clean and allows her crops to grow freely.  Berenise has been farming for the past three years so that she can succeed on behalf of her son, who is her motivation in life.  She also wants to have the ability to save so that she can pay for his future education, build a house, and open a food business.

For the past three years, Yuniya has been working hard to help her mother manage a small shop which sells shoes and other footwear. \n\nTo help expand her business, Yuniya has requested a loan of 400,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more shoes and will help Yuniya to generate greater profits and pay school fees. Yuniya hopes that in the future she will be able to open her own retail business. \n\nYuniya is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills training. The ELA program has increased Yuniya's future prospects by helping her to learn more about running a

Tomasa will buy mayonnaise, vegetables, tomatoes, onions, pickled chilies, cheese, cold cuts and bread rolls.  \r\n\r\nMargarita, 41, lives in a common law relationship and has four children: two boys and two girls.  One of the girls is in high school and the other is in middle school.  She sells candy, soft-drinks, tortas [Mexican style sandwiches], chicharrones preparados [fried pork rinds], popsicles, shoes, perfume and cosmetics via catalogue.  She started the business three years ago.  It was passed down to her from her father-in-law and her son taught her about sales.  She also sells shoes in rotating credit plans and also goes out to sell door to door among her neighbors and acquaintances.  \r\n\r\nHer business is important because it produces income with which to repay the loan and to cover school costs for her daughters.

M. is a member of the interim credit group <i>\"Las Flores de Mar\u00eda\"<\/i> (Mary's Flowers), and lives in San Mart\u00edn in the Morales district. She dedicates herself to selling eggs, and also runs a business selling goods that her customers request, like detergent, bleach, toilet paper, ground coffee and charcoal.  She runs her store out of her home in the San Mart\u00edn neighborhood. Her daily customers are also her neighbors from the area. <p>\r\n\r\nShe told us that she began selling undergarments, but due to her lack of experience, it didn't go very well. As she is optimistic and persevering, though, she decided to change her business, thanks to her mother's push, encouraging her to try something new, as well as her need to generate some income to cover the household expenses and her children's education. She saw that her neighborhood lacked general stores, and since she didn't have a better plan, she started up her business and began to run it a little at a time. <p>\r\n\r\nWith this loan for $275 that will be repaid in four monthly payments, she will buy cartons of eggs and other products that she needs, including bleach, detergent, toilet paper, charcoal, and whole bean coffee to roast and grind which will then be sold to her customers. This product in particular sells well since most vendors sell ground coffee that's been prepared chemically and put in envelopes. <p>\r\n\r\nShe is 27 years old and has three children, who are her inspiration to keep moving forward and to fight for her goals. She demonstrates assuredness and self-confidence as her customer base continues to increase, and by taking to heart their suggestions she is able to expand her business little by little as its manager. One of her goals for the near future is to expand and stock her store such that her customers are able to find everything they need. <p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Translated from Spanish by Shannon Skoglund, Kiva volunteer. <\/b><p>\r\n\r\nLa Se\u00f1ora Flor Marleni F.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.

Abdukayum is 42 years old. He is married with three children. Abdukayum is the sole breadwinner for his family and his only income comes from the raising and sale of large livestock at the local market. \r\n\r\nEvery year, he buys young heifers from the farms in adjacent villages. He raises them with the help of his wife and children and then sells the adult cows and bulls to local butchers. Today Abdukayum is thinking about expanding his business, since the income from his present herd isn't enough to provide for his family. He plans to purchase additional young cattle. To do this, he needs to invest an additional 4,000 Somoni (TJS) in his business. In order to receive this amount, Abdukayum has applied for a loan from Kiva's partner organization, IMON International.  \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International:\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

In spite of the inconveniences of being a single mother, she is happy to have her son Smith, who is 4 years old.  He is her reason for living.  They both live in a rented house located in the Peruvian jungle (in the town of Cahuide).  Since she was a young girl she has grown coffee.  Her parents taught her how to cultivate it and care for it.  With time, she learned to save in order to purchase a piece of land to farm.  She started growing bananas and sold them to a merchant in her same region and now, she travels to the central market in the city to sell her coffee.  Miriam has no one to help her, but this doesn't discourage her.  On the contrary, it gives her strength to strive to get ahead since she is sure that with hard work and optimism she will be able to provide for her son.  \r\n\r\nHer plans are to open a store that sells basic necessities to be able to help the residents of her town since there isn't one there and they are far from the city.  This prevents them from being able to purchase goods daily.  This is her third loan with MFP and she notes that since she has started working with her communal bank she has been able mark her progress.  For this reason she plans to integrate more with them.  She will use the 2000 nuevos soles (Peruvian currency) that she is requesting to buy 40 bags of fertilizer for the coffee that she is planting "}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":825,"image":{"id":609365,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To purchase 40 bags of fertilizer","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-10-03T14:20:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":825,"lender_count":29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Miriam ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-09-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2300,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":825,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-07T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":2300}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":825}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":714.84,"local_amount":1992.89,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T09:12:37Z","rounded_local_amount":1999.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221718171},{"amount":110.16,"local_amount":307.11,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-17T08:14:25Z","rounded_local_amount":308.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227350942}],"funded_date":"2010-10-03T17:45:55Z","paid_date":"2011-09-17T08:14:25Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":239478,"name":"Limber","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El Sr. Limber Vive en localidad de el Torno distante a 39 km de la ciudad de Santa Cruz, es nacido en la provincia florida, de los valles cruce\u00f1os, se dedica a la construcci\u00f3n de casas en la ciudad, es alba\u00f1il hace unos dos a\u00f1o, el destino del cr\u00e9dito es para comprar una motocicleta y realizar el servicio de transporte urbano, ya que su actividad en algunas \u00e9pocas es baja, por lo que alternara con esta nueva actividad, vive en la casa de su madre, su esposa se dedica a la agricultura, en la localidad de Guarayos, del departamento de Santa Cruz, no tienen hijo , pero su esposa tiene una peque\u00f1a de su antiguo esposo, ya que quedo viuda y reci\u00e9n est\u00e1n haciendo una vida juntos, el Sr. Limber es una persona muy Trabajadora, esta muy agradecido con la instituci\u00f3n por el apoyo brindado.\t","en":"Limber lives in the region of Torno, located at a distance of 39 kilometers from the city of Santa Cruz.

He and his wife have two school-age children. To earn a living, Roger owns and operates a business venture in the transportation services sector. Specifically, his primary source of income is derived from operating a motor-transport service. Roger has been engaged in his business for over four years and earns approximately 8,000 PHP per month from these activities. <p>\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Roger joined GDMPC to gain much-needed access to financial services. In turn, he was better able to engage in business activities and to thereby improve his family's standard of living. Recently, Roger successfully repaid a previous loan in the amount of 15,000 PHP from GDMPC.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She was selling candies in the Central Market in Lima for a while until she decided to become independent.  She decided to open up a candy store alone, becoming an unofficial distributor of many candy companies.  When she had enough money saved up, she opened up a small store in her home, 18 years ago.  Bit by bit, thanks to her and her husband\u2019s efforts, she has been able to sign an agreement with a big candy company so that she is an exclusive distributor of their brand of candy and snacks.  Now she has been working for them for 15 years and the business keeps growing.\r\n<p>\r\nIsabel and her husbad have 2 kids who are 19 and 12 years old.  They both work hard to keep progressing and find new markets in which to sell their products.  The shop that they have is a sign of the great effort that they have put in since they decided to start this business.\r\n\r\n<p> <b> Translated from Spanish by Liz Harvey, Kiva Volunteer <b\/.> <p>\r\n\r\n\r\nPara Isabel todo empez\u00f3 cuando aun era muy joven. Estuvo vendiendo dulces al por mayor en el mercado central de Lima durante una temporada hasta que decidi\u00f3 independizarse. Sola se animo a ofrecer de bodega en bodega golosinas, cumpliendo el papel de distribuidora no oficial de las empresas de golosinas. Una vez que tuvo ahorrado un dinero abri\u00f3 una tienda de dulces en su casa hace dieciocho. Poco a poco y gracias a su esfuerzo y al de su esposo, ha podido conseguir un acuerdo con una empresa de golosinas para ser los distribuidores exclusivos de una marca de dulces y snacks.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future\n\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":237365,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Shoe Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To purchase more shoes to sell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Kyela","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-9.583333 33.85","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-12-30T00:40:11Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Oliver F.

With his many years of construction experience, he decided to become his own boss two years ago.\r\n\r\nWith his loan from ACCION USA, Eloy will purchase two jackhammers and other equipment for demolition work. He has found ACCION USA's financial education program very beneficial as it has provided helpful information and great support.\r\n\r\nEloy dreams of being able to grow his business and employing others. By doing this he will be helping not only his family, but his workers' families as well, he says.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b> About U.S. Microfinance and ACCION USA:<\/b>\r\nHave you ever thought about how the cute new caf\u00e9 on your corner or the salon you frequent every month got the financial resources to start their business? Chances are, they drummed up support from their friends and family, dipped into their personal savings, used a high-interest credit card, or all of the above. An estimated ten million small businesses in the U.S. face difficulty obtaining loans from traditional banks, even prior to the current \u201ccredit crisis\u201d. Microfinance institutions, like ACCION USA, support these \u201cunbanked\u201d small businesses by giving them access to fairly-priced capital and business education.\r\n\r\nSmall businesses also help stabilize low- to moderate-income neighborhoods and rebuild our economy through income growth and job creation. Self-employment provides workers with a way to increase their incomes, support their families, and strengthen their communities. As unemployment rises in the U.S., more and more people are turning to self-employment and start-up enterprises as a way to take control of their economic futures and provide employment opportunities in their communities. The need for support of small businesses in the U.S. is great, and it is one that ACCION USA has been striving to meet since 1991.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2275,"image":{"id":482172,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Construction

She is very well known in the market and has a good reputation. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":619927,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":["Conflict Zones"],"use":"Purchase of pots, plates and glasses","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CG","country":"Congo (Rep.)","town":"Brazzaville","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-1 15","type":"point"}},"partner_id":165,"posted_date":"2010-10-17T12:40:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Paulette","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-10-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XAF","disbursal_amount":250000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":14300},{"due_date":"2010-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":14500},{"due_date":"2010-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":14700},{"due_date":"2010-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":14800},{"due_date":"2010-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2010-11-29T08:00:00Z","amount":15200},{"due_date":"2010-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":15300},{"due_date":"2010-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":15500},{"due_date":"2010-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":15700},{"due_date":"2010-12-27T08:00:00Z","amount":15900},{"due_date":"2011-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":16100},{"due_date":"2011-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":16200},{"due_date":"2011-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":16400},{"due_date":"2011-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":16600},{"due_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","amount":16800},{"due_date":"2011-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":17000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.46},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.9},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.34},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.56},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.44},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.66},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.1},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.54},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.98},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.42},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.64},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.08},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.52},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.96},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.4}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":31.46,"local_amount":14300,"processed_date":"2010-10-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T14:46:40Z","rounded_local_amount":14709.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177433231},{"amount":163.24,"local_amount":74200,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T14:29:59Z","rounded_local_amount":76324.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182572728},{"amount":137.28,"local_amount":62400,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T13:24:37Z","rounded_local_amount":64186.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188708573},{"amount":180.62,"local_amount":82100,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T04:02:25Z","rounded_local_amount":84450.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191446544},{"amount":37.4,"local_amount":17000,"processed_date":"2011-02-07T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:55:10Z","rounded_local_amount":17486.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195868144}],"funded_date":"2010-10-17T13:57:50Z","paid_date":"2011-03-15T11:55:10Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Alison Le Bras","image":608879}},{"id":243592,"name":"Segundo Manuel","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Segundo Manuel C.

Manuel lives in his own home with with his wife, his daughter and son-in-law, and two grandchildren.  \r\n\r\nAgriculture has been, and will be, the activity that keeps him and his family, and over the course of all these years he has learned the agriculture business.  He grows potatoes of the \"de color\" and \"\u00fanica\" varieties on the parcels of land on his property, as these are the types that are most requested.  He also grows peas of the \"super mejorada\", \"otrillo\" and \"rondo\" varieties.  \r\n\r\nWorking in the fields signifies more to Manuel than just a means of sustenance.  It is a recreation, an art, a dedication.  His plants are tended with love.  He brings the same approach to his work buying and selling cattle, both bulls and cows.  He puts the cattle to pasture and fattens them up, obtaining earnings of about 200 soles per head.  At the same time, he sells the milk produced by his cows for either direct consumption, or for making cheese and other things.\r\n\r\nManuel sees himself working in agriculture until the end of his days.  He wants to expand his farming lands and generate more earnings.  \"Here I was born, and here I will die\", he tells us between laughs.  \r\n\r\nWith your help, Manuel will receive his 13th loan with MFP, and so he agrees to be punctual with his repayments.  \u201cSanto Domingo de Tapo\u201d is the name of his communal bank, in which he feels trust and confidence.  He will invest the money from his loan in purchasing pea seeds and farmyard manure.  He has allocated 370 soles for each 25 kilo bag.  The remaining money will be used to pay for labor for sowing, tending and harvesting his land.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":919119,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy pea seeds, sacks of manure and to hire workers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-11-18T03:30:15Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":750,"lender_count":26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Manuel ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-29T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-29T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":750}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":750,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-16T08:34:42Z","rounded_local_amount":2028,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287097916}],"funded_date":"2011-11-19T03:42:59Z","paid_date":"2012-07-16T08:34:42Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Arabella Pollack","image":null}},{"id":362463,"name":"Las Vecinas (Cuenca) Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El banco comunal Las Vecinas, est\u00e1 formado por 8 socias y 1 socio quienes trabajan en diferentes actividades, las mismas que le permiten solventar los gastos del hogar y as\u00ed salir adelante con su familia.

Reyneria's job is selling food. She goes out early in the morning to the market seeking fruit and vegetables to be able to have the best for her faithful customers. They go to her locale seeking the varied and delicious and innovative dishes she makes. She only sells juices and some sandwiches in the morning and at 10 she begins to sell from the menu. She does all her work at her house where she set up some tables and chairs to receive customers. In addition, she also sells soft drinks. She does all the work herself, since her husband works at other activities. It is going very well for her. She makes a good percentage of what she invests and she feels that the effort she made at the beginning just to get her investment back is getting results now. She has customers that she earned during those 15 years that she has been doing this job. Now she is preparing to improve her infrastructure and make things more comfortable for her customers.

B. lives in the Abdurahmon Jomi region.  He is 46 years old, is married and has 6 children.  Mahmadrajab has a college education and is a veterinarian by profession.  He raises livestock.  Mahmadrajab purchases calves, fattens them for 40-45 days and then resells them at a higher price when they are worth more and are used for meat.  He then purchases new calves and repeats the process.  This is his business model.  This business helps to support his family as Mahmadrajab is the sole earner in his family. <p>\r\n\r\nThe expansion of the livestock sector allows for the provision of markets with quality meat at affordable prices.  Mahmadrajab has been in the livestock business for 22 years and will use this loan to purchase more calves.  He will pay back the loan over a 12 month period.  \r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Russian by Sabina Holzman, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u0411\u043e\u0431\u0438\u0435\u0432

This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic services for women with low incomes.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Because they don't have Dominican documentation and don't speak the language well, their employment opportunities are limited, so they start their own businesses.\r\n\r\nMilagros sells different food items at her house.

She will use this loan to be well stocked in these products in order to meet the demands of her clientele.\r\n\r\nOne of Milagros' biggest challenges is collecting payments from the customers she sells to on credit.

Babayor is 57 years old and is married with two children. For more than thirteen years Babayor has been selling vegetables such as potatoes, onions, carrots, etc. His elder son helps him with the business.\r\n\r\nBabayor\u2019s business begins in the early morning at 5:00 a.m. He buys vegetables from the local farmers at wholesale and sells them in the market. Moreover, he is trading in a market that is known among people because of its attractive prices. All this allows Babayor\u2019s business to generate a stable and considerable income for his family.\r\n\r\nToday, Babayor is planning to purchase new, fresh vegetables to sell in order to increase the range of his produce. For this purpose he requests 4,000 Somoni. Having a positive credit history with IMON, Babayor promises to repay the current loan promptly as he did the previous loans. The well-being of his family is in your hands.\r\n\r\n<b>More about Tajikistan and IMON International<\/b>\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

His family lives in Korolyovo. Ivan sells household cleaning products and personal products in the central marketplace of his small hometown. Small ventures like Ivan\u2019s become the only source of income for families in remote parts of Ukraine. Ivan has been in the trade for 8 years. Currently, his inventory amounts to 40,000 Grivnas; his income is about 5,000 Grivnas a month. \r\n\r\nIvan\u2019s business is characterized by stability and positive performance.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture, and Central Asian traditions. Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She started the business 15 years ago to help her family meet its education expenses, as well as water, electricity and food expenses. All of these items are very expensive. \r\n\r\nNow, Nenita has requested 20,000 PHP as additional working capital for her business. She is positive that her business will grow, since she already has regular customers in her local area submitting orders. Specifically, the loan will be used to buy more ingredients. She is pleased because, in the past, she has used the loans to invest in her business.\r\n\r\nWith working capital, Nenita's business will continue to grow and she will be able to provide excellent products to her regular customers. With the support of Kiva lenders, Nenita hopes to improve the standard of living for herself and her family and lift them out of poverty. \r\n\r\nShe dreams of having a permanent space in the marketplace where she can sell her food in order to earn a much larger income. She also dreams of her children completing college. Nenita is glad to ASHI for offering her happiness in life and group support in achieving her goals.\r\n\r\nDuring the course of her membership in ASHI, Nenita has been a model member, dedicated to managing her family\u2019s operations.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":672398,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

Her family resides in Caloocan City.\r\n\r\nMichelle buys and sells clothes in the Ready To Wear (RTW) business. She sells clothes like shirts and pants to her business connections and friends. Also, Michelle sees a future in selling peanut butter, which she makes herself. This business is a hit primarily because Michelle gets the taste that favors the appetites of her customers. Monthly, Michelle is able to earn an estimated net income of around Php10,500.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue the operation of her business, she requests a Php15,000 loan. She will add this loan to the money she currently has in order to purchase more clothes and accessories, as well as ingredients for peanut butter, sugar and peanuts.\r\n\r\nShe recognizes that exhaustion keeps her down and becomes her major struggle, but she is determined to overcome the tiredness mentality, get enough rest everyday, and grow her business. She sees her business as a way to help her family and her community. Her hope is to give her children a bright future, and one step toward that is to be able to send them to school, up to college.\r\n\t\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.
