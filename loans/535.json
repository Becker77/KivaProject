She is 44 years old. Wilma is married and has four adult children. To make a living, Wilma owns & operates a general store selling a variety of different products in the local community. Wilma has been engaged in her business for over three years and earns approximately 5,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Wilma joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Wilma has successfully repaid a previous loan of 6,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to purchase new items to expand her product offering. Wilma is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional inventory & working capital. This loan will be the sixth loan taken out by Wilma from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her  family. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

His business was first owned by a family member and Albert and his sister were employed there until the owner of this small business decided to pursue other activities in which he had more experience and gave Albert and his sister first bids on buying the place.  So far they have managed to pull it off, but they want to grow the business. This is precisely Albert's goal now because he needs to buy a machine for adding decorative glasses to his business.  The glasses double as gifts and can also be sold to other businesses.  Albert projected that this will be a successful investment so they have already reviewed this alternative in the market and their customers like the idea; plus there is no nearby competition. \r\n\r\nAlbert's dream is to achieve recognition in the city and turn his business into a house event, advance professionally and to have a family that he can offer opportunities to succeed.

In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, where groceries, toiletries and beverages are sold piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, five Philippine pesos' (PHP) worth of cooking oil, or an egg. \r\n\r\nMary Ann earns money by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. She also earns money through an electronic cellular phone loading station. What she does is to buy electronic cellular phone loads (minutes) in bulk, then resell them at retail. Her profit depends on the network's dealership policy. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 610 PHP in sales every day. \r\n\r\nTo help her continue operating her business, she is requesting a 19,000 PHP loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She will also invest some of the loan to buy electronic loads from different local networks. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nMary Ann hopes to be able to expand soon, just as she hopes to support her sister up to college level. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week, where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies. \r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

He currently handles lines of merchandise directed to young people, Christian stores and national distributors, he\u2019s also built up a market at the university he attends as well as in his neighborhood because it\u2019s common for the young people to wear scapulars and rosaries and it\u2019s also customary for housewives to give away souvenirs at their parties like religious prints, buttons, etc.\r\n\r\nHis main challenge right now is insufficient working capital which keeps him from expanding and this is why he\u2019s calling on a Kiva loan, his first financing from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, to buy materials like resinated products, leather, hooks and hoops to make crafts because he has an important pending order and he must buy in quantity and pay cash to receive a good discount and be able to keep his commitment to his new customer to win him over and make him a regular, repeat customer.  His goal for later on is to finish getting his Law degree and help his family with his business.  While this occurs, Carlos works with one employee that he pays daily.  He has no competition in his sector and is handling a contribution margin of 44.22% and a profit margin on sales averaging 28.36%.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":824337,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"to buy crafts making supplies.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Corregimiento la Playa-Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2011-08-02T17:30:15Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":575,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Carlos Andres","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-07-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":70437},{"due_date":"2011-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":76259},{"due_date":"2011-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":77721},{"due_date":"2011-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":79211},{"due_date":"2012-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":80729},{"due_date":"2012-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":82276},{"due_date":"2012-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":83853},{"due_date":"2012-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":85460},{"due_date":"2012-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":87098},{"due_date":"2012-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":88768},{"due_date":"2012-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":90469},{"due_date":"2012-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":97719}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.5},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.85},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.69},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.55},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.42},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.3},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.22},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.14},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.08},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.04},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.02},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.19}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":40.5,"local_amount":70437,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:07:12Z","rounded_local_amount":71363.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232803666},{"amount":43.85,"local_amount":76259,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:18:19Z","rounded_local_amount":77261.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238614747},{"amount":44.69,"local_amount":77721,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-24T08:51:54Z","rounded_local_amount":78743.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244568701},{"amount":45.55,"local_amount":79211,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:07:10Z","rounded_local_amount":80252.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250780034},{"amount":46.42,"local_amount":80729,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T10:21:49Z","rounded_local_amount":81790.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257188430},{"amount":95.52,"local_amount":166129,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:36:10Z","rounded_local_amount":168313.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263324649},{"amount":258.47,"local_amount":449514,"processed_date":"2012-04-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:41:59Z","rounded_local_amount":455425.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276650866}],"funded_date":"2011-08-03T15:40:37Z","paid_date":"2012-05-15T09:41:59Z","journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":325971,"name":"Moses","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Moses is 42 years old and married with three children.

She lives with her husband and their children in the town of Sikasso (3rd administrative region of the Republic of Mali). Anta started trading in clothing 20 years ago, after several failed business ventures. She sells clothes in her local district and surrounding towns, and is much in demand due to the high quality of her products. She decided to join the Soro Yiriwaso microfinance institution about a year ago in order to be able to satisfy increasing customer demand. She is now requesting a second loan from the institution, having fully repaid the previous one. She will use the money to buy 15 Pagnes Wax (traditional, sarong-like clothing) and 5 suits of embroidered fabric. She normally buys her merchandise in the town of Bobo Dioulasso (in Burkina Faso), before getting it tailored and ready for resale. She sells the clothes for cash or credit to a mixed clientele of men and women.\r\n\r\nAnta thinks she will achieve a monthly profit of around 100 000 FCFA, which will mainly be used to increase her business, contribute to her family's expenses and pay off the interest on her loan.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":875949,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing","sector":"Clothing","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"to buy Wax pagnes and embroidered fabrics.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sikasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.316667 -5.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2011-10-01T13:50:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Anta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-09-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":200000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2011-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2011-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2012-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2012-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2012-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2012-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2012-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2012-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2012-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":20000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2011-10-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T11:23:05Z","rounded_local_amount":20476.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238699258},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2011-11-07T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T11:12:18Z","rounded_local_amount":20476.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244655528},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2011-12-07T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T11:22:43Z","rounded_local_amount":20476.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250874318},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2012-01-07T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:47:57Z","rounded_local_amount":20476.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257283141},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2012-02-07T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T11:00:38Z","rounded_local_amount":20476.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263424652},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2012-03-07T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-11T08:19:49Z","rounded_local_amount":20476.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270139912},{"amount":170,"local_amount":80000,"processed_date":"2012-04-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-22T08:39:01Z","rounded_local_amount":81904.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276756917}],"funded_date":"2011-10-01T21:14:35Z","paid_date":"2012-05-22T08:39:01Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":342380,"name":"Eternel Plus Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mudilawe is the leader of the \u201cEternel Plus\u201d group consisting of up of 10 members.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b><br>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He is separated and his children live with his ex-wife.  Isa\u00edas has driven a taxi for 25 years.  He works from eight at night until eight in the morning in a rented car (a car he pays for from his earnings).  \r\n\r\nIsa\u00edas has started his life anew and has a new wife who is very supportive.  This is why, in addition to working to support his children, he is also starting to think about his future with his new partner.  Working at night is dangerous and Isa\u00edas suffered serious injuries in an attack one time.  Happily, he recovered and continues to work toward his goals.  He reports that he is not a coward and will take his passengers wherever they need to go, even if it is a dangerous area.

\u2013 Kupang District of East Nusa Tenggara Province. Bone Village is situated about one and a half hours' drive from Kupang City. Most of the community living in Bone Village have a background as farmers who always lean on agricultural products for supporting their family. Only a small number of the community lean on husbandry for meeting their family needs as it needs a big capital.<P>\r\n\r\nThis group is part of a larger group of 15 cattle farmers. Due to recent devaluation of the Indonesian Rupiah, the group had to be split into 2 smaller groups to keep the loan size within the limit of $5,000 per group loan. Due to the remote location of the village, the partner was not able to re-visit the group for new pictures and an interview with a second group leader.  The original photo has been split in half and the group leader mentioned is in the second sub-group currently fundraising on Kiva.<P>\r\n\r\nThe community in Bone village usually consumes corn and cassava as their main food. They sell agricultural products such as bananas and coconuts in Inpres Market, which is situated about 37 km from Bone Village. The challenge for the community in this village is the availability of public transport to help them reach the market. The public transport only operates on Monday, Wednesday and Saturday and there is no local market available in this village so it is quite difficult for the community to sell their agricultural products.<P>\r\n\r\nKuanputun A is led by a 34-year-old farmer \u2013 Simson N.. Simson was born and grew up in Bone Village. He is a married man with 3 children. They are Dian N. 6 years old - in the first grade of Elementary School, Andhika N. 3 years old, and Alfian N., 1 year old.<P>\r\n\r\nAs a farmer, Simson spends his days cultivating the farm. He plants peanuts, cassava, vegetables, coconuts and bananas on the farm. His family always relies on the agricultural products in meeting their daily needs. Simson\u2019s wife also helps Simson by selling their agricultural produce but they only generate a meager income so Simson has difficulty covering the children\u2019s education fees and their daily needs.<P>\r\n\r\nJust the same as the other community where the people have difficulty selling their agricultural products because of lacking transportation, Simson also faces the same problem. This difficulty has driven Simson to find another way to support his family. <P>\r\n\r\nThe Cattle Fattening program becomes a preference for Simson to support his family, as it will benefit him after fattening the cattle for a certain period. Simson and the neighbors were really excited when they heard about the TLM cattle fattening program. Simson and his neighbors then decided to form a group to receive a loan so they can buy young cattle to be fattened. They are really interested in joining this program because the price of cattle is quite expensive in the market. They are sure the profits that will be generated from this program will help them cover the family's daily needs. They hope the loan will help them to improve their living standard and provide a bright future for their children.<P>\r\n\r\n\r\nNote: Yesaya and Matias were replaced by their family members when the group picture was taken.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2725,"image":{"id":357299,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy cattle to be fattened","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Bone","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":129,"posted_date":"2009-07-22T20:30:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2725,"lender_count":80,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Matias","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yesaya","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kornelis","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yermias","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kornalia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Petrus","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Petronela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nahor","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":false}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-07-03T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"IDR","disbursal_amount":27200000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":2725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":27200000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2725}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":2725,"local_amount":27200000,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-26T08:02:53Z","rounded_local_amount":27400935.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":124001207}],"funded_date":"2009-07-24T00:51:37Z","paid_date":"2010-03-26T08:02:53Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":128450,"name":"Ameir Mohammad Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ameir M. is the leader of the Ameir M.

This amount will be used as a source of added capital to her expanding business, buying more products to be sold at her hardware store to replenish her current product stock.\r\n\r\nShe dreams that her business will continue to grow so that she can provide for her children\u2019s education.\r\n\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay Micro Finance loans.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":536076,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"buying more fruits to be incorporated into her current product inventory","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"GMA, Cavite","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2010-05-06T15:30:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":525,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Leliosa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-04-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":23000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-27T07:00:00Z","amount":958.33},{"due_date":"2010-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":958.33},{"due_date":"2010-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":958.33},{"due_date":"2010-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":958.33},{"due_date":"2010-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":958.33},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":958.33},{"due_date":"2010-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":958.33},{"due_date":"2010-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":958.33},{"due_date":"2010-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":958.33},{"due_date":"2010-06-29T07:00:00Z","amount":958.33},{"due_date":"2010-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":958.33},{"due_date":"2010-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":958.33},{"due_date":"2010-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":958.33},{"due_date":"2010-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":958.33},{"due_date":"2010-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":958.33},{"due_date":"2010-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":958.33},{"due_date":"2010-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":958.33},{"due_date":"2010-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":958.33},{"due_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","amount":958.33},{"due_date":"2010-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":958.33},{"due_date":"2010-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":958.33},{"due_date":"2010-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":958.33},{"due_date":"2010-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":958.33},{"due_date":"2010-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":958.41}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.87},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.88},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.87},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.88},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.87},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.88},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.87},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.88},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.87},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.88},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.87},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.88},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.87},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.88},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.87},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.88},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.87},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.88},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.87},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.88},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.87},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.88},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.87},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.88}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":109.37,"local_amount":4791.65,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:00:05Z","rounded_local_amount":4899.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144684726},{"amount":109.38,"local_amount":4791.85,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-16T07:35:54Z","rounded_local_amount":4900.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":152028626},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":3833.12,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T10:43:28Z","rounded_local_amount":3919.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159608045},{"amount":109.37,"local_amount":4791.65,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T09:56:57Z","rounded_local_amount":4899.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166821556},{"amount":109.38,"local_amount":4791.73,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T09:53:04Z","rounded_local_amount":4900.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172088825}],"funded_date":"2010-05-11T02:41:04Z","paid_date":"2010-10-15T09:53:04Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":203052,"name":"Toir","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Toir is a 54 year old, married father of 5 children.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is 31 years old. Cristina is the group leader of a four-member group loan offered by ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nCristina is married and has three school-aged children. To make a living, Cristina runs a general store, selling both food and daily-use products in the local community. Cristina has been engaged in her business for over 10 years and earns approximately 3,500 Philippine pesos (PHP) a month from it.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Cristina joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Cristina has successfully repaid a previous loan of 7,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Cristina is requesting a new loan of 8,000 PHP, which will also be used to purchase additional products to sell. This will be the third loan taken out by Cristina from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand it. \r\n\r\n<b>About ASKI:<\/b>\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 29 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Instead they are already used to working at a very young age and their education has been set aside. Since they are elementary graduates, job opportunities are very few for them; they find difficulty in seeking a job. \r\n\r\nGeraldine now realizes the importance of education and that is why they are really striving in order to earn an income and savings for the future of their children.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, she joined ASHI because she believes that this institution could help them realize their dreams. She maintains her good performance in ASHI because she wants to access more capital so that she will also have a bigger income.\r\n\r\nShe is requesting Php 9,000 for her second loan. This amount will be utilized as additional capital for her business buying and selling fruit and dried fish. The income that they will get from this business is a great help to the family to cover their basic needs.\r\n\r\nFinally, Geraldine is very thankful to ASHI and to those people who give her opportunities despite her educational problems and living conditions. According to her, she will do her best in order to improve her business so that the funders and the institution will not regret putting their trust in her.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":629872,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits &

She is 54 years old. Rosita is married and has two adult children. To make a living, Rosita owns and operates a business raising crops. The main source of income for the business comes from planting and harvesting corn to sell. Rosita has been engaged in her business for over 20 years and earns approximately 8,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Rosita joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Rosita has successfully repaid a previous loan of 20,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase fertilizers, such as manure. Rosita is requesting a new loan of 25,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional seeds, seedlings, and young crops to raise. This loan will be the eighth loan taken out by Rosita from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand it. \r\n<p>\r\n<b>About ASKI:<\/b><br>\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines.

She is 39 years old and a group member with PMPC. Avelina is married and has three children, two of whom are students while the eldest is in Manila. To make a living, Avelina operates a business of selling vegetable snacks in the local community. Avelina has been engaged in her business for over two years and earns approximately $88 a month for these activities. \r\n\r\nIn 2008, Avelina joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. She is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP which will be used as additional capital. This will be her 7th loan from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to financially support immediate members of her family.\r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

T. is 29 years old and makes his own traditional handicrafts.  He weaves hammocks and bags in different styles based on what customers see in magazines which he also uses for marketing purposes.  Based on family tradition, Edgar began his business in 2004 when he studied agricultural business administration.  He was unable to find a job and decided to use his entrepreneurial and artistic skills and aptitude.\r\n\r\nHe has received two loans through the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation, including his crediKiva, which he will use to purchase materials to make hammocks and bags.  The investment is bound to be successful because already has taken orders from customers.  Because of his lack of capital, Edgar usually does not keep an inventory of products so he must supply orders by paying a higher price for materials which means less profit.\r\n\r\nSince receiving his first loan through the Foundation he has been able to increase his earnings and buy a machine to make the bags.  Before he was able to do this he had to go to family members for capital.  Now he is more independent.\r\n\r\nEdgar lives in San Jacinto, in the department of Bolivar.  His wife is also an artisan and she is his greatest support.  Together they are building their dream of having a large shop along the main road west of town where the crafts sector is located."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":729711,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"To

In the future, Rina plans to uplift the economic condition of her family. She thanks you for your support. \r\n\r\nNepal has a long and rich history of traditional handicrafts. Throughout the Kathmandu Valley, skilled artisans produce unique pieces of art that reflect Nepal's cultural diversity. Terra cotta pottery comes from the red clay of the surrounding Himalayan foothills. Bronze and silver statuettes are formed using wax molds and intricate hand tool finishing. In Patan, Newari culture and traditions are reflected in the images and symbols etched into metal or formed in stone. With the help of a Kiva loan, Nepal's artisans are able to purchase raw materials in greater volume. This increase in volume allows a single artisan to work on several pieces at the same time while increasing her profit margin.

There she has a business selling jewelry made of crystal and silver.  In addition, Marve sells lingerie.  Her primary customer base is composed of local teachers to whom she offers financing and monthly installment plans.  She asks for a down payment of 20%.  Marve has five years of experience and started this commercial venture as a way to help manage her household.  Her husband is self-employed and assumes responsibility for all of the expenses.  Marve earns additional income working for the Colombian Institute of Social Welfare in the \u201cCommunity Mothers\u201d Program that was started by groups of women in the 1970s.  This initiative was started in order to look after children living in crowded neighborhoods by seeking child support from their absent fathers and mothers who have left to find work.  The Colombian Institute of Family Welfare (ICBF) took advantage of this initiative and started its own program with the strategy of providing low-cost child care to the poorest families.  Caretakers who look after these children in their own homes receive grant money for their work.  \r\n\r\nMarve Luz enjoys her job and has two young daughters who she dreams of seeing become successful professionals.  They serve as her motivation, so she is committed to growing her business in order to see her dream come true.  Her customer base has grown tremendously as a result of the loans she has received from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  This Kiva loan is her third instance of financing with the organization.  She will use the money to buy new designs of silver accessories that are in style and have been ordered.  In her business, Marve Luz is able to maintain a profitability rate of no less than 35% and an inventory turnover period of no more than 60 days so that she can recoup her investment.  Her Kiva loan will help her continue growing because her operating capital at the moment is insufficient in helping her respond to new customers.

entrepreneur.  He is 27 years old.  He lives with his brother and his mom who is retired.  His brother is currently making a living in the Russian Federation.  Javlon himself works as a taxi driver.

Tomas and his wife Hortencia have lived on these lands for over 30 years. There they have raised three children who are all on their own now. Tomas is seeking to receive a loan so that hey may invest in rice farming. The rainy season is just coming to an end and this is a particularly good time to plant the rice seeds and prepare the lands. The loan will help Tomas avoid borrowing from the loan sharks common to the area. Although he knows they charge exuberant interest rates, Tomas has been forced to borrow from these lenders several times due to his shortage of capital.  <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>He is the latest addition to the first Communal Bank in the new Mifex Rural Finance Program.  All of the members of the Resistencia Communal Bank are part of an Association of Rice Farmers in Salitre named Resistencia. They will use the microloans to prepare the lands and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each others guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the Resistencia Association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many microfinance programs, but is imperative for the communities Mifex works with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties.<\/p>\r\n\r\n \r\n<h4>Loan Use and Repayment<\/h4>\r\n<p>The loans in this sector will be used to create water deposits that will prevent flooding in the case of heavy rains or store water in case of droughts. They will also be used to treat the land prior to farming,  to plant the seeds and purchase fertilizer. The loan repayment schedule is also different from the typical microentrepreneur. Because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures, Mifex asks them only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 6 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the seventh and final month. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Below is more information about Salitre compiled by the staff at Mifex when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. <\/em><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>Economy of Salitre<\/h4>\r\n<p>Salitre is a rural sector in the Province of Guayas known as the capital of Montuvios (montuvio is a cowboy) with approximately 30,000 inhabitants. The main economic activities are herding and agriculture which make up about 80% of the economy. The infrastructure and basic services are poor,  especially the roads and water services.<\/p> \r\n  \r\n<p>Salitre is highly dedicated to farming rice and cattle ranching. Rice is a crop that yields about every four months. In order to farm rice, the environment must be very humid and there must be a high volume of water. The lack of a structured water system makes it difficult for the small farmers to be highly productive. The best months for cultivating rice are early in the year when it is the rainy season in the coast of Ecuador. <\/p> \r\n  \r\n<p>Salitre is a national tourist attraction as many Ecuadorians visit the fresh water Salitre River. There are cottages, small restaurants and water attractions that people come to enjoy.<\/p> \r\n  \r\n<h4>Access to Credit<\/h4>\r\n<p>There is not a single financial institution that provides services to the productive sector of the local economy. The only access to credit comes from loan sharks who charge extremely high interest rates averaging around 20% a month. The locals are also exploited by the intermediaries that buy their products in order to commercialize them in the city and to export abroad. These intermediaries buy crops in advance at very low prices, finance soil at extremely high prices and often provide emergency loans for even higher interest rates than the loan sharks.<\/p> \r\n  \r\n  \r\n<h4>Risks<\/h4> \r\n<p>Salitre is a dangerous sector considering it is in the rural area. There is a high incidence of robbery of cattle that results in many of the ranch owners owning weapons to protect their property. Because the police are not present in these areas, farmers and ranchers must apply their own laws and provide their own security. In some instances they have formed their own cooperatives and associations to have a community crime prevention effort.<\/p> \r\n  \r\n<p>Salitre is in the lowlands of Ecuador and is vulnerable to flooding in the rainy season. In the event of a heavy rainy season, often at its worse when El Ni\u00f1o occurs, the farmers of rice lose many of their crops. All this is due to a lack of infrastructure in the area.<\/p> \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":33385,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Farm Rice","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Salitre","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-1.833333 -79.8","type":"point"}},"partner_id":7,"posted_date":"2007-04-29T05:42:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1200,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Tomas","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-05-15T01:28:11Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1200,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":1200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":200}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":200}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-06-02T18:49:57Z","settlement_date":"2007-09-28T19:12:55Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":19620},{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-06-27T14:09:16Z","settlement_date":"2007-09-28T19:12:55Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":26610},{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-07-27T16:08:36Z","settlement_date":"2007-09-28T19:12:55Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36157},{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-08-28T23:32:15Z","settlement_date":"2007-09-28T19:12:55Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":47482},{"amount":816,"local_amount":816,"processed_date":"2007-09-27T16:23:59Z","settlement_date":"2007-09-28T19:12:55Z","rounded_local_amount":816,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":59575}],"funded_date":"2007-05-01T01:28:11Z","paid_date":"2007-09-27T16:23:59Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":13750,"name":"Rano","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rano is 34 years old.

These women create a village bank through which they receive assistance in terms of loans. The main goal is to give them the opportunity to carry out economic activities that enable them to live with dignity and contribute to a better quality of life in their homes. Lending to poor women creates a cascading effect that brings social and economic benefits to a whole family, and thus to the entire community. Moreover, the sense of belonging to a group gives these poor women committee members the energy and motivation to reach success.<p> \r\nIda R., member of the committee called \u201cRosa Blanca\u201d in Asuncion told her sister Gladys R. who lives in San Jose in Ciudad del Este about the program Fundacion Paraguaya offers. Gladys, excited with the idea, contacted her fiends and neighbors and told them about the committee. She shared with these women her desire to change their world for the better by working very hard. Ida\u2019s hopeful words stimulated optimism among these women and they decided to form a committee.<p>\r\nThe group includes 16 women from different neighborhoods in the city. Their businesses include: despensas, (grocery stores, a very profitable market in Paraguay, since we consider it a tradition to buy from a Despensa), confectionaries, sewing shops, as well as sales of natural medicines, clothing, bijouterie, and jewelry. Some of the women offer services such as housekeeping. <p>\r\n The money provided by the credit will be used for the purchase of products such as: clothing, fabrics, thread, elastic bands, sugar, oil, pasta, cereals, milk, sugar and natural medicines <p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2925,"image":{"id":154424,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Purchase of merchandise like clothing, fabrics, thread, elastic bands, sugar, oil, pasta, cereals, milk, sugar and natural medicines","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PY","country":"Paraguay","town":"Ciudad del Este","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-25.516667 -54.616667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":58,"posted_date":"2008-05-16T09:50:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2925,"lender_count":79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sonia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mirtha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Adriana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Matilde","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Blanca","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gregoria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Pablina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eliodora","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"America","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marcelina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elvira","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatima","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ema","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-06-04T14:43:19Z","disbursal_currency":"PYG","disbursal_amount":12300000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":2925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":4100000},{"due_date":"2008-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":4100000},{"due_date":"2008-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":4100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":975},{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":975},{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":975}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":975,"local_amount":4100000,"processed_date":"2008-06-21T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-21T09:33:50Z","rounded_local_amount":4124250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244838},{"amount":975,"local_amount":4100000,"processed_date":"2008-07-21T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-21T09:33:50Z","rounded_local_amount":4124250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":273248},{"amount":975,"local_amount":4100000,"processed_date":"2008-08-21T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-21T09:33:50Z","rounded_local_amount":4124250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":302606}],"funded_date":"2008-05-21T14:43:19Z","paid_date":"2008-08-21T09:10:04Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":50619,"name":"Burigul","description":{"languages":["ru"],"texts":{"ru":"<p>Burigul H. lives in the Vahdat region.

Khudoiberdi is 54 years old. He is married and has 6 children. He is a very hard-working man who has experienced a great deal throughout his life. For the past 9 years, he has dedicated himself to providing taxi services. Regardless, Khudoiberdi is not regretful and is instead very proud of being a taxi driver. It is work where he can be free and make good friends, seeing as he is very charismatic. He always has a smile at the ready, and manages to bring out the same from those who ride in his taxi. <P>\r\n\r\nHappily for Khudoiberdi, business is good. It allows him to live comfortably, and support all of his children with education. Currently his car needs thorough repair and with this purpose he wants to borrow 500 USD for a term of 12 months that he will spend purchasing spare parts. He sincerely thanks Kiva and all lenders who make this help possible.       \r\n<P>\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International<P>\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and with its famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She owns a business venture, planting & harvesting taro for sale.  Maria has 2 years of experience in this business.  Maria needs a loan of WST $1250 to purchase weed-killers such as Gramoxome.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 450 talas or US $188 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Maria joined SPBD.  This is her 2nd loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Maria's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Maria Selu T. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                         1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:            1.5 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:                2.3 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from manufacturing & selling bamboo items and also weaving mats for 'nipa' (palm frond) huts. She also sells them to local community members. Eudesa is just starting this business.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Eudesa joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Eudesa has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5000 PHP from GDMPC. This previous loan was used to to invest in expanding the business. Eudesa is requesting a new loan of 5000 PHP which will be used to purchase raw materials to manufacture additional products. This will be the second loan taken out by Eudesa from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three unit offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Her life may be poor yet, being blessed with a very loving and supportive husband and children, any trials and problems she encounters in her everyday life seemed to be easy to overcome. She inspires her family to be content with what they have at the present and to work hard for anything else they feel is important to have. Nally believes that everything she dreams of for herself and family will eventually come true. \r\n\r\n\r\nWith that approach, through her, her family enjoys the opportunity ASHI has given them. Loans she has been receiving have enabled them to start their own income generating activities. They were able to purchase a motorcycle and a second-hand sidecar for a tricycle (motorcycle with sidecar) which is for her husband\u2019s transportation business. Nally also has her own salt buying and selling business. Large volumes of salt are sold in the market and during the town\u2019s market day when may people and small entrepreneurs come from other municipalities to buy different commodities for personal consumption and business. Nally sells her salt wholesale.\r\n\r\nProceeds of Nally's and her husband\u2019s businesses are the sole source of income for their family. As parents, they are also supporting the needs of their two children who are 19 and 24. Once Nally has the capability to open a saving fund, she will be motivating her children to go back to college as they are just high school graduates. Nally is hopeful that their businesses will become stable and profitable with the support of loans she can access. Presently, Nally\u2019s two daughters are helping her in the business.

In the beginning, he worked at a private car wash, and later he was hired by a car-repair shop as a mechanical assist\u0430nt.  When he had earned the necessary start-up capital, he bought his first car \u2013 a used Ford Sierra. From this moment, he changed his job and became a private taxi driver.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Bakyt had a car accident, which was the fault of another driver. Bakyt got injured, and his car became unsuitable for his taxi business, so Bakyt sold it. Bakyt and his family met difficult times as he was the only breadwinner for his family and kids. \r\n\r\nAfter full recovery, he decided to go back into business and took a loan from the Bai Tushum Company to purchase a car. He bought a Volkswagen Golf produced in 1986. The loan was used for its initial purpose and repaid on time and without any delay. This car is the only means of income in the B. family, but its technical condition does not allow it to carry out safe passenger transportation. The car needs to be repaired.\r\n\r\nThat\u2019s why Bakyt applied for another loan, to repair his car so that he can continue to work as a taxi driver. Part of the new loan Bakyt wants to use to renovate the house where his family lives.\r\n\r\nIn the future, Bakyt wants to buy a good minivan with seven seats and continue to work as a taxi driver. Bakyt\u2019s family now lives in a small, old house. Bakyt dreams of buying a good, large house for his family, where they could have their own household.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1500,"image":{"id":569638,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Taxi","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"To

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to epic mountain passes, a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC, and communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language. Today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to offer poor and low-income clients a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

is from the county of Baba, a rice-growing region on the Ecuadorian coast. Antonio has lived in Baba since he was born there 70 years ago. He has a rice farm where he, his wife, Paula, and several of their children work together to harvest the product. He is very happy that he is still a leader in his family and that he can help them earn a living. He wants to invest in fertilizer and pesticides for the rice, products which will make his lands more productive. \r\n<p> <b> Translated from Spanish by Jennifer Day, Kiva Volunteer. <p><\/b>\r\n<p> Antonio es del canton Baba, un sector arrocero en la costa ecuatoriana.

El quiere invertir en fertilizante y pesticidas para el arroz, productos que le har\u00e1n mas productivas sus tierras y para que tenga mas rendimiento. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Communal Banking in Baba<\/h4> \r\n<p>This borrower is part of the newest Communal Bank in the recently developed Mifex Rural Finance Program. All of the members of the Rosa de Oro (Golden Rose) Communal Bank are part of an Association of Rice Farmers in the county of Baba in rural Ecuador. Their association works cooperatively to cultivate rice and commercialize the product after it has grown. As an association, Rosa de Oro helps the farmers by providing access to machinery, training services and government assistance. The farmers from Rosa de Oro are very close to each other and cooperate to help one another on their farms.  \r\n<\/p> \r\n<p>The members of Rosa de Oro will use the micro-loans to prepare their lands and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each others' guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the Rosa de Oro Association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many micro-finance programs, but Mifex believes that is imperative for the communities we works with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties. <\/p> \r\n<p><em>Below is more information about Baba compiled by Luis Crespo and Robert Edgar of the Mifex team when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. <\/em><\/p> \r\n<h4>Economy of Baba<\/h4> \r\n<p>The people of Baba have been organized since the days of Gran Colombia when Ecuador was yet to be a country. The area has always been popular because of the extremely productive lands that gave way to cultivation of cacao for decades. Now Baba is a county in the province of Los Rios in the coastal region of Ecuador. For most of the latter part of the 20th Century it was a cacao and banana producing sector. Most of the surrounding areas of Baba in Los Rios are owned by large mulitnational  \r\ncompanies such as Dole, but Baba is a sector characterized by the small and informal farms. <\/p>\r\n<p>Rice production has now turned into the main economic activity of the sector as about 80% of the people are rice farmers. Cacao is still very popular in the area, but because of the long cultivation cycle people prefer to invest in rice. The lands in Baba are very fertile though, and most farmers in the sector often grow other crops, such as plantains and soy beans  \r\nas secondary sources of income.  Many farmers also keep livestock as emergency sources of food and income, commonly resorting to selling a chicken or pig if they are in need of cash. <\/p> \r\n<h4>Rice Farming in Baba<\/h4> \r\n<p>Most of the people in the Baba area are small farmers. They produce about 80 sacks of rice per hectare of land. In order to farm they first must prepare the lands by removing weeds, plowing and leveling the lands. This is the most difficult part for the farmers in Baba, who often lack the necessary machinery to properly plow the lands for rice production. After appropriately preparing the lands, the farmers fill an area with water to form what is known as a paddy field, because rice is a very water intensive crop. The rice seeds are either dispersed freely (the process is known as boleo in Spanish) or hand sowed. Once the rice has grown, most farmers rent machinery that helps them gather their production. <\/p> \r\n<h4>Access to Credit<\/h4> \r\n<p>One of the biggest struggles in the area has been the lack of credit due to the absence of any type of financial institution. \r\nBecause people do not count on formal financial finance, they have turned to loan sharks for financing. They have been affected by expensive lines of credit that exceed 100% interest a year and can be as expensive as 240%. Intermediaries also exploit the farmers because of their outstanding debt. Farmers also lack skills and knowledge to commercialize their products and pay fair prices for their crops. <\/p> \r\n<h4>Risks<\/h4> \r\n<p>The largest risk in the sector is due to absence of watering systems. Although Baba is in the province \u201cLos Rios\u201d (the rivers) there is severe problem with access to water. The lack of infrastructure in the sector does not allow the small farmers to benefit from the presence of the many rivers in the area. If the winter season is too dry, it is likely that the lands will not be sufficiently fertile for rice production in the summer. On the other hand, if there is too much rain there are not any drainage systems to prevent flooding and the crops are often ruined. Generally speaking though, Baba is a very productive sector where the lands yield all types of crops including rice, cacao, corn, watermelons, plantains, and soy beans. <\/p> \r\n<h4>Loan Use<\/h4> \r\n<p>The loans in this sector will mostly be used to to buy soil, seeds, fertilizer and insecticides. Many clients will use the capital towards renting machinery and equipment necessary to effectively work and prepare the fields. Clients also typically use a part of the loan to buy livestock in order to raise and have as reserves. The loan repayment schedule is different from the typical micro-entrepreneur because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures. Mifex asks our rural clients only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 6 months of the loan.

They are enterprising, hard-working women dedicated to wide-spread activities, but that doesn't effect the good organization of the group. <p>\r\nCurrently, the women are in their seventh loan cycle in the Committee of Enterprising Women program and each member has a line of credit. The group started after some initial informational meetings in the home Ninfa V\u00e1zquez, who learned of the program from a cousin who's a member in another group. Thanks to the meetings, the women started to mobilize and soon they were able to form a group of 15, the minimum requisite number. Today they are ready for their eighth loan cycle. <p>\r\nAda A., president of the committee, says it was a little difficult to reach a consensus on how to divide the first loans among the members \u2014 there were always differing opinions. But as time went on their relationship strengthened, and today one of the characteristics of the group is the harmony and mutual respect they have for each other. She considers the group's success comes from the fact that each member must meet the objectives as an individual and as a group. <p>\r\nAmong the activities that these women participate in are: selling plants, selling crafts, a convenience store, a kiosk, selling clothes, and the majority are dedicated to selling \"chipas\" \u2014 a very popular traditional dish in Paraguay.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<P>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<P>\r\nIMON's History\r\n<P>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

In addition, it is a peaceful type of work that does not require her to exert herself too much, because her customers come to her house to get the tanks of gas, and at times she gets help from her sisters or her children. \r\n\r\nShe also sells soft drinks and beer, which are in the most demand on the weekends. \r\n\r\nIn the future, Rosa plans to remodel a part of her home in order to open a small store where she can sell her drinks and other foods. \r\n\r\nThis is Rosa's fifth loan with MFP [Microfinanzas Prisma] and she is sure that she will be very responsible about repaying it, since she wants to keep a good relationship with this lending field partner.

SPBD's loans are Maliemailatoelau's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Maliemailatoelau L. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                         1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:            1.4 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:                1.6 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.

They have two adult children.  Their oldest is married and their daughter moved to the capital to work and study in order to have a better future.  \r\n\r\nOwning farm lands helped her support her family through by growingf corn, peas, broad beans and vegetables in general.  Her husband fell into alcoholism and she had to work alone, although now she can count on unconditional help from her older brother and nephews, who value her work and help her out with caring for the crops.  She has also been able to hire field workers to help with production and harvesting.  Thus, she has become a merchant of her own production; she takes her products to the capital every Wednesday to sell a variety of fresh vegetables.\r\n\r\nBesides responsibility for her home, she started a small grocery selling business in a small store she set up in her home.  She hopes to increase her crop production so that she can afford to pay for her daughter\u2019s college education because her greatest wish is that her daughter becomes a professional.\r\n\r\nThis is her 9th loan with MFP and she expects to meet her goal.  Besides, she enjoys working in a communal group because all the members are responsible persons who wish to progress.\r\n\r\nShe will use the 2500 new soles requested to buy a sack of pea seed, two sacks of manure and will hire more field hands to help with the potato harvest; she will also buy stock inventory  items for her little store.\r\n    \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":875,"image":{"id":510178,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":" To buy pea seed and hire field workers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-03-21T00:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":875,"lender_count":32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Clarisa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":875,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":2500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":875}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":875,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:25:56Z","rounded_local_amount":2504.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172153919}],"funded_date":"2010-03-22T06:57:54Z","paid_date":"2010-10-15T10:25:56Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":190793,"name":"Ena Paola","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El Banco Comunal Familiar se re\u00fane en la localidad Colorado en el  cant\u00f3n Montecristi en la provincia de Manab\u00ed cerca al puerto Atunero Manta.\n\nLa se\u00f1ora Ena es socia desde hace 5 ciclos en la Fundaci\u00f3n Espoir, ella es una joven madre de un ni\u00f1o de dos meses, se dedica a la venta ropa por catalogo y tambi\u00e9n compra ropa en Per\u00fa y Guayaquil seg\u00fan el pedido que tenga, cont\u00f3  con el apoyo de su mam\u00e1 en el tiempo que estaba en los meses de gestaci\u00f3n  encarg\u00e1ndose del negocio, ahora lo tiene que hacer ella aunque se le dificulta por el hecho que su bebe a\u00fan peque\u00f1o.\n\n Nuestra socia nos comenta  que ha sido de gran ayuda el trabajar con los cr\u00e9ditos de la Fundaci\u00f3n, su negocio ha ido creciendo muy bien y por ahora no ha tenido ning\u00fan tipo de problema con los pagos, con este nuevo cr\u00e9dito viajara  a Guayaquil para adquirir pantalones, Camisas, blusas, faldas, ropa interior para toda la familia  y  surtir su negocio  pues ya tiene varios pedidos pendientes por entregar.\n\n","en":"The Familiar Communal Bank meets in the Colorado location.

","en":"Elsy E. Sol\u00f3rzano lives in the Woods of Barranquilla with her partner and their 4 children, ages 11 to 20.  She makes and sells women\u2019s shoes in different styles.  She started the business because of her need to generate income for her family.    7 years ago she was involved in another type of work that wasn\u2019t profitable.  That\u2019s when she began to look for alternatives to improve her family income and she decided on the shoe business.  Since she had no idea how to make shoes, she began to learn in a friend\u2019s business and since that time, she hasn\u2019t stopped working in it.  With a lot of perseverance she has been able to get ahead and stabilize her income.  This is the first loan that she will receive with the Mario Santo Domino Foundation and she plans to use it to buy basic materials and supplies for making shoes, such as imitation leather, and especially jeans fabric (denim) that is very much in style.  She has designed new lines that she will make and sell to her best customer, a large department store, and to many kiosks in the commercial area of the center of Barranquilla.\r\n\r\nThe best part of her work is that she offers a variety in her designs and she is always in the vanguard of fashion.  She is able to keep up the quality and fulfill her dream to educate her children with honorable work and a prosperous business.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Miriam Palacio, Kiva

She is married and has two children, aged 30 and 26.  \r\n\r\nIn 2007, she established her cow-raising business. Working seven days a week and three hours a day, she supports her family.  \r\n\r\nShe has already received and successfully repaid one loan from Patan BPW and used her most recent to buy a young, milk-giving cow.  \r\n\r\nIn the future, Saraswati plans to uplift the economic condition of her family. She thanks you for your support. \r\n\r\nDairy cows are an important source of nutrition and income in Nepal. Cows are never raised for beef, but for their milk from which curd (duy) and fresh cheese (paneer) are made.  \r\n\r\nJersey cows are the preferred breed for milking. On average, a dairy cow in Nepal will produce about 10 liters of milk each day. In the local market, a liter of milk sells for about $0.50. In addition to producing milk, cows provide dung that is used in home construction, as fuel for fires, and can be captured in methane storage tanks. The purchase of a dairy cow, made possible through a Kiva loan, is an investment that will repay itself many times over.  \r\n\r\nThis loan was administered by Kiva's local partner MFI (microfinance institution), Patan Business and Professional Women. Patan BPW became Kiva's first field partner in Nepal in 2007. Patan BPW operates throughout the Kathmandu Valley, offering microcredit and business-training programs to low-income women.\r\n\r\nIn addition to providing economic opportunity to their clients, Patan BPW seeks to empower Nepali women within the home and community.

northern Sierra Leone. This school was founded by the Sierra Leone Muslim Youth Cultural Organization in September of 2000 to promote education in the district. The school is staffed with 16 teachers and has an enrollment of 437 pupils. This will be the second loan that this group of teachers is accessing from SMT\/Kiva lenders. A previous Kiva lenders\u2019 loan has tremendously helped in improving the standard of living of these borrowers. \r\n\r\n\r\nSchool staff from this institution, like many other schools' staff within SMT\u2019s operational areas, come to SMT to apply for loans. With the help of these loans, they can accomplish certain tasks that they would otherwise not be able to accomplish with their mere salaries alone. But with the help of this loan, some can pay school fees for their children; others can use the loan to buy pieces of furniture, a plot of land, house-building materials, or invest in business. At the end of each month, these teachers can repay the loan out of their monthly salaries. The institution\u2019s bursar is directly responsible for deducting the repayment and pays SMT on their behalf.\r\n\r\nLansana S., 50, is the leader of this group of teachers and has been a teacher for 16 years. He was born in Koinadugu district. He is married with 12 children \u2013 five in primary school, three in secondary school, two in college and two adults. Lansana will invest his loan in his business by buying local produce like rice, palm-oil, etc. at wholesale, to add to his business.

The styles that she sells are very trendy and showy, which has caused her to have many customers, who give her enough orders. She sells in the street, traveling through the streets in the north cone of the city of Lima every day. What she likes most about her work is helping her customers choose the right pair of shoes. She has had this business for two years, and she finds that the most difficult part is having to walk all day in search of customers. In time, she wants to set up a store where she can serve her customers more peacefully. \r\n\r\nThis is her third loan with MFP. She knows that she has to make her payments on time, and she is sure she will be able to do it, just as she did with her first loans. In her communal bank she feels that she is doing good work and that they have much respect for the punctuality that she demonstrates. With the 600 PEN that she is applying for, she will buy more shoes, so that she has a greater variety to offer her customers.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":776459,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Shoe Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy more shoes to sell.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-05-25T02:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":225,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-05-05T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":600,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2011-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2011-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2011-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":150}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":56.25,"local_amount":150,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:33:11Z","rounded_local_amount":154.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216550365},{"amount":56.25,"local_amount":150,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T09:12:33Z","rounded_local_amount":154.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221719041},{"amount":54.2,"local_amount":144.53,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-17T08:14:13Z","rounded_local_amount":149.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227350506},{"amount":58.3,"local_amount":155.47,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:48:15Z","rounded_local_amount":160.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232850990}],"funded_date":"2011-05-25T22:27:07Z","paid_date":"2011-10-15T09:48:15Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Pam McMurry","image":null}},{"id":305528,"name":"Rayitos De Sol Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El grupo se llama \u201cRAYITO DE SOL\u201d y se encuentra ubicado en el estado de Morelos en M\u00e9xico.

She is requesting the loan to invest in shoes and cosmetics because people place many orders with her, and sometimes she doesn\u2019t have the money to buy the merchandise they request. She takes advantage of sales to generate greater profit. This allows her to give better prices to her clients who, like her, are hard-working mothers and she likes to help them out by extending them flexible and comfortable payments within their means. This increases her sales, and as a result, strengthens the economic situation of her family. She wants to save a portion of her earnings for her children\u2019s education and give them a better quality of life.

She has a leg injury and hates thinking about it. She joined GHAPE in 2004 and has received and repaid Empowerment credit four times.\r\n\r\nShe plans to invest in her dressmaking and groundnut selling business. She is very sure this business will succeed because she has a good experience in it, and because there is a high demand for groundnut. Her loan will help the community in that it will enable her to make the cloths and groundnuts readily available for local buyers at affordable prices.\r\n\r\nShe will reinvest some of the proceeds realized from this business venture and use the rest to pay house rent, her children\u2019s school fees and to provide medication for her family.\r\n\r\nShe prefers a GHAPE loan because of the low interest rate, because no collateral security is required, because the money is repaid in installments and also because of the training GHAPE gives its members.\r\n\r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon. GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach. Every client is trained in business management, basic health, life skills, financial management, profits and losses, and family values. Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement.

She studied up to 7th grade, then had to interrupt her studies because of an early pregnancy.  She is a widow and mother of 4 daughters, between the ages of 18 and 25 years old.  The oldest is employed, and the other three are in secondary school.  <P>\r\n\r\nAna lost her partner in a car accident in 1990 when they were prepared to get married.  After this tragedy, life was difficult.  He had left her with four children to raise and without a house of their own.  They had been living in a house granted through his job, and after his death they had to vacate the house.  Her parents took her in for three years, and because she was the wife of a state employee she received an indemnity benefit and a house.  In 1993 she took a poultry-raising course for six months at the community center in Namaacha.  Then with the money she had received from the indemnity benefit and monthly pension of 2,700 meticais (MZN), she started raising chickens, which she has continued until today.  She has an average of 300 chickens; spends 18,000MZN; profits 7,500MZN; is able to save 2,000MZN; and rents a chicken coop for 500MZN.  Now she is responsible for no one else besides her daughters.  <P>\r\n\r\nThis is Ana\u2019s third loan and first one with Kiva.  She used the first loan of 15,000MZN and the second of 25,000MZN to buy chickens and feed, and this third loan of 15,000MZN also will be used for the same purpose.  In the future she intends to request more loans to build her own chicken coop and become a great chicken farmer.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by April Newman, Kiva

Thi Cham is 34 years old. She lives with her husband and 2 small children in the district of Me Linh - Ha Noi. She has been a member of TYM fund since 1995. Her first loan was used to invest in raising farm animals. The loan program was so effective that after a period of time, her family was able to save enough to invest in a carpentry\/lumber business. Presently, this business and raising farm animals are their main sources of income. With the next loan, she wishes to borrow 600 USD to purchase additional lumber for her carpentry business\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Vietnamese by Thu

Currently three of them are in school while the last born is still breastfeeding. She has been a food vendor for two years now in the Agogo community school where she lives with her family. She sells rice with stew; this food is mostly purchased by the schoolchildren during their break time. Vida says the demand for her food has extended to the people in the community, so when she closes in the morning she prepares more for the afternoon and sells it in the community market. Vida wants the loan to buy more bags of raw materials like rice, meat, charcoal and others.

He owns a small grocery store, which he first opened four years ago. His store is well known in the neighborhood due to the fact that Rahmatsho has been able to keep it well stocked because of loans received through the Kiva field partner, IMON International. He has plans to expand the store this winter, as he isn't currently able to display all his stock because of limited space. Rahmatsho tells us he's a fighter and that this line of work requires much sacrifice, as he must work everyday, including weekends, starting at 6 am and going well into the evening. In spite of this, he feels very fortunate to have his own business, to be able to support his family and to provide his children with a good education. Rahmatsho is requesting this loan to purchase meats, sugar, milk, flour, beer, wine, etc. Thank you! \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

This will allow her to save money so that she can continue her pharmacy studies and finish her degree.\r\n<p>\r\nSra. Maria is the Treasurer and one of the founding members.  She manages a store and will use her loan to buy various products so that she can diversify her inventory and improve her earnings.\r\n<p>\r\nAll of the members are responsible and dynamic people who have to support their families, and in most cases, do it by themselves.  They are very grateful to Emprender and Kiva for trusting them by providing this loan.\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<br

She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2008 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. \r\n\r\nBy working hard in her Buying and Selling (pigs) and Pig-Fattening businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable.  She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 10,000. Cheryl is now borrowing PHP 20,000 so that she can continue to  fund the operations of her piggery.  This will be her 10th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 13,000, which she paid off well within its term was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Cheryl aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the Dungganon way.\r\n\r\n About NWTF:\r\n\r\n In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed on a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

It is situated among even fields and high slopes.  The neighborhood is comprised of country people who came to the city because of the forced displacement they were subjected to.\r\n\r\nThis is where the small businesswoman, Luz Mery P.

Two years ago she decided to make the traditional \u201carepa\u201d (flat bread served with various fillings or toppings) to support her family.\r\n\r\nLuz Mery cooks the arepas over charcoal.

Habib is a diligent and tenacious farmer, who strives to meet his family\u2019s needs. His wife does not work and thus, he carries the financial burden alone, through his farming income, to meet his family\u2019s needs. Habib works on a 1-hectare farm owned by his parents. His harvests are sometimes not maximized because his cultivation method and seeds are not the best. Better farming supplies, seeds and fertilizer require a larger capital, which he lacks. \r\n\r\nHabib is now relieved that IMON International is helping him to get the loan that he needs to improve his farming. This loan will be used to buy superior seeds, organic fertilizers and pesticides. Habib is waiting for his next harvest, which he hopes will yield better results than his previous harvests. He will use his farming income to support his children\u2019s educational needs. If there is still some money left, he really hopes to fix his unfinished house.      \r\n \r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

So she quickly became interested in revenue-generating businesses from her mother.  Married and the mother of seven children, she lives with her husband and children in the Bagadadji district in San City, San Prefecture (4th administrative region of the Republic of Mali).  She is in high demand by her numerous customers for the quality of her merchandise.  \r\n\r\nConcerned about better satisfying her burgeoning customer base, she decided to turn toward the micro-finance institution Soro Yiriwaso three years ago.

She is very happy and grateful to Fundaci\u00f3n Espoir since with her first loan she started her business.  She is 18 years old and single.  She says that she would live in the country, but her studies brought her to Colorado.  She lives with her aunt and studies at the University of Manta.   She travels every afternoon and evening selling Avon products (beauty products, perfumes and women's accessories) taking advantage of her university connections to sell to her classmates.  She sells her products on credit and collects payments weekly or every 2 weeks.  She says that she always orders what her customers request and, until now, it has gone very well since she has earned what she needs to live and for her studies.  \r\n\r\nShe will use this loan to buy more products since she has many orders and still has not collected on the merchandise that has been delivered.   Her goals are to finish school and  practice her profession as a graduate.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ann Achilli, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":900,"image":{"id":601563,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To purchase Avon beauty products and perfumes","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Portoviejo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2010-09-17T18:20:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":900,"lender_count":35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Melissa Lisseth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-09-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":880,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":73.33},{"due_date":"2010-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":73.33},{"due_date":"2010-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":73.33},{"due_date":"2010-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":73.33},{"due_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":73.33},{"due_date":"2010-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":73.33},{"due_date":"2010-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":73.33},{"due_date":"2011-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":73.33},{"due_date":"2011-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":73.33},{"due_date":"2011-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":73.33},{"due_date":"2011-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":73.33},{"due_date":"2011-03-12T08:00:00Z","amount":73.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":74.99},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":74.99},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":74.99},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.99},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.04}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":75,"local_amount":73.33,"processed_date":"2010-10-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T13:57:32Z","rounded_local_amount":75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177407455},{"amount":74.99,"local_amount":73.33,"processed_date":"2010-10-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T13:58:25Z","rounded_local_amount":74.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177407456},{"amount":75,"local_amount":73.33,"processed_date":"2010-11-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-21T10:29:44Z","rounded_local_amount":75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":183388595},{"amount":75,"local_amount":73.33,"processed_date":"2010-11-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-21T10:30:29Z","rounded_local_amount":75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":183388596},{"amount":74.99,"local_amount":73.33,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-21T10:31:46Z","rounded_local_amount":74.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":183388597},{"amount":150,"local_amount":146.66,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T13:10:56Z","rounded_local_amount":150,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188682929},{"amount":149.99,"local_amount":146.66,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T03:31:25Z","rounded_local_amount":149.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191422053},{"amount":149.99,"local_amount":146.66,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:40:31Z","rounded_local_amount":149.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195840856},{"amount":75.04,"local_amount":73.37,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:01:29Z","rounded_local_amount":75.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201283354}],"funded_date":"2010-09-18T17:33:59Z","paid_date":"2011-04-15T11:01:29Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":235890,"name":"Myagmardolgor","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Myagmardolgor T. is 50 years old and lives with her husband and two daughters in an apartment in Ulaanbaatar, the capital of Mongolia.
