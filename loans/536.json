She lives with her husband, Luis, 43, and their 4 children, Florentina, 10, Fredy, 9, Candy, 8 and Erika, 7, in their own house.  Her children are the motivating force in her life.  For several years, Florentina has raised cattle.  This has allowed the family to have a worthy life.  She has been in this line of work since she was 13 years old and she is now one of the most sought-after cattlewomen thanks to the big steers she brings into the city to sell.  What she likes most about her work is raising the cattle because she knows that, the better she cares for them, the better prices her steers will command.  She has been in this line of work for 25 years and she feels that the most difficult aspect of it is transporting the steers to the sales points because this activity is very labor intensive.  For later in the future, she would like to open a grocery store to generate extra income and, thus, improve her family's quality of life.  This is Justina's second loan with MFP and she feels obliged to repay on time because she doesn't want any problems with her fellow members where she is very well-liked because of the joy she brings to the meetings.  With the 1000 new soles requested she will buy fodder for her animals because she wants them to be well fed in order to sell them at the best price.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":457004,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy animal feed.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Juliaca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15.5 -70.133333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-12-24T19:30:22Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Justina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-12-27T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2010-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2010-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2010-03-29T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2010-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2010-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":165}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-12-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T15:24:01Z","rounded_local_amount":168.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110735007},{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2010-01-26T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:10:40Z","rounded_local_amount":168.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118124373},{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2010-02-25T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:49:19Z","rounded_local_amount":168.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123960114},{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2010-03-29T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:33:16Z","rounded_local_amount":168.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128992958},{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2010-04-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:37:59Z","rounded_local_amount":168.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136717744},{"amount":57.75,"local_amount":165,"processed_date":"2010-05-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:39:42Z","rounded_local_amount":166.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144751420}],"funded_date":"2009-12-24T20:22:13Z","paid_date":"2010-06-15T09:39:42Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":169380,"name":"Elva","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Elva tiene 27 a\u00f1os, vive con su hijo de 10 a\u00f1os en una casa arrendada.\nSu principal actividad es la venta de los productos que ella misma siembra en sus tierras de cultivo, y las de sus familiares.

Ella se dedica a la crianza de vacas, vende leche y hace queso, inici\u00f3 su negocio hace 4 a\u00f1os. Solicita el pr\u00e9stamo para la  compra de alimento y forrajes para sus vacas y tambi\u00e9n quiere comprar unos pollos para engordarlos y despu\u00e9s venderlos, ya que suele dedicarse a la crianza de animales en general, pues comenta, todo es negocio y hay que aprovechar. Sus clientes y vecinos la consideran una mujer muy activa y trabajadora pues a pesar de no tener una preparaci\u00f3n acad\u00e9mica es una excelente administrador, quien adem\u00e1s de atender su negocio y su hogar tiene bajo su cuidado a dos de sus nietecitos, a quienes desde ahora les inculca el amor al trabajo. \nAl momento de solicitar este pr\u00e9stamo se siente motivada  a seguir adelante y agradecida por la oportunidad que se le brinda de obtener un cr\u00e9dito sin tanto requisito.

Adem\u00e1s tiene la ventaja de que podr\u00e1 atender sus dos negocios a la vez pues mientras sus clientas compran tortillas, podr\u00e1n ver su joyer\u00eda y as\u00ed poco a poco se ir\u00e1n animando a comprar alguna novedad. De esta manera con las ganancias que ambos le generen tendr\u00e1 la oportunidad de establecer bien su negocio de tortillas ya que actualmente lo trabaja en un peque\u00f1o espacio de un local que le prestaron y para ella su sue\u00f1o es tener su propio localito bien equipado y acondicionado para brindar mejor calidad y servicio a sus clientes. \nAl momento de solicitar este pr\u00e9stamo se muestra muy optimista porque para ella es muy importante que su negocio crezca y comenta \u00e9sta es una buena oportunidad con la que espera sacar adelante a su familia.  \n\nLas dem\u00e1s integrantes del grupo son:\n-\tGabriela M.

There are ten members in the group.\r\n<p>\r\nEleuteria Mart\u00ednez L. is one of the group members.  She is 61 years old and has no education.  Eleuteria works as a homemaker and farmer.  She has seven children, three daughters and four sons, who are all grown and care for her two grandchildren (ages 10 and 6).  Eleuteria raises dairy cows, sells the milk, and produces cheese.  She started this business four years ago.  The loan she is requesting will be used to buy feed and fodder for her cows.  She will also buy a few chickens to fatten for subsequent resale since she already raises animals.  Eleuteria says her business is everything, so she has to make the most of it.  Her customers and neighbors consider her to be an active and hardworking woman who is an excellent manager despite not having any academic training.  In addition to tending to her business and household, she also looks after her two young grandchildren in whom she tries to instill a love of work.  At the time of this loan request, Eleuteria felt motivated to press forward and was appreciative of this opportunity to obtain a loan with few requirements.  She hopes to secure this loan so that she can maintain her business with which she will be able to leave an inheritance for her grandchildren.\r\n<p>\r\nIrma O. V. is the group president.  She is 42 years old, married, and has a sixth grade education.  Irma has three children, a daughter (age 2) and two sons (ages 4 and 5).  A year ago, she started her business selling handmade tortillas.  She is requesting a loan so that she can start a costume jewelry business since she already has experience.  At the moment, Irma is doing very well but she believes this will be a better option to earn more household income to provide her children a higher quality of life.  She will also have the advantage of running two businesses at the same time because customers who buy tortillas will be able to see her jewelry.  Gradually they will be convinced to buy some of her novelties.  With the earnings from both ventures, she will have the opportunity to improve her tortilla business since the location where she currently works is a small space.  Her dream is to have a better location that is well-equipped and suited for providing a better quality of service to her customers.  At the time of her loan request, Irma was very optimistic because she says growing her business is a good opportunity for her family to get ahead.\r\n<p>\r\n The other group members are as follows:\r\n- Gabriela M.

Adela was left alone to take care of their 5 children.\r\n<p>\r\nAdela is probably the best known emollient woman in Santa Ana street. Adela has an herbal tea stand in the street. For many years Adela has been warming up many worker's mornings who leave their homes in a rush with out eating breakfast and pass by Santa Rosa street to drink their beverage: lukewarm, cold, or very hot, all year round and depending on the season. She works from Monday to Saturday from 6 a.m. to 10 a.m. Adela also works in the restaurant \"Emperador\" (Emperor) located on San Francisco Plaza as a chef. She has been working there for 23 years and started out as a dishwasher but now is the main cook.\r\n<p>\r\nWith the next loan Adela awaits to receive 1,000 Peruvian Soles. She would like to use the loan money for personal use to open a private clinic.\r\n<p>  \r\nThe communal bank \"Cusi Ccoyllor de Chinchero\" has been active for two and a half years and Adela joined two years ago and she likes it very much. The name of the communal bank is a Quechua term (the native language) meaning \" Beautiful Chinchero Princess.\"<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Susan Garza, Kiva

She will use the profits to buy some clothes for her children for Christmas and to invest in her business. \r\n\r\nThis Esperanza associate began with us because of \"the respect that Esperanza offered to us and the type of program that we receive.\" Her story is representative of her group and, generally, of Esperanza's Haitian and Dominican clients (many of whom recently emigrated to the Dominican Republic from Haiti). Her group is located in the rural areas surrounding La Romana, where the sugarcane harvest and tourist industry dominates the economy. This area, like nearly all impoverished areas of the Dominican Republic, suffers from unreliable running water (none of which is potable) and electricity.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4625,"image":{"id":660517,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing

Siham, who is photographed in the store with her husband, is planning to expand the store to have a big and good reputation, which will secure a good life for her family.\r\n\r\nAbout this loan product:\r\nFATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

He studied pharmacology at a recognized local institute, but his dreams came together by establishing his own business.  Five years ago, Wilfredo started devoting his time and efforts into farming.  He grows a variety of crops in mass quantities on his parents\u2019 land such as peas, potatoes, and gladiola flowers.  In addition, he has a pharmacy that is stocked with medicines that he sells to the local villagers whenever they are sick.  Throughout this entire time, Wilfredo has done very well.  He also owns an automobile that he makes available for public transportation.  Now he is aware that good prices are being offered for products sold at the central market in Tarma, so he wants to improve the quality of his crops.  For this reason, Wilfredo has started to look for additional farmland that has had a chance to rest so that he can produce fruits that have nutritional value.

One of her daughters, Enny, helps her with the business by selling her mother\u2019s merchandise to her friends and neighbors. \r\n<p>Maria Isabel needs a loan of US$ 475 because her sales have increased and she needs to purchase more merchandise. She comments that thanks to her business she feels independent because her income is good and she does not need to ask her husband for money to cover her basic expenses. She works every afternoon and during the weekends she dedicates more time to the business. She feels so proud of her achievements and she one day wants to have her own clothes store in a good place.\r\n<P>**This text has been translated from the original business description.**<P>Hace 4 a\u00f1os Maria Isabel, decidi\u00f3 ponerse a vender ropa para ayudar con los gastos del hogar, consideraba que era una actividad muy pr\u00e1ctica, ya que con ella no descuidar\u00eda su casa y el cuidado de sus hijos. Maria Isabel esta casada y su esposo es alba\u00f1il. Una de sus hijas de nombre Enny le ayuda en el negocio, va y surte mercanc\u00eda para vender entre sus amistades y vecinos y le ayuda a cobrar los d\u00edas  de pago. Esta solicitando un pr\u00e9stamo de US $475 a 6 meses, pues se le han incrementado las ventas con motivo del cambio de temporada, por lo que necesita invertir en mercanc\u00eda. Ella comenta que gracias al negocio, se siente independiente, pues las ganancias son buenas y no necesita estar pidiendo dinero a su esposo para cubrir sus gastos m\u00e1s b\u00e1sicos. Su negocio lo atiende un rato por las tardes y los fines de semana, que es cuando le dedica mayor tiempo. Se siente satisfecha con lo que esta logrando y no descarta la posibilidad de llegar a tener su propia tienda de ropa bien establecida.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":1433,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing

Everyone in his family works: women work at home, and men at the market.  They purchase young calves, feed and grow them and then sell them.  Current animal prices are very low, so Saifuddin wants to obtain this loan to purchase one more bull and to increase his cattle headcount.

And he does not have to spend much for animal feed because livestock eats mountain grass, and, thus, Saidanvar saves on livestock feed.

They are engaged in businesses like selling clothes, food, cosmetics, bread, empanadas, and soft drinks.  Some of them have work as porters, as taxi drivers, and as domestic employees.  All of them have scant resources, but they are very hard-working and responsible.  That is the reason that they do not have much competition.  Their work is hard and difficult to do.\r\n\r\nThe loan is to invest in new businesses to leave some difficult jobs like being a domestic employee and carrying luggage.  These jobs are having an adverse affect on the members\u2019 health.  The rest of the members need a loan to buy cheaper merchandise and supplies to increase their sales and improve their income.  This will help them improve the quality of life for their families.  \r\n\r\nAs far as the members\u2019 experience goes, they have demonstrated responsibility in their payments.  Above all, all of them have the desire to keep growing.  That is why the institution offers them a new economic support.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva

Efren has successfully repaid a previous loan of 30,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional inventory. Efren is requesting a new loan of 25,000 PHP which will also be used to purchase additional inventory. This loan will be the eighth loan taken out by Efren from ASKI. He plans to use the additional revenue to improve his business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines.

She used her first three Grameen America loans to get her business off the ground and acquire the necessary licensing and permit stickers. Now, she is seeking a fourth loan of 3,000 USD to stock up on ice cream and other ingredients and to renew her permit sticker so she can continue growing her business doing what she loves. Maria hopes to one day buy a food cart big enough for her to cook and serve a wide array of her favorite foods, from ice cream to tamales.

She has one child.\r\n\r\nFilomena owns and  operates a business venture, planting and harvesting taro (a potato-like tuber) for sale. She has one year of experience in this business.\r\n\r\nFilomena needs a loan of WST 1,500 to purchase additional seeds, seedlings and young crops to raise. She plans to use the profit from her business (estimated to be 500 WST or US $208 per week) to financially support the immediate members of her family.\r\n\r\nFilomena joined SPBD to gain access to financial services. Most of SPBD's clients are unable to borrow from commercial banks because they lack collateral. This is Filomena's second loan with SPBD. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*SPBD evaluates the living conditions of each of its borrowers.  Generally, a loan manager evaluates a variety of social metrics on a scale out of 3 (the higher the number, the better off the person is) and these are averaged for the \"\"overall social metric score.\"\"  For example, a 3 out of 3 on \"\"level of education\"\" would mean that the borrower has graduated from university.  \r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.

is the mother of a family, and every day she strives to give the best of herself to her small children.  She has practiced embroidery since her childhood, as her parents taught her this worthy trade with diligence.  Today, thanks to this, she can support her family.  This fills her with satisfaction because she can use her money to secure the well-being of her family.  Not long ago, she formed a co-operative of embroiderers with her brother, in which they work adorning traditional suits.  The embroidery and preparation of a suit takes her one to two months depending on the complexity of the work.  She always makes a suit according to the preferences of the client.  She now plans to keep working even more and plans to raise animals to be able to provide for the needs of her home when there is scarce demand for her suits.  This is why she is requesting a loan of $200, which she will invest in the purchase of fabric and thread to continue creating her beautiful hand-made adornments for the benefit of her children.  Let's help these marvelous hands that create a promising future every day.  <p><b>Translated from Spanish by Tanya Harper, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nVictorinda es una madre de familia que cada d\u00eda se esfuerza por dar lo mejor de s\u00ed a sus peque\u00f1os hijos.Se dedica al bordado desde su ni\u00f1ez ya que sus padres le ense\u00f1aron con diligencia este digno oficio y hoy gracias a ello puede sostener a su familia.Esto la llena de satisfacci\u00f3n porque puede disponer de su dinero para procurarle bienestar a su familia y junto a su hermano hace poco  han formado una sociedad de bordadores en la cual se desempe\u00f1an adornando trajes t\u00edpicos.

When the agricultural expansion plan introduced to all provinces, Mrs. Gi\u1edbi has soon realized that that was a very rare opportunity. While other families might use their monies to build houses, she wisely used her money to invest in her farm. The investment brings her a handsome income. Currently she has a nice half acre farm which produces vegetable for the Hanoi\u2019s markets. The product impresses the Office of Agricultural Encouragement of the Department of Agriculture and the office endorses it as an agricultural model for the province. Recently she invested 1,500USD to purchase 500 grapefruit trees for her current project. This time she is applying for a loan of 950USD to purchase more fruit trees and fertilizer.  \r\n\r\n<p style=\"font-style: italic; font-size: 10px;\">Translated from Vietnamese by ngungo, Kiva volunteer.<\/p><br \/>  \r\n \r\nCh\u1ecb Ho\u00e0ng Th\u1ecb Gi\u1edbi, 38 tu\u1ed5i, s\u1ed1ng c\u00f9ng ch\u1ed3ng v\u00e0 2 con \u0111ang trong \u0111\u1ed9 tu\u1ed5i \u0111i h\u1ecdc t\u1ea1i M\u00ea Linh, V\u0129nh Ph\u00fac.

This is 44-year-old Chausiku M. from Kyela. She is married with four children, between the ages of 10 and 28. Additionally, she is responsible for supporting 2 dependants who are orphans. Chausiku has been running a local restaurant, 'Mama Lishe', since 1996. <p>\r\n\r\nWhen you see a SELFINA entrepreneur whose business title is 'restaurant' or 'caf\u00e9', you may have to adjust your mental image of what that is. A local restaurant or caf\u00e9 in Tanzania usually consists of a rough wooden table and some long, wooden benches, with the sky as a ceiling. Such places don\u2019t even appear in the Lonely Planet\u2019s budget guide, but if you\u2019re looking for a cheap and tasty meal, and someone to have a chat with, this is the place to be. The food is all-local: rice, ugali (a hot sticky dough, made from maize flour), plantain (a cooked savoury banana), all served with beans, vegetables, meat, and a variety of yummy sauces.<p>\r\n\r\nShe works at the business for 9-21 hours per day, 7 days per week. Chausiku currently earns about $170 USD a month from her business. She is requesting a loan of $250 USD in order to purchase additional stock of maize flour, rice, beans, and cooking oil. In the future, she plans to establish another business and to employ more workers. Chausiku thanks you for your support!<p>\r\n\r\nABOUT SELFINA:<p>\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":237783,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Restaurant","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To purchase additional stock of maize flour, rice, beans, and cooking oil","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Kyela","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-9.583333 33.85","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-12-13T01:30:17Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":250,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Chausiku D.","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-12-30T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":300000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":41.67,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-01-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:17:06Z","rounded_local_amount":51666.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14887047},{"amount":41.67,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:04:49Z","rounded_local_amount":51666.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20436307},{"amount":41.67,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-03-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:56:53Z","rounded_local_amount":51666.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130579},{"amount":41.66,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-04-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:26:30Z","rounded_local_amount":51666.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027376},{"amount":41.67,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-05-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:15:10Z","rounded_local_amount":51666.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613377},{"amount":41.66,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-06-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:03:03Z","rounded_local_amount":51666.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010457}],"funded_date":"2008-12-13T04:06:02Z","paid_date":"2009-07-16T00:03:03Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Michelle Wigg","image":1373520}},{"id":83098,"name":"Gladys","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Gladys N. is married, has 5 dependants, and received schooling through junior high.

Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":317968,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"To purchase more clothes and to increase her capital.

Saifiniso is 52 years old and comes from a large and humble family. She is a widow and the loving mother of two children. Her father's hard and demanding character showed her, from the time she was young, the significant value of work, and therefore she has been successful in various activities throughout her life. Now she dedicates herself to raising and selling cows. With the income she generates she provides a better quality of life for her children, who are her greatest joy and have become her best friends. Saifiniso asks for a loan of $700 USD in order to buy more young cattle to later sell when they are fully grown. With this investment Saifiniso will be able to substantially grow her earnings and improve her quality of life. Let\u2019s support this dedicated mother's proposal.\r\n<p>\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n<p>\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\nIMON's History\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Now he makes stoves and sells to his own clients and earns a good profit.\r\n \r\nNaheed has applied for a loan from Kiva partner Asasah for her husband\u2019s business. With the loan, he will buy steel and iron in larger quantities and that will enable him to make more stoves and to complete the orders for his clients.  Naheed is hopeful that with this investment, her husband will be able to improve his business and increasing his sales. \r\n\r\nShe is a new loan applicant of Asasah and this is her first loan application.

With the help of her past four loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Jacqueline has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 8,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 10,000 uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her fifth loan, she is borrowing PHP 13,000 to buy new tools and equipment for her motorcycle transport business so that she can serve more passengers and earn a higher income.

She has five years of experience in this business. Senerita needs a loan of WST $1,500 to purchase additional fish to raise. She plans to use the profit from her business (estimated to be 400 talas or US $167 per week) to improve and expand the business. She and her husband have eight children.\r\n \r\nIn 2009, Senerita joined SPBD to gain access to financial services. Most of SPBD's clients are unable to borrow from commercial banks because they lack collateral. This is Senerita's second loan with SPBD. \r\n \r\n*SPBD evaluates the living conditions of each of its borrowers. Generally, a loan manager evaluates a variety of social metrics on a scale out of 3 (the higher the number, the better off the person is) and these are averaged for the \"overall social metric score.\" For example, a 3 out of 3 on \"level of education\" would mean that the borrower has graduated from university.  \r\n\r\nAbout SPBD:\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem. Please join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":928275,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fishing","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to

Married and the mother of three children, she started her business about 13 years ago when she needed to find a job right away and business ownership was her best opportunity. She currently sells a range of men\u2019s shirts at the large central market in Tursunzde. Fotima has a reputation for treating customers with care and kindness, qualities that set her apart from many other businesses that often lack good customer service. Fotima has also proven to be a great client with IMON International, having successfully repaid 6 loans. She has requested a loan of 5000 Somoni to purchase new inventory and continue developing her business. \r\n\r\n<P>More about Tajikistan and IMON International<\/P>\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

This has been the experience of Elvira A. of Canonoy, Hinigaran, Negros Occidental. Elvira is 49 years old and is married with four children who are between 18 and 25 years old.\r\n\r\nElvira's husband earns a living by fishing. Years ago, they owned a small unmotorized fishing boat that he had to paddle to go to sea. This was truly hard work, especially during stormy weather when the waves are a lot rougher than usual. But, because he had no other way to earn money to feed and support his family, he determinedly rowed his boat to sea everyday to catch fish, so that Elvira would have something to sell to people in their community and neighboring villages.\r\n\r\nIn 2000, Elvira, with the consent of her husband, decided to join NWTF-Project Dungganon so that they could borrow money to improve their income. With the new capital, Elvira opened a small general store so that she could earn a little more. As she made good on her loan repayments and established a good credit record, she was able to borrow larger amounts to improve her income potential.\r\n\r\nOne of their first investments from her loans was a joint decision to buy a motor for their fishing boat so that her husband could reach deeper waters and catch more fish - which he did. The motorized fishing boat and the income from the general store made a big impact on improving their family's quality of life. They currently earn a net monthly income of PHP 8,000 from their two business activities. The fishing business is doing quite well, so that Elvira and her husband are now saving up to buy another motorized fishing boat to increase their income even further.\r\n\r\nAs previously mentioned here, Elvira has kept a good credit record with NWTF-Project Dungganon. In her previous loan she borrowed Php 10,000 as additional capital for their businesses and, as is her usual practice, she was able to pay it off within the loan term and without any delays in the weekly installments. Now she is borrowing Php 15,000 so that they can finally purchase their second motorized boat. The income from it will be used to buy more productive assets so that they can continue improving their family's quality of life.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b> About NWTF:<\/b>\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress out of earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":423651,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fishing","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To

por largo tiempo y desde muy temprana edad, trabaj\u00f3 como ayudante de electricidad en talleres informales donde gan\u00f3 una importante experiencia cuando se arriesg\u00f3 a hacer trabajos personales y fue as\u00ed como se dio a conocer; por cosas del destino, sali\u00f3 de su pueblo ubicado en el departamento del Magdalena con su esposa hace 4 a\u00f1os a vivir en Soledad, buscando una vida tranquila y productiva; inicialmente recibi\u00f3 del Gobierno Nacional un primer cr\u00e9dito de $1.000.000, con ese dinero compr\u00f3 repuestos y gradualmente fue agregando, una vitrina que poco a poco fue llenando de mercanc\u00edas y en este momento cuenta con vitrinas, estanter\u00eda, un escritorio de trabajo y gran variedad de herramientas para el trabajo diversificado que realiza; pues adem\u00e1s de ofrecer sus servicios como electricista, tambi\u00e9n realiza mantenimiento, reparaciones y adecuaciones domiciliarias, es decir se le mide a todo. Mario est\u00e1 casado y tiene 3 hijos menores entre los 8 y 11 a\u00f1os, su esposa lo acompa\u00f1a y tambi\u00e9n trabaja en su peque\u00f1a miscel\u00e1nea que atiende desde su casa y que le da la oportunidad de estar al cuidado personal de sus peque\u00f1os hijos, porque eso es lo que proporciona el tener un negocio en el mismo lugar donde se habita.

Este es su segundo cr\u00e9dito con la Fundaci\u00f3n por valor de $ 1.600.000 con el planea comprar una vitrina y surtir el negocio; a Mario le ha gustado estar en la Fundaci\u00f3n por la sensibilidad social de sus asesores con ellos pueden ser sinceros para que la ayuda sea m\u00e1s efectiva. Sus sue\u00f1o es especializarse en electr\u00f3nica cuando el negocio tome un mayor auge, aumente su mercado y por consiguiente las ventas.

He managed to improve his skills when he received a technical degree from SENA when he was 22. For a long time, and since he was very young, he worked as an electrician's assistant in informal shops. There he gained valuable experience for when he risked jobs on his own and this was how he learned. \r\n\r\nFor reasons of destiny, he left his hometown located in the department of Magdalena with his wife of four years, to live in Soledad, looking for a calm and productive life. Initially Mario received his first credit of $1,000,000 COP from the National Government. With this money he bought spare parts, which he gradually accumulated, he bought a display case, and little by little he filled it with merchandise. Now he has display cases, shelves, a work bench and a great variety of tools for the various jobs that he does. In addition to the services he offers as an electrician, he also does maintenance work, repairs and remodeling, which he to say he does everything.  \r\n\r\nMario and his wife have 3 young children between the ages of 8-11 years old. His wife accompanies him and also does her own miscellaneous jobs that she can attend to from their home and which allows her the opportunity to care for their small children, this is the benefit of having a business in the home. They began with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo because of a friend that knew the organization well and had become a promoter of its benefits. This friend recommended them to the loan officer, Milgen S\u00e1nchez, because she knew that Mario and his wife were very responsible and that the couple is always seeking ways to improve themselves. When SENA brought trainings to their neighborhood, Mario and his wife participated knowing that it would help them to better manage their business. \r\n\r\nThis will be the second credit with the Fundaci\u00f3n for the amount of $ 1.600.000 COP. Mario plans to buy a display case and to support the business. Mario has liked working with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo for the social sensitivity of the loan officers because Mario can be sincere with them so that they can help him most effectively. His dream is to specialize in electronics once the business takes off, increasing his inventory and as a result his sales. His greatest challenge is to obtain a home because his family is leasing. He hopes to qualify for the state programs to obtain homes so that he will no longer have to lease. Mario lives in a good neighborhood because his neighbors like his family and they all help each other, what's more there are many organizations that are based there to support families and especially his childrens' school where they receive a scholarship and Mario is very grateful for the school and he helps with the things that he knows how to do like paint, repair the walls and do electrical repairs. He has earned a good reputation with the director of the school and the faculty that educates his children.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Kelly McKinnon, Kiva

Married to Christian Odo, a transport driver, Tossivi is the mother of seven children, only two of which she still supports.  All of her children attend school.  The couple lives together with their children.  Tossivi and her husband share the family expenses.  Tossivi\u2019s business is selling wood charcoal, both retail and wholesale.  She also sells vegetable and palm oil.  Tossivi sells her products out of her own home, but she does her buying at Bassila and Pahou, two large markets in Benin.  Though she never attended school, Tossivi has been managing her business for about 13 years.  Tossivi is a great client of ALID\u00e9, because she has received seven loans which have all been paid back.  Tossivi would like to buy a quantity of stock large enough to increase her profit margin, but she is limited for financial reasons.  This is why Tossivi would like to take out an eighth loan with ALID\u00e9.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Chelsea Rosendale, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":491879,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Charcoal Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Purchasing 100-kg bags of wood charcoal and bottles of peanut and palm oil","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BJ","country":"Benin","town":"Cotonou Agence principale","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"9.5 2.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":104,"posted_date":"2010-02-21T00:10:11Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Tossivi ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-12T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":150000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2010-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2010-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2010-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2010-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2010-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2010-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2010-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2010-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2011-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":15000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":32.5,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T09:41:16Z","rounded_local_amount":15810.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136619362},{"amount":32.5,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T08:40:39Z","rounded_local_amount":15810.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144653181},{"amount":32.5,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-16T07:32:05Z","rounded_local_amount":15810.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151835369},{"amount":32.5,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T09:10:13Z","rounded_local_amount":15810.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159575763},{"amount":32.5,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-30T08:14:46Z","rounded_local_amount":15810.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166954277},{"amount":32.5,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-30T08:52:06Z","rounded_local_amount":15810.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172055937},{"amount":32.5,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-27T10:03:09Z","rounded_local_amount":15810.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177347470},{"amount":7.58,"local_amount":3500,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-05T09:07:05Z","rounded_local_amount":3689.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188617427},{"amount":39,"local_amount":18000,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T08:09:09Z","rounded_local_amount":18972.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191360847},{"amount":27.07,"local_amount":12493,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-28T09:13:37Z","rounded_local_amount":13168.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195780073},{"amount":23.85,"local_amount":11007,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-16T08:08:27Z","rounded_local_amount":11601.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201401896}],"funded_date":"2010-02-21T13:09:21Z","paid_date":"2011-04-16T08:08:27Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Chelsea Rosendale","image":754499}},{"id":182215,"name":"Bunnarith","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mr. Bunnarith H. is a motor remoque driver and has been married to Mrs. Sokmoeun Yoy since 1994.

The oldest is 4 years old and next year he will begin kindergarten. \n\nOne of Leticia and Freddy's dreams is to save enough money to be able to buy a small house. Leticia worked with our institution for a previous loan and proved herself to be very punctual and responsible with the repayment.

She is married to Nche Michael Nji and they are blessed with five children.

Amongst other challenges, she needs more capital to be able to continue with her projects and personal life. \r\n\r\n<p>With this loan, G. plans to cultivate maize, beans, yams, cassavas, and huckleberries. She also intends to buy improved maize seeds and yams for her farm plot and stock petrol and firewood to sell. The loan will help her community because they will be able to buy petrol and firewood at affordable quantities and prices. G. will reinvest her profit into her business and use a fraction of it to pay for her children's education and upgrade her standard of living. She prefers a loan from GHAPE because of the training she frequently receives, the follow-up and the moderate interest rate.\r\n\r\nABOUT GHAPE \r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon. GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach.

His passion for agriculture led him to acquire his own land, where he has been working independently for 11 years. He cultivates cocoa plants and coca leaves in his fields. At harvest time, he counts on the help of laborers to pick both crops with greater speed, so that he can complete the work more quickly. He feels very committed to his work, and thanks to his daily efforts, today he is able to see the fruits of his labor. He earns a good profit for each kilogram of product sold.\r\n\r\nHe explains that the winter season is not to his liking because in those months there is an abundance of insects and rain, which keep him from doing his work and can damage his crops.\r\n\r\nThe requested loan will be used to buy more cocoa plants, which he will then graft in order have good results in little time. For now he is prioritizing the purchase of new lands to expand his planting and increase his production. This is his second loan through MFP and he is prepared to make all of his repayments punctually, as he would like to be able to access more credit in the future.

She owns and operates a business venture, selling snacks and other delicacies in the local community.  She has two years of experience in this business.  Tafao needs a loan of $1,500 Samoan Talas (WST) to purchase raw ingredients needed to make products for sale.  She plans to use the profit from her business (estimated to be 400 WST or $167 US per week) to improve and expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Tafao joined SPBD to gain access to financial services.  Most of SPBD's clients are unable to borrow from commercial banks because they lack collateral. This is Tafao's third loan with SPBD.\r\n\r\n*SPBD evaluates the living conditions of each of its borrowers. Generally, a loan manager evaluates a variety of social metrics on a scale out of 3 (the higher the number, the better off the person is) and these are averaged for the \"overall social metric score.\"  For example, a 3 out of 3 on \"level of education\" would mean that the borrower has graduated from university.  \r\n\r\nAbout SPBD: In 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.

It is the kind of place local people send their children running to fetch something when they are in the middle of cooking the evening meal, and don\u2019t have time to go all the way to the market to buy the missing ingredient."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":164746,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To purchase additional stocks of rice, flour, fruits and vegetables in bulk.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbarali","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.433333 34.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-05-31T20:20:15Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":275,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Merey","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-06-16T07:30:34Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":300000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2008-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":30000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":28,"local_amount":30545.45,"processed_date":"2008-07-16T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:39:13Z","rounded_local_amount":33223.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":268961},{"amount":28,"local_amount":30545.45,"processed_date":"2008-08-16T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:42:49Z","rounded_local_amount":33223.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":298077},{"amount":28,"local_amount":30545.45,"processed_date":"2008-09-16T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-09-22T07:14:37Z","rounded_local_amount":33223.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":328655},{"amount":28,"local_amount":30545.45,"processed_date":"2008-10-16T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-22T07:18:42Z","rounded_local_amount":33223.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":362588},{"amount":25.5,"local_amount":27818.2,"processed_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T03:24:54Z","rounded_local_amount":30257.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5347716},{"amount":27.5,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:09:55Z","rounded_local_amount":32630.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9970304},{"amount":27.5,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:13:54Z","rounded_local_amount":32630.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14886554},{"amount":27.5,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:02:56Z","rounded_local_amount":32630.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20435839},{"amount":27.5,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:55:18Z","rounded_local_amount":32630.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130144},{"amount":27.5,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:23:34Z","rounded_local_amount":32630.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36026977}],"funded_date":"2008-06-02T07:30:34Z","paid_date":"2009-05-15T23:23:34Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":54439,"name":"Path","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Path H., age 41, is a true entrepreneur working in the Prey Veng province.

Institute Magburaka, Tonkolili District, Northern Sierra Leone. Government Technical Institute, Magburaka, was founded in 1962 by the government for the promotion of technical and vocational education. They teach mechanical engineering, carpentry and joinery, block laying and concreting, automobile engineering, plumbing and sheet metal work, painting and decoration and many more. Presently, the institute has a total of fourteen staff and twenty-five students. \n\nThe ten years old civil war tremendously disrupted the smooth running of the institute. Before the war, the institute used to have an enrollment of about 200 \u2013 300 students. In 1997 \u2013 2002, rebels vandalized the whole institute \u2013 buildings were unroofed, labs and libraries destroyed. However Sababu Education, a World Bank sponsored project is currently rehabilating the institute. But the project does not call for reequipping the laboratories and libraries.\n\nGovernment Technical Institute Magburaka is the only government technical institute in Magburaka town. Over the years, the institute has been able to train so many technicians serving both within and without Sierra Leone. It makes good grades at the external examinations organized by City and Guilds of London Institute. The institute also serves as a consultancy and guard to the people of Magburaka. \n\nThis is the first loan Government Technical Institute is requesting from Kiva through SMT. With this loan, some of these teachers will start a small business and those who are already running small businesses will invest the loan into their businesses. Some of the staff members will be using the loan to buy pieces of furniture, others to pay either for their children in their education or pay for themselves to pursue further studies. Others will use their loan in home building projects.  \n\nDavid E.A. K. is the principal at the Institute. He has been a teacher for forty-three years now.  Mr. K. (right) was born in Makurgbo, nine miles from Magburaka. He is sixty-one years of age, married to a teacher and the two of them have five children. Four of their children are in secondary schools and the eldest is already a grown-up. Mr. K. will use his loan to pay his children\u2019s school fees and solve many of his domestic problems. \n\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2700,"image":{"id":288764,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Primary\/secondary school costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Conflict Zones"],"use":"To pay school fees for children","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SL","country":"Sierra Leone","town":"Magburaka, Tonkolili","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"8.5 -11.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":57,"posted_date":"2009-03-18T17:40:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2700,"lender_count":92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Amadu E.d.","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"David E.a ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Santigie A.","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alfre A.w","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hudson S.","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Daniel B.","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Brima S.","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-02-26T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"SLL","disbursal_amount":8200000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":2700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":820000},{"due_date":"2009-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":820000},{"due_date":"2009-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":820000},{"due_date":"2009-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":820000},{"due_date":"2009-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":820000},{"due_date":"2009-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":820000},{"due_date":"2009-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":820000},{"due_date":"2009-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":820000},{"due_date":"2009-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":820000},{"due_date":"2009-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":820000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":270},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":270},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":270},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":270},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":270},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":270},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":270},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":270},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":270},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":270}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":270,"local_amount":820000,"processed_date":"2009-03-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:47:57Z","rounded_local_amount":822150.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27128936},{"amount":270,"local_amount":820000,"processed_date":"2009-04-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:15:58Z","rounded_local_amount":822150.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36025756},{"amount":472.5,"local_amount":1435000,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T07:55:47Z","rounded_local_amount":1438762.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53008559},{"amount":337.5,"local_amount":1025000,"processed_date":"2009-07-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:24:05Z","rounded_local_amount":1027687.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63230896},{"amount":270,"local_amount":820000,"processed_date":"2009-08-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:38:38Z","rounded_local_amount":822150.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73662622},{"amount":270,"local_amount":820000,"processed_date":"2009-09-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-22T11:11:13Z","rounded_local_amount":822150.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87102902},{"amount":270,"local_amount":820000,"processed_date":"2009-10-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T06:07:44Z","rounded_local_amount":822150.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97019916},{"amount":270,"local_amount":820000,"processed_date":"2009-11-26T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:36:19Z","rounded_local_amount":822150.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103864761},{"amount":270,"local_amount":820000,"processed_date":"2009-12-26T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T16:39:23Z","rounded_local_amount":822150.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110754570}],"funded_date":"2009-03-19T02:33:39Z","paid_date":"2010-01-15T16:39:23Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Rachel Brooks","image":643421}},{"id":99514,"name":"Elie","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Elis is a 28 year old man who lives in Bint Jbeil, southern Lebanon with his parents.

Despite her young age, she has bought a piece of land on street 47 of Chasquipampa. She stopped working and formed a family and is totally devoted to her household, attending to her son who has had a health problem since birth. To receive revenue in order to get contruction going on her already acquired land, she has decided to supplement her income by starting to mass produce empanadas, berlins, cakes and pastries, without even thinking of the agreable flavor that she makes in the production of the pastries. \r\nThus she began selling small amounts in the south, beginning only with small quantities. Today she sells pastries in two of the schools with the most students in the south, and further prepares these types of dishes in contracts for customers who already know her or know of her pastries. She does this work at home so she can attend to her family in a normal way as she wishes. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Erin Hopkins, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":307818,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bakery","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To build capital.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"La Paz","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.5 -68.15","type":"point"}},"partner_id":110,"posted_date":"2009-05-01T21:00:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jackelline Carmen ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-03-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":2400,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":179.21},{"due_date":"2009-04-27T07:00:00Z","amount":182.75},{"due_date":"2009-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":186.36},{"due_date":"2009-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":190.03},{"due_date":"2009-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":193.78},{"due_date":"2009-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":197.6},{"due_date":"2009-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":201.5},{"due_date":"2009-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":205.48},{"due_date":"2009-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":209.53},{"due_date":"2009-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":213.66},{"due_date":"2009-08-31T07:00:00Z","amount":217.88},{"due_date":"2009-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":222.22}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.13},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.65},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.18},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.71},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.26},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.82},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.39},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.97},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.56},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.16},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.77},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.4}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":135.06,"local_amount":926.13,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T22:31:59Z","rounded_local_amount":948.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44439670},{"amount":58.6,"local_amount":401.81,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T20:08:07Z","rounded_local_amount":411.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52950190},{"amount":30.12,"local_amount":206.55,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T12:56:48Z","rounded_local_amount":211.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63167130},{"amount":93.82,"local_amount":643.06,"processed_date":"2009-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T14:16:23Z","rounded_local_amount":658.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73592588},{"amount":32.4,"local_amount":222.45,"processed_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T15:54:09Z","rounded_local_amount":227.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87027966}],"funded_date":"2009-05-02T05:15:58Z","paid_date":"2009-10-15T15:54:11Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Erin Hopkins","image":null}},{"id":107706,"name":"Leo","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Leo E. makes a living growing rice.

She lives in a house that was willed to her by her parents and she\u2019s very eager to move forward with her life.  It\u2019s been 5-years since she started her dental practice; she had little faith that it would do well, but she worked hard and without rest she set out to achieve these goals.  She maintains her practice always keeping it clean and ensures the highest level of courtesy for her clients.  She very much enjoys her work as she attends to her clients and knows what are the best ways to help people to achieve better health.\r\n<p>\r\nIt took 15-years to learn these skills and she believes the biggest challenge is working these long hours as the office is generally filled with people.

She is aware of the path to her goals is long and requires sacrifice, but she is determined to work hard to achieve them.\r\n<p>\r\nThis is the 5th loan request with MFP and she promises to be punctual with her debt as she does not want to jeopardize things for her community bank members whom she cares for and respects.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n \r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n \r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Mr. Tuvshinbold is professional welder but currently he runs a taxi business, carrying people around Ulaanbaatar city and bringing extra income to the family. He earns around $290 a month from his taxi business. \n\nThe house he built is not complete yet and the entrance, windows and insulation needs to be done. The Mongolian winter is one of the harshest in the world. The temperature in winter time, especially at night, drops to -40 degrees of Celsius. Therefore, the houses should be well-insulated from the cold. Currently most households in Ulaanbaatar city use coal fired stoves for heating which pollutes the air to dangerous level. The Mongolian government takes some measures to improve the air quality by helping to replace coal fired stoves to gas ones and improve the insulation of the houses. Well-insulated houses require less charcoal to burn, emitting less poisonous smoke into the air and helps to save on heating costs of households. \n\nThe loan he is asking for will be used to pay for insulation materials for the walls, double-glazed windows and other building materials to finish the house and to make the house warm and well-insulated from the cold.

She is married to  Djamiou Agbangla and is the mother of two children: the elder is named Latifatou. He is 15 and in the fourth year at the lyc\u00e9e. Her second child is called Jalale; he is 9 and is in the 5th grade in primary school. <P>\r\n\r\nThe needs of Sabitiou's family are covered by her husband. Sabitiou and her family live in Agbodj\u00e8do, an outlying neighborhood near Cotonou, economic capital of B\u00e9nin. Sabitiou came to Cotonou at the age of 15, after having left off schooling. As soon as she arrived, Sabitiou began to sell potatoes, door-to-door, that is to say, she would go from house to house with a tray of potatoes on her head. <P>\r\n\r\nAfter three years, aided by her husband and her parents, Sabitiou diversified her business. Today, she sells vegetables, fruit, drinks, liquid soaps, etc. Sabitiou sells in the center of the city of Cotonou. Most of her clientele is made up of foreigners living in B\u00e9nin (Lebanese, French, Americans, etc.) The demand of her clientele has become quite big and to satisfy it, Sabitiou needs more working capital than she presently has. <P>\r\n \r\nThe word \"Alid\u00e9\" in Fon, the native language of Benin, means \"there is always a way for the poorest\".

Alid\u00e9 offers special 0% interest rate loans to very vulnerable persons and the organization is part of a group which will soon launch a micro-health insurance program to beneficiaries of micro-loans. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Teresa Kramer, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":298169,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"purchase of vegetables, fruit, drinks in cans and bottles, mineral water, liquid soap, etc. ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BJ","country":"Benin","town":"Cotonou Agence principale","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"9.5 2.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":104,"posted_date":"2009-04-03T19:10:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sabitiou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-04-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":180000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":18000},{"due_date":"2009-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":18000},{"due_date":"2009-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":18000},{"due_date":"2009-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":18000},{"due_date":"2009-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":18000},{"due_date":"2009-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":18000},{"due_date":"2009-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":18000},{"due_date":"2009-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":18000},{"due_date":"2010-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":18000},{"due_date":"2010-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":18000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":75,"local_amount":36000,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T20:48:48Z","rounded_local_amount":36508.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44396345},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":18000,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T17:08:14Z","rounded_local_amount":18254.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52904241},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":18000,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T10:26:16Z","rounded_local_amount":18254.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63126275},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":18000,"processed_date":"2009-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T10:52:18Z","rounded_local_amount":18254.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73549706},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":18000,"processed_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T11:13:52Z","rounded_local_amount":18254.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":86983497},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":18000,"processed_date":"2009-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T12:14:06Z","rounded_local_amount":18254.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96895866},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":18000,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T11:09:30Z","rounded_local_amount":18254.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103735447},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":18000,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T11:27:00Z","rounded_local_amount":18254.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110622971},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":18000,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T10:13:48Z","rounded_local_amount":18253.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118019678}],"funded_date":"2009-04-03T23:14:06Z","paid_date":"2010-02-15T10:13:48Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":103626,"name":"Martina Martha","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La Sra Martha tiene 51 a\u00f1os de edad ella cuenta con la actividad de venta de carne, desde hace 38 a\u00f1os, el puesto lo heredo de su mama;

She lives in her own house with her 50-year-old husband Hern\u00e1n and their 3 children: Julio is 21, Roxana is 17, and Hugo is 11. Her children are the motivation for all of her efforts. Her handicraft shop is a very profitable business, since she has several customers who come to her establishment to buy decorations and other items. She starts working very early in the morning and stays in her shop practically all day, since she knows that she has to work very hard to achieve her goals. What Nery likes best about her job is that she can do household tasks at the same time that she is working at her shop. She has been working this way for 12 years and what she likes the least about it is having to stay inside her shop all day without being able to go out into the street. For the future, Nery wants to improve the infrastructure of her shop so that she can provide her customers the service that they deserve. This is her third loan with MFP and she feels the responsibility to pay her dues on time, since she desires access to more loans in the future. In her village bank she is one of the most active partners. With the 2000 nuevos soles that she is asking for she will buy new materials to build more handicrafts to sell and therefore improve her economic gains. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Kelley Maynard, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":347167,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"Purchase materials","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Juliaca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15.5 -70.133333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-07-04T18:40:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":675,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nery","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-06-03T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":333},{"due_date":"2009-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":333},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":333},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":333},{"due_date":"2009-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":333},{"due_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":335}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.39},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.39},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.39},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":112.39},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":112.39},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":113.05}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":112.39,"local_amount":333,"processed_date":"2009-07-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:38:59Z","rounded_local_amount":342.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63211969},{"amount":112.39,"local_amount":333,"processed_date":"2009-08-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:17:53Z","rounded_local_amount":342.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73641497},{"amount":112.39,"local_amount":333,"processed_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:28:32Z","rounded_local_amount":342.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87080936},{"amount":112.39,"local_amount":333,"processed_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T02:58:19Z","rounded_local_amount":342.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96997078},{"amount":112.39,"local_amount":333,"processed_date":"2009-11-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:53:12Z","rounded_local_amount":342.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103842427},{"amount":113.05,"local_amount":335,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:56:44Z","rounded_local_amount":344.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103842428}],"funded_date":"2009-07-05T05:35:10Z","paid_date":"2009-12-15T13:56:44Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kelley Maynard","image":248986}},{"id":124106,"name":"Afiyo","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Cette femme est tr\u00e8s dynamique et vit avec son \u00e9poux et ses trois enfants dans le quartier d\u2019ago\u00e8 cacav\u00e9li.

She is sometimes able to save some money in her bank account.\r\n\r\nAngelica has never taken out a loan with another bank. She found out about Hluvuku [the Kiva Field Partner] through colleagues of hers who also work with the institution. This is her 1st loan, for the amount of 15,500.00 Meticales. She plans to use this money to buy construction materials (zinc plates, cement, a wheelbarrow and other items) in order to start construction on her house.\r\n\r\nShe promises to repay the loan as indicated in order to be eligible for other loans later. In the future she would like to apply for more loans to continue with her home construction project. \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Catherine Fountain, Kiva
