She is 43 years old and is a single mother of three children.  She alone has been in charge of the education, feeding and care of her children.

The couple has five small children: Flor, 8; Charles, 6; Nique, 4; Yahaira, 2; and their last baby, Dicson, who is 2 months old. They live together in their own peaceful house, which is located in the central jungle of Peru. \r\n\r\nAlejandro's work is cultivating coffee, plantains and yucca, but he works as a laborer for other people, since he has not yet been able to acquire his own fields. Each day, he works with great dedication, and his energy does not run out, because he wants his children to have a good education and grow up to pursue a profession. Although it is not his own land that he is working on, he is determined to make it produce abundantly, and for that reason he is well-paid for his work; in addition, he truly enjoys farming. Alejandro is not only hired by other farmers in the countryside, but also by large agricultural companies, who hire him to maintain their plantations.\r\n \r\nHe is a very hard-working man and one dedicated to the soil, and thus his desire is to acquire some plots of land where he can cultivate the products that come from the good earth. He has been saving up for this purpose, and he knows that soon he will be able to reach his goals. \r\n\r\nThis is Alejandro's first loan with MFP, and he has made a commitment to be very responsible with each payment and to make them all on time. He is also very satisfied with the members of his communal bank, since they are people he knows, and he knows they will also be responsible with their payments. With the funds he is requesting, he will purchase his first piece of land, where he will cultivate coffee, plantains and yucca. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Patricia Linderman, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":447487,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Purchasing land for farming","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Chanchamayo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.05 -75.316667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-12-13T04:00:15Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alejandro","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-11-12T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-12T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":350}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":350,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2010-05-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:39:25Z","rounded_local_amount":1004.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144751311}],"funded_date":"2009-12-13T07:14:42Z","paid_date":"2010-06-15T09:39:25Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Patricia Linderman","image":100107}},{"id":165754,"name":"Mar\u00eda Del Carmen","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Mar\u00eda del Carmen Q.

Now, let's get to know this group a little better.  Yulissa and Barbara will share their stories as small businessmen.\r\n\r\nYulissa is 30 years old; working everyday seling bread, cakes, and cookies was difficult since she didn't earn much money.  She sold many of her goods on credit and her customers took a while to pay her.  These difficulties motivated her to change professions and to sell ceviche and chica morada (a local drink) on the corner by her home; this has gone much better for her and she has earned more than she initially thought she would thanks to her good cooking and the fact that there is little competition where she sells.  Currently, she works from a cart that she purchased with loans; she was also able to purchase new utensils, buckets, pots and a display case.  She would like to continue to improve her business by purchasing a mobile kiosk to more easily serve her customers.  She needs a loan to buy it, fix it up, and paint it.  Her earnings help to pay the costs of raising her children as she would like to proviD. for them the best she can.\r\n\r\nBarabara is 57 years old and sells anticuchos (cow heart kebabs) and picarones (fried pork) in a local park.  She has been able to pay for the education of her two children through her business.  She was forced to work when her husband passed away; before that, she had no need to work.  Before she started selling anitcuchos, she sold school supplies but she didn't make much money.  She decided to help her mother selling anticuchos (a Peruvian delicacy).  She will use the loan to buy ingredients like: cow hearts, spices, cow stomach, skewers, etc.  Her youngest son is studying to be a pharmacist; Barbara's brother supports him in his studies because her earnings are only enough to cover his food and their home expenses.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Scott Crandall, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1725,"image":{"id":473490,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Purchase ingredients","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":93,"posted_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:11Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1725,"lender_count":57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Bertha Lucia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elizabeth Noemi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Cristina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Violeta Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gloria Elvira","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Isabel Barbara","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Segura Emilia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Isabel Victoria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Yulissa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Haydee ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-12-21T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":4950,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":1725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":1237.5},{"due_date":"2010-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":1237.5},{"due_date":"2010-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":1237.5},{"due_date":"2010-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1237.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":431.25},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":431.25},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":431.25},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":431.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":862.5,"local_amount":2475,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T09:46:26Z","rounded_local_amount":2479.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123899700},{"amount":431.42,"local_amount":1238,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T08:44:52Z","rounded_local_amount":1240.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128933783},{"amount":431.08,"local_amount":1237,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:08:09Z","rounded_local_amount":1239.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136661376}],"funded_date":"2010-02-04T03:37:04Z","paid_date":"2010-05-15T10:08:09Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Scott Crandall","image":163705}},{"id":174052,"name":"Sabina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sabina A. is currently in the business of selling beans, posho (maize flour) and rice in the market.

It has produced famous thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. A civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged an already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural productivity and the manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent viable business prospects. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

El negocio fue creciendo y por sugerencia de sus clientes empez\u00f3  a comprar mercanc\u00eda en  Maicao, ciudad comercial ubicada en el norte\u00f1o departamento de la Guajira. Actualmente no viaja porque se ha especializado en la venta de calzado y ropa femenina que le proveen directamente algunos talleres en Barranquilla, motivo por el cual sus precios de venta son muy competitivos. La microempresaria atribuye el \u00e9xito de su negocio al hecho de que no s\u00f3lo vende, sino que asesora a todas sus clientas en el estilo de ropa y calzado que deben comprar para verse m\u00e1s elegantes. Algunas, incluso, le consultan su opini\u00f3n cuando compran en almacenes. Este es el segundo cr\u00e9dito que la se\u00f1ora Emilce tramita con la Fundaci\u00f3n  Mario Santo Domingo y su primer Credikiva que planea invertir en la compra de jeans, camisas, pantalones, faldas, calzado y accesorios femeninos. El volumen de venta mensual es de $ 3.000.000 COP, la rentabilidad promedio es del 37% y el plazo de la rotaci\u00f3n de las cuentas por cobrar es de 50 d\u00edas. La microempresaria sue\u00f1a con abrir su propio almac\u00e9n en el cual pueda ofrecer su mercanc\u00eda y hacer con mayor comodidad lo que m\u00e1s le gusta: ser consultora de imagen femenina.","en":"Mrs Emilce Ester Mart\u00ednez lives with her husband and three children in the Las Nieves neighbourhood, one of the most traditional neighbourhoods of the Barranquilla city. She is a merchant of general merchandise. She started selling products to her friends through catalogues 15 years ago to help her husband with some income for their home. The business grew, and on the suggestion of her customers she started buying merchandise in Maicao, a commercial city in the northern department of La Guajira. She currently does not travel because she has specialized in the sales of shoes and women's clothing which are provided directly from various workshops in Barranquilla-this is why her sales prices are very competitive. This businesswoman attributes the success of her business to the fact that she does not just sell, but also advises all of her customers as to which style of clothing and shoes they should buy to be more elegant. Some of them even request her opinion when they buy in department stores. This is the second loan that Mrs Emilce has applied for from la Fundaci\u00f3n  Mario Santo Domingo, and her first loan on Kiva. She plans to invest it in the purchase of jeans, shirts, pants, skirts, shoes and women's accessories. Her monthly sales volume is $ 3.000.000 COP. The expected profitability is 37% and the time to turn over her accounts to cover charges is 50 days. This businesswoman dreams of opening her own store in which she could offer her merchandise and do, with greater comfort, what she most likes: being a woman's image consultant."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":674335,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Products

He thus became a motorcycle taxi driver, but he does not even own the engine he uses for his job. To become self-sufficient, he has decided to buy his own motorcycle and is requesting a loan of $800 to do so.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. Civil war, which ignited soon after independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

She's been selling beverages (soft drinks and beer) from her home for two years, and the business is going well because she's in a bustling area near a park used by a variety of athletes who always need a cold drink. Elevit likes her work a lot because she meets a lot of people and has interesting, engaging conversations. In addition, she uses her earnings to cover her family's expenses, and she's also saving up so she can have a grocery store in the near future. This is her third loan with MFP, and what she likes about working with her group is the level of trust and community among all the members. She will use the money requested to buy some chairs and tables to place outside her house for customers to use.

He lives with his mother and daughter Dayra Elena, who is 13 and attending the 6th grade at primary school.  For the past 9 years, Elvin has worked for the Juigalpa Municipality as a Cleaning Operator.  He is requesting his 2nd loan in order to continue improving his house, as the 1st loan provided just enough funding to repair an interior Plycem wall.

In the future she wants to stay healthy to continue to work and enlarge her home.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ren\u00e9 McConnell, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":593335,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Products Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"irons, toasters, clocks","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Guayaquil (Isla)","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":147,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elsa Mariana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-08-06T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":66.07},{"due_date":"2010-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":75.03},{"due_date":"2010-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":76.07},{"due_date":"2010-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":78.42},{"due_date":"2011-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":79.65},{"due_date":"2011-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":81.5},{"due_date":"2011-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":84.61},{"due_date":"2011-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":85.35},{"due_date":"2011-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":87.61},{"due_date":"2011-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":89.36},{"due_date":"2011-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":91.58},{"due_date":"2011-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":104.75}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.07},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75.03},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":76.07},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":78.42},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.65},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.5},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.61},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.35},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.61},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.36},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.58},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ren\u00e9 McConnell","image":467423}},{"id":231907,"name":"Erlinda","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Erlinda B. is from the village of Mimbunga, Gingoog City.

Su mayor sue\u00f1o y desaf\u00edo es tener un autoservicio, donde las amas de casa y su clientela en general, encuentren todo muy cerca al lugar donde viven, sin tener que transportarse. Con su creciente clientela, su capital de trabajo le resulta insuficiente para lograr sus metas de crecimiento y esta es la raz\u00f3n por la cual acude a su credikiva, primer financiamiento que hace a la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, con el cual comprar\u00e1 v\u00edveres al por mayor para continuar obteniendo descuentos por las compras en volumen y sobre todo de contado. Mientras Marcelina se esfuerza trabajando, genera un margen de utilidad, no menor del 38%, lo que le permite potencialmente seguir creciendo al inyectarle capital de trabajo a su negocio, producto de cr\u00e9ditos.\n\n","en":"Marcelina is 44 years old and lives in the town of Soledad with her five children who range in age from 23 to 3 years old.  She has a store there named \"Tienda donde Diove\", which she started at the recommendation of her aunt.  Marcelina invested her settlement in an independent activity that would produce income that would support her household.  This was how she launched her new adventure, which has allowed her to get ahead as a female head of household.  Marcelina identifies herself as a female fighter and she never gives up when faced with life's adversities.  This is her motivation to continue, so that every day she is even braver.  \r\n\r\nHer biggest dream and challenge is to have a supermarket where housewives and her customers in general will find everything very close to where they live, without having to travel.  With her growing customer base, her working capital is not sufficient to meet her goals of growth, so that is why she is asking for this Kiva loan.  It is her first loan with the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  With this loan, she will purchase supplies at wholesale to continue receiving discounts for buying in bulk and paying in cash.  While Marcelina works hard, she generates a profit margin not less than 38%, which potentially allows her to continue growing and investing capital in her business, a product of loans.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":856193,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to purchase supplies at wholesale.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Soledad-Atlantico","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2011-08-27T19:20:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":575,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marcelina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-08-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":74909},{"due_date":"2011-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":76345},{"due_date":"2011-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":77808},{"due_date":"2011-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":79300},{"due_date":"2012-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":80820},{"due_date":"2012-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":82369},{"due_date":"2012-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":83947},{"due_date":"2012-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":85556},{"due_date":"2012-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":87196},{"due_date":"2012-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":88867},{"due_date":"2012-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":90571},{"due_date":"2012-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":92312}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.07},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.9},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.74},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.6},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.47},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.36},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.27},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.2},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.13},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.1},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.08},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.08}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":43.07,"local_amount":74909,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:06:52Z","rounded_local_amount":76583.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232803748},{"amount":43.9,"local_amount":76345,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:16:54Z","rounded_local_amount":78051.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238614819},{"amount":44.74,"local_amount":77808,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:59:30Z","rounded_local_amount":79547.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244568775},{"amount":45.6,"local_amount":79300,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:07:27Z","rounded_local_amount":81072.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250780099},{"amount":46.47,"local_amount":80820,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T10:21:49Z","rounded_local_amount":82626.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257188494},{"amount":47.36,"local_amount":82369,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:35:36Z","rounded_local_amount":84209.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263324711},{"amount":48.27,"local_amount":83947,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T09:31:49Z","rounded_local_amount":85823.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270038769},{"amount":49.2,"local_amount":85556,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:42:43Z","rounded_local_amount":87468.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276650931},{"amount":50.13,"local_amount":87196,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T15:56:50Z","rounded_local_amount":89144.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283140534},{"amount":156.26,"local_amount":271750,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:10:04Z","rounded_local_amount":277823.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287100466}],"funded_date":"2011-08-30T17:29:37Z","paid_date":"2012-07-15T09:10:04Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Eileen Lloyd","image":721623}},{"id":334367,"name":"Gracelda","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Gracelda is 47 years old and lives in Canal, Siquijor, Siquijor.

Amidst the daily necessities every grocery store provides--staple foods, soda, cleaners, utensils--Fel\u00edcitas has dedicated an entire wall to children\u2019s toys. There are stuffed animals, dolls, games, costumes, and anything else a small child\u2019s heart desires. Fel\u00edcitas says the neighborhood children always stop by for candy or for a birthday present on their way to a \u201ccumplea\u00f1os,\u201d or birthday. \r\n\r\n<p>For four years, Fel\u00edcitas has owned and maintained her grocery store in a pleasant neighborhood just outside of the city center of Ayacucho, Peru. Years before, and for the majority of her professional life, Fel\u00edcitas rented a store in downtown Ayacucho, where she sold children\u2019s clothing. Though she greatly enjoyed her work selling clothing, it was very expensive to rent space in the city, and Fel\u00edcitas preferred to buy her own place to run her own, more independent business. Today, this is exactly what she does. After switching from selling clothing to groceries, a more practical market in her current neighborhood, Fel\u00edcitas now spends every single day behind the store counter. She arrives at 5:00 a.m. each morning to begin selling fresh bread for breakfast and doesn\u2019t leave until 9 p.m. that evening. It is tiring, she admits, but also very rewarding, and she does get the occasional break when one of her six grown children stop by to take over the counter from time to time. \r\n\r\n<p>Within her village bank, Fel\u00edcitas is extremely happy. She loves that is a place where she can spend time with her friends, laughing and chatting, while at the same time getting down to business, paying loans, and accomplishing goals. Through the loans she receives from her village bank, Fel\u00edcitas is always looking for ways to increase business and attract new customers.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n\r\nTajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Vive en una casa propia con su esposa y dos hijos. Es un productor de leche desde hace tres a\u00f1os. Anteriormente se dedicaba con su familia al ganado de engorde (carne) pero poco a poco ha ido cambiando al ganado de leche lo cual le ha ayudado a sacar adelante a su familia.\nDon Olman vive en El Sauce de Santa Teresita de Turrialba. Es una peque\u00f1a comunidad rural de unos dos mil habitantes. Sus pobladores se dedican principalmente a la producci\u00f3n de leche y siembra de caf\u00e9. Tiene un relieve irregular y mucho del terreno se mantiene como bosque tropical h\u00famedo. La comunidad tiene paisajes muy pintorescos que combinan el bosque tropical con dos lindas lagunas, plantaciones de caf\u00e9 y lecher\u00edas. \nEl Sauce se localiza aproximadamente a hora y media en bus de Turrialba, el centro de comercio m\u00e1s cercano, sin embargo varias veces al a\u00f1o, el camino se vuelve intransitable por las lluvias que caen en la zona. Este es sin duda uno de los principales desaf\u00edos para la comunidad. Cuando no exist\u00edan actividades muchas personas optaron por salir a buscar trabajos en Turrialba o en fincas bananeras ubicadas en el Atl\u00e1ntico de Costa Rica. Actualmente los precios del caf\u00e9 y la leche han mejorado por lo tanto los vecinos buscan c\u00f3mo invertir en proyectos en la misma zona.\nDon Olman comenz\u00f3 sembrando un peque\u00f1o sector de su finca con pastos para picar y as\u00ed darle un mejor alimento a sus vacas de leche. Su idea es ir mejorando la calidad del alimento que da a sus vacas para producir m\u00e1s leche. Adem\u00e1s quiere mantener los costos bajos utilizando alimentos que puede producir en la misma finca en lugar de tener que comprar concentrados u otros alimentos m\u00e1s caros. Actualmente el pasto lo corta y pica a mano utilizando un machete.\nDon Olman desea sacar un pr\u00e9stamo de \u00a2500.000 ($900) para comprar m\u00e1s semilla de pasto y una m\u00e1quina para picar pasto. \u00c9l dice que si logra tener m\u00e1s alimento para el ganado dentro de la misma finca podr\u00e1 mejorar el rendimiento actual y as\u00ed tener m\u00e1s ganancias. El pr\u00e9stamo lo va a sacar pensando en mejorar la calidad de vida de sus dos hijos y su esposa. S\u00ed hay m\u00e1s ingresos se beneficia toda la familia.\nDon Olman es cliente de la Asociaci\u00f3n de Productores de El Sauce, una organizaci\u00f3n local socia de la microfinanciera EDESA. Gracias a su vinculaci\u00f3n con esta organizaci\u00f3n ha obtenido ya cuatro  pr\u00e9stamos y todos los ha cancelado satisfactoriamente. El cuenta que al principio no ten\u00eda terreno ni vacas pero que a trav\u00e9s de su vinculaci\u00f3n con la organizaci\u00f3n ha ido sacando pr\u00e9stamos que ha ido pagando y as\u00ed a cambiado su vida y que ahora \u00e9l se considera un microempresario.\n","en":"Don Olman Quesada V. is 35 years old; he lives in his own house with his wife and two children. He has been producing milk for three years. Previously, he and his family were raised cattle, but little by little he has shifted to dairy, which has helped him to move his family forward. \r\n\r\nDon Olman lives in El Sauce de Santa Teresita in Turrialba. It's a small rural community of 2,000 residents. The settlers all work mainly in milk production and coffee planting.  It has a rugged terrain and much of the ground is damp tropical forest. The community has very picturesque scenery: tropical forest combined with two pretty lakes, coffee plantations, and dairy farms. El Sauce is located about 1.5 hours by bus from Turrialba, the closest commercial center, however several times a year, the road becomes impassable from the rains that fall in the region. This is without doubt one of the main challenges for the community. When there were not a lot of activities, many people opted to leave and search for work in Turrialba or on banana farms located on the Atlantic in Costa Rica. Presently, the price of coffee and milk has improved, hence the neighbors are looking to invest in projects in their own region. \r\n\r\nDon Olman started planting a small area of his farm with pasture which has given him better food for his dairy cows. Moreover, he wants to keep his costs low by using food that he can produce on his own farm instead of needing to buy extract and other food that is more expensive. Presently, his grass is cut and picked by hand using a machete. Don Olman wants to take out of loan of \u00a2500.000 ($900) to buy more grass seed and a machine to pick the grass.  He says he will achieve more food for the cows within his own farm and he will be able to improve his output and make more money. The loan he is going to take will improve the quality of life of his two children and his wife. If there are more earnings, it benefits the whole family.\r\n\r\nDon Olman is a client of the Association of Producers of El Sauce, a local organization that partners with the microfinance institution EDESA.  Thanks to his connection with this organization, he has already received four loans, and all have been repaid satisfactorily. When Don Olman started he had no land or cows, but through his connection to the organization he has taken loans and repaid them, and this has changed his life, so that now he is considered a micro-entrepreneur. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Cara Gutterman, Kiva

Garilao, Brgy. Guintubhan Isabela Negros Occidental, is 54 years old, and married to Pedro E.. He is 58 years old and helps her in run the business. They are blessed with four children who are 22 to 30 years old. They have already finished their college education, earned their degrees and are gainfully employed. This makes Elena and Pedro happy because in spite of the hardships they went through, having their children become professionals is quite an achievement.\r\n\r\nElena and her husband sell vegetables and spices, moving to each town that is having their market day.  They travel very early in the morning so that they arrive at the location early enough to set up before the customers come to the market. This is not an easy business because a lot of unexpected things could happen, like holdups, accidents, losses due to damage and others. Because of her dream to improve their living and send all children to school, they never minded the difficulties but instead focused on the future. They continued to sustain their business and whatever income they got they used to pay for the education of their children and the family expenses. When they learned that there was an available space for rent at the Isabela Public Market, they grabbed the opportunity to have a permanent place to sell their vegetables, spices and some basic household commodities that are in demand with the locals.\r\n\r\nThe need for fresh capital to expand her business prodded her to join NWTF-Project Dungganon. In the five years that she has been a member of NWTF-PD, she developed her business and improved the living status of her family. Now she earns PHP 15,000 per month, a big amount that could satisfactorily sustain their needs and prepare for their future when they grow old. For now, she maintains her good credit performance in NWTF-PD because she wants to get bigger loans in the future.\r\n\r\nHer previous loan of PHP 17,000 was used as additional working capital for her business. The loan was fully paid without any delay. Now she wants to borrow for her 9th cycle PHP 19,500 for her business. Whatever income there is will be used for the expansion of the business and for their future.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the calling of not just a few but thousands of women. Through the alleviation program, these women have progressed from earning less than a measly $1 a day, to surpassing the realities beyond their dreams. They have learned to live a life where they can finally be called honorable. This is Project Dungganon. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":406692,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits &

She regularly attends their weekly fellowship meetings and pays her weekly dues consistently. Because of her good repayment performance with her previous loans, she was able to borrow ten times in CCT\u2019s Cooperative. She is consistent in paying her dues because she used the money she borrows to buy inventory for her variety store. Her business allows her to earn a profit of PHP 4,300 per month.  \r\n\r\nNow with your help, she would like to apply for a PHP 18,000 loan. This amount will be used as a source of added capital to her expanding business by buying added inventory for her store.\r\n\r\nShe dreams that her business will earn more so that she can send her children to school until they graduate from college. \r\n\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners.

But there\u2019s nothing to compare to the paintings which are in most demand.  She earns from 120 to 150 soles per 1 meter x 1 meter painting and even more during Holy Week.  She enjoys what she does.\r\n\r\nEsther wants to set up a stand in her district\u2019s civic center but to do so she has to invest in the purchase of shelving, containers, and display cases as well as to rent the locale.  Esther is a faithful MFP client; she\u2019s been working in three cycles of group loans where she\u2019s done marvelously.  This would be her first individual loan and she states that she will be punctual with her payments like she\u2019s been to date.

Q. belongs to a village bank called \u201cBonanza.\u201d<P>\r\n\r\nHaydee earns her living making and marketing beautiful handicrafts (artesan\u00edas). The majority of her works are \u201ctejidos al telar\u201d which are crafts such as tapestries and carpets woven on a loom. Haydee says her specialty is in \u201cartesan\u00edas finas,\u201d which are very complex pieces stitched onto processed fabric. Together with her husband she owns a shop called \u201cQory Qayto,\u201d which is Quechua (their native language) for \u201cThread of Gold.\u201d Their clients, mostly foreigners, contract with them for specific projects which Haydee and her husband help design. The time it takes to complete one piece can range from one day for a simple tapestry to more than two weeks for large and elaborate orders.  <P>\r\n\r\nTo supplement their income and support their two children, ages 7 and 19, every Sunday Haydee prepares several dishes such as \u201cceviche,\u201d Peru\u2019s national dish of fresh raw fish soaked in lime juice, which she sells in the local market.

Aware of the needs of his family, Yuldosh requested and received a loan from IMON International a year ago. He used the loan to buy seeds and mineral fertilizer for his harvest.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n\r\n<p>Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.<p> \r\n\r\n<p>IMON's History<p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Their school was built in 1985 to help educate the children of Makeni city and its surrounding villages. The school has a total of twelve staff and 450 pupils.\n\nTeachers are one of the lowest paid workers in Sierra Leone. Because of this, many of them find other additional means of making a living. Some engage in businesses or agriculture and others organized extra classes for the pupils (though this is a practice the government is trying to abolish). Teachers therefore seek a loan in order to embark on meaningful projects and then, out of their monthly salaries, they gradually repay the loan.\n\nMabel C. (second from right) is a senior teacher at the school and head of this group. She is age forty-five. She was born in Matamp village in the Tonkolili district, in northern Sierra Leone. She is married to a teacher and they have four children together. One of her children is already a grown-up and training as a lab technician, while two others (the twins) are in Junior Secondary School III (JSS III) and the last is in JSS I.\n\nMabel has been a teacher for over twenty-five years now. She will use this loan to buy a piece of land for the purpose of constructing a house. Buying a plot of land will improve her life, she told me. With subsequent loans, and with the little she has and will be saving, she will be able to build her house. She needs a home for her children and for her old

In order to increase the stock of her materials and broaden her commercial activity, Rosine is asking for a third loan from ALID\u00e9.\r\n\r\n <br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Chloe Tuot, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":561608,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Purchasing condiments (peppers, onion, fresh tomatoes, crushed peppers, etc) ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BJ","country":"Benin","town":"Cotonou Agence principale","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"9.5 2.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":104,"posted_date":"2010-06-29T13:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":300,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosine ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-06-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":150000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2010-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2010-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2010-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2010-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2010-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2011-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2011-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2011-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2011-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":15000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":30,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T09:10:16Z","rounded_local_amount":15893.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159576231},{"amount":30,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-30T08:14:51Z","rounded_local_amount":15893.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166954745},{"amount":30,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-30T08:50:59Z","rounded_local_amount":15893.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172056400},{"amount":30,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-03T10:26:33Z","rounded_local_amount":15893.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177347935},{"amount":30,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T12:28:45Z","rounded_local_amount":15893.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182482962},{"amount":33,"local_amount":16500,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-05T09:07:23Z","rounded_local_amount":17482.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188617778},{"amount":30,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-27T09:14:26Z","rounded_local_amount":15893.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191361154},{"amount":39,"local_amount":19500,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-28T09:13:25Z","rounded_local_amount":20661.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195779853},{"amount":39.82,"local_amount":19911,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-16T08:08:25Z","rounded_local_amount":21096.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201401659},{"amount":8.18,"local_amount":4089,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T10:03:41Z","rounded_local_amount":4332.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206089350}],"funded_date":"2010-06-29T14:51:27Z","paid_date":"2011-05-15T10:03:41Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Chlo\u00e9 Tuot","image":1210498}},{"id":215551,"name":"Maximiliana","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Maximiliana de 61 a\u00f1os de edad, vive solo con sus hijos  Richard de 41, An\u00edbal de 23, Carlos de 39, y Revelino de 31 a\u00f1os de edad, pues es viuda.

After moving to the United States in the early '70s, Soo knew that, with her experience in the dry cleaning business, she would one day open up her own storefront. With the help of their two children, their dry cleaning business became a staple in their community.\r\n\r\nWith the economic recession, Soo\u2019s business suffered from increased prices. With increases in oil, supplies and energy resources, Soo was forced to increase prices in her store. However, with strategic cutbacks and determination, her business was able to keep its doors open. \r\n\r\nToday, Soo has her third loan with ACCION USA. This loan will allow her to buy a new dry cleaning machine. Without this machine, Soo was forced to send many of her clients to a different dry cleaning business. This loan will allow her to retain more of the clients that come into her store and offer more specialized services.\r\n\r\nSoo and her husband dream of eventually opening a dry cleaning business in Manhattan. With the confidence of having weathered the worst of the economic crisis, Soo is optimistic about their business\u2019s future. Soo says her greatest success with owning her own business has been sending her eldest son to a university in New York. \r\n\r\n<b>About U.S. Microfinance and ACCION USA<\/b>\r\nHave you ever thought about how the cute new caf\u00e9 on your corner or the salon you frequent every month got the financial resources to start their business? Chances are, they drummed up support from their friends and family, dipped into their personal savings, used a high-interest credit card, or all of the above. An estimated ten million small businesses in the U.S. face difficulty obtaining loans from traditional banks, even prior to the current \u201ccredit crisis\u201d. Microfinance institutions, like ACCION USA, support these \u201cunbanked\u201d small businesses by giving them access to fairly-priced capital and business education.\r\n\r\nSmall businesses also help stabilize low- to moderate-income neighborhoods and rebuild the economy through income growth and job creation. Self-employment provides workers with a way to increase their incomes, support their families, and strengthen their communities. As unemployment rises in the U.S., more and more people are turning to self-employment and start-up enterprises as a way to take control of their economic futures and provide employment opportunities in their communities. The need for support of small businesses in the U.S. is great, and it is one that ACCION USA has been striving to meet since 1991.

He has an excellent location, surrounded by big state-owned and private companies, and on a main route where many people pass by on their way to the commercial centre. His idea for the business began 38 years ago, when he arrived in Barranquilla and started working for various companies. Eventually he responded to his independent streak and put into action his dream of having a small business preparing delicious natural orange juice. With this business he has succeeded in providing for his family and contributing, along with his wife, who is employed in domestic service, to the education of his three children who are now aged between 23 and 30. Above all, he has succeeded in keeping their own roof over their heads. Sixto's Kiva loan is his first loan with field partner Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, an organisation that was recommended to him by a friend who is also a client of the field partner. With the money he will buy oranges and also raw materials, in bulk, for making fries, which he would like ot add as a new product in his range. At the same time he will pay off other loans that have become very costly. Sixto's main goal is to help his wife sert up a shop  in thier home, where she will be able to earn money for the family's expenses so she can become independent and not have to keep working as a maid. The main challenge in his business is inclement weather, especially when it rains. This reduces the number of customers and his sales, because as an outdoor salesman he has to take shelter.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":610784,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To buy oranges and ingredients in bulk for making fries, and also to repay a costly, informally arranged, debt.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2010-10-05T20:10:11Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":450,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sixto Tom\u00e0s","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":800000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":72317},{"due_date":"2010-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":74726},{"due_date":"2011-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":76158},{"due_date":"2011-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":77618},{"due_date":"2011-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":79105},{"due_date":"2011-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":80622},{"due_date":"2011-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":82167},{"due_date":"2011-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":83742},{"due_date":"2011-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":85347},{"due_date":"2011-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":88198}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.68},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.03},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.84},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.66},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.5},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.35},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.22},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.1},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.01},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.61}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":82.71,"local_amount":147043,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T14:08:34Z","rounded_local_amount":149211.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182550783},{"amount":86.5,"local_amount":153776,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T03:38:58Z","rounded_local_amount":156044.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191427610},{"amount":44.5,"local_amount":79105,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-16T08:40:23Z","rounded_local_amount":80271.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":196001031},{"amount":45.35,"local_amount":80622,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:09:10Z","rounded_local_amount":81811.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201289042},{"amount":46.22,"local_amount":82167,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:05:02Z","rounded_local_amount":83378.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206157192},{"amount":47.1,"local_amount":83742,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:08:46Z","rounded_local_amount":84977.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216509072},{"amount":48.01,"local_amount":85347,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:49:35Z","rounded_local_amount":86605.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221673299},{"amount":49.61,"local_amount":88198,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-17T08:02:16Z","rounded_local_amount":89498.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227319863}],"funded_date":"2010-10-06T17:53:33Z","paid_date":"2011-09-17T08:02:16Z","journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Rosa Oswald","image":null}},{"id":240140,"name":"Susana","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Susana M. is a 47-year-old married woman who supports her family by operating two business ventures: renting out <i>trisikad<\/i> transport and a food-vending business.

Her husband works as a driver and helps her with household expenses, and her daughter also work and help with the bills. Maria is a merchant and at the same time has been making a living as a farmer for the past 30 years. The biggest problem she has is a lack funding, which doesn't allow her to get a good yield from her crops because she can't afford enough planting supplies. Maria's dream is to be able to expand her crops so she can better help her children and provide them with a better future. With the loan she is requesting she plans to purchase fertilizer and insecticide for her crops and hopefully achieve a better yield.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

To make a living, Delia owns & operates a business selling food. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from selling vegetables to the local community.

Delia has successfully repaid a previous loan of 9000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used for working capital and to purchase additional inventory. Delia is requesting a new loan of 10000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be her 4th loan from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines.

They live in a house belonging to a nephew. She is an older person but she has the will to improve, which is why she has decided to set up a food stall near the university in El Salvador. She gets help by her life partner to make the breakfast and lunch foods that are sold to the students at the university. It is hard work but it is the only source of income for their household and it is the way they are able to provide for all of their needs. This loan will be used to purchase ingredients such as rice, beans, corn, some vegetables, soft drinks, and snacks. They will also carry out some improvements to their small stand. It is made of aluminum sheeting and they want to expand the stall as their earnings grow.

He has been active in mixed farming for the past three years, producing and selling eggs, tomatoes and onions to the local market.\r\n\r\nJohn has requested a loan of 31,200 KES to purchase and insure a dairy cow. This will be his second loan with Juhudi Kilimo.

With this experience, Merys began her business venture four years ago with a small amount of merchandise, distributing it on credit to her initial market of family, neighbors, and friends.  Gradually her growing clientele began to recognize her and ask her for clothing, small electric appliances, and so on, and from there she expanded her range a little.  At present Merys sells on credit in terms agreed upon individually with her customers; she recovers her money weekly, twice a month, and monthly, in accordance with each agreement.\n\nHer Kiva loan is her first funding from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  Merys will buy curtains, fans, blenders, and merchandise that has been ordered, and with this investment she would be increasing her working capital.  Her long-term dream is to have a store for selling wholesale and, with her earnings, educate her son at a level of quality that fulfills her objective to help him be successful.  In the meantime, Merys is working on her business managing a liquidity of 16 to 1, or better said, for every 1 Colombian peso she has 16 in reserve, and, from this point, with the injection of working capital from her Kiva loan, she is planning her future growth.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":856348,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy curtains, fans, blenders, and merchandise that has been ordered.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"San Jacinto-Bol\u00edvar","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2011-09-05T19:40:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":625,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Merys De Jesus","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-08-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1070000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":98093},{"due_date":"2011-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":99973},{"due_date":"2011-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":101889},{"due_date":"2011-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":103842},{"due_date":"2012-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":105832},{"due_date":"2012-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":107861},{"due_date":"2012-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":109928},{"due_date":"2012-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":112035},{"due_date":"2012-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":114182},{"due_date":"2012-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":116365}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.3},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.39},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.52},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.65},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":61.82},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.21},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.44},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.7},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.97}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":57.3,"local_amount":98093,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:05:57Z","rounded_local_amount":101874.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232803771},{"amount":58.39,"local_amount":99973,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:17:42Z","rounded_local_amount":103827.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238614841},{"amount":59.52,"local_amount":101889,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-26T08:50:07Z","rounded_local_amount":105816.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244568795},{"amount":61.14,"local_amount":104668,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:07:24Z","rounded_local_amount":108703.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250780118},{"amount":62.87,"local_amount":107636,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T10:21:46Z","rounded_local_amount":111785.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257188513},{"amount":69.12,"local_amount":118329,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:35:17Z","rounded_local_amount":122890.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263324729},{"amount":59.89,"local_amount":102538,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T09:31:01Z","rounded_local_amount":106490.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270038786},{"amount":81.76,"local_amount":139975,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:44:16Z","rounded_local_amount":145371.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276650948},{"amount":113.01,"local_amount":193469,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T15:56:16Z","rounded_local_amount":200927.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283140553},{"amount":2,"local_amount":3430,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:10:05Z","rounded_local_amount":3562.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287100482}],"funded_date":"2011-09-17T16:02:10Z","paid_date":"2012-07-15T09:10:05Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Catharine Wall","image":1532414}},{"id":334415,"name":"Chenda","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Chenda, 42 years old, is a housewife.

di ladang, sedangkan sekarang penjualan hasil pertanian turun drastic karena musim kamarau dan harga pupuk yang mahal. Oleh sebab itu Ni Nengah Weli berusaha untuk mendukung pendapatan suami dengan menjalankan usaha beternak babi. Namun usaha ini dijalankan masih secara tradisional dengan cara mengikat babinya pada sebatang pohon, hal ini dilakukan karena Ni Nengah Weli tidak mempunyai modal untuk membuat kandang. Kemudian Ni Nengah Weli mengajukan pinjaman ke Yayasan Dinari, karena selain mendapatkan pinjaman modal, Dinari juga memberikan pelatihan yang berkaitan dengan pemeliharaan babi agar nantinya mendapatkan hasil yang bagus. Modal pinjaman ini akan dipergunakan untuk membuat kandang babi dan membeli  pakan ternak sampai nanti babi ini siap dijual. Dengan adanya usaha ini diharapkan  dapat meningkatkan perekonomian keluarga dan anak \u2013anak mereka tetap bisa bersekolah. Sesuai dengan program Dinari bahwa pinjaman ini akan dilunasi setelah akhir periode pinjaman selama 6 bulan.","en":"Ni Nengah Weli a homemaker helps her husband in the crop field everyday, but recently income from the sale of crops dropped drastically due to the dry season and the high price of fertilizer.  Due to that Ni Nengah Weli make an effort to supplement her husband\u2019s income by carrying out pig farming.  However, this effort is still done in the traditional way where the pig is leased to a tree, the reason that this is done is because Ni Nengah Weli does not have the funds to build a pigpen.  Thus Ni Nengah Weli submit loan request from Dinari Foundation, because beside receiving loan, Dinari also provides training relating to proper pig farming so that later generate good returns.  This funding loan will be used to fund building the pigpen and purchase livestock supplies until the pigs are ready for sale.  With this effort hopefully will improve the family\u2019s financial condition and their children have a consistent education.  In line with Dinari\u2019s program this loan will be repaid at the end of 6 months.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Indonesian by Pheng Tan, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":228533,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Build pigpen and purchase livestock supplies (Membuat kandang babi dan membeli pakan)","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Melaya, Bali","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":82,"posted_date":"2008-11-25T19:50:12Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":450,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ni Nengah Weli","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-11-06T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"IDR","disbursal_amount":5000000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":5000000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":450}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":450,"local_amount":5000000,"processed_date":"2009-05-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T22:29:18Z","rounded_local_amount":5023350,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44434578}],"funded_date":"2008-12-01T03:31:43Z","paid_date":"2009-06-15T22:29:18Z","journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Pheng Tan","image":null}},{"id":79535,"name":"Luz","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":" \nLa dama Luz N. desde hace varios a\u00f1os se ha destacado por ser una excelente costurera teniendo su establecimiento en el municipio de Ciudad Sandino en la ciudad de Managua.\n\nSe ha destacado debido a que ha aprendido a elaborar todo tipo de trajes as\u00ed como camisas, pantalones, blusas, etc. La situaci\u00f3n que hoy en d\u00eda ella est\u00e1 atravesando es que necesita el material de trabajo para continuar y este material es tijeras, hilos, telas, agujas, cent\u00edmetros, etc. Por esta raz\u00f3n espera que Ceprodel le beneficie con un cr\u00e9dito para la compra de estos materiales y para beneficio propio en su negocio.\n\n","en":"For several years Luz N. has been well known for being an excellent seamstress.

R. es un  joven se\u00f1or de 21 a\u00f1os de edad, soltero y vive  actualmente solo con su madre, su padrastro y sus dos hermanos.\n\nLa comunidad en la cual vive Jos\u00e9 Eduardo se llama El Sauce de Santa Teresita de Turrialba, Provincia de Cartago.  Es una peque\u00f1a comunidad rural de aproximadamente dos mil habitantes. Sus pobladores se dedican a la producci\u00f3n de leche y siembra de caf\u00e9. Tiene un relieve irregular y mucho del terreno se mantiene como bosque tropical h\u00famedo. La comunidad tiene paisajes muy pintorescos que combinan el bosque tropical con dos lindas lagunas, plantaciones de caf\u00e9 y lecher\u00edas. El Sauce se localiza aproximadamente a hora y media en bus de Turrialba, el centro de comercio m\u00e1s cercano. Sin embargo, varias veces al a\u00f1o el camino se vuelve intransitable por las lluvias que azotan la zona. Este es sin duda uno de los principales desaf\u00edos para la comunidad. \nCuando no exist\u00edan actividades muchas personas optaron por salir a buscar trabajos en Turrialba o en fincas bananeras ubicadas en la Zona Atl\u00e1ntica de Costa Rica. Actualmente los precios del caf\u00e9 y la leche han mejorado, por lo tanto los vecinos buscan c\u00f3mo invertir en proyectos en la misma zona y de esta forma evitar migrar.\n\nComo parte de las respuestas a esa situaci\u00f3n, desde hace dos a\u00f1os se instal\u00f3 en la comunidad una planta de elaboraci\u00f3n de quesos, propiedad de la Asociaci\u00f3n de Productores de Leche de El Sauce, hecho que motiv\u00f3 a Jos\u00e9 Eduardo  a iniciar en la producci\u00f3n de leche para luego venderla a esta planta. \n\nAsegura que su familia  se ha dedicado a esta actividad durante mucho tiempo, por lo que ha podido experimentar todos los cuidados que demanda, adem\u00e1s de la instrucci\u00f3n recibida por parte de sus familiares  a lo largo del tiempo. \nEl queso de la regi\u00f3n donde vive Jos\u00e9 Eduardo es famoso en todo Costa Rica. Es un queso fresco que se le conoce tradicionalmente como \u201cqueso tipo Turrialba\u201d. A los \u201cticos\u201d (como se les conoce a los habitantes de Costa Rica) les gusta mucho consumir este producto; se le encontrar\u00e1 en las mesas acompa\u00f1ando cualquier tipo de comida.  Por esta raz\u00f3n, el mercado para dicho producto es realmente bueno.\n\nJos\u00e9 Eduardo desea obtener un micro cr\u00e9dito de \u00a2500,000 (quinientos mil colones) para comprar una vaca lechera y poder iniciar con su negocio ya que desea ser un microempresario exitoso y  as\u00ed poder ayudar a que su familia siga adelante esto es una de las cosas que lo motiva a esforzarse y trabajar con mucho esmero. \n\nJos\u00e9 Eduardo es socio de la Asociaci\u00f3n de Productores de El Sauce, una de las 100 organizaciones socias de EDESA en Costa Rica. Este ser\u00e1 su primer pr\u00e9stamo y con \u00e9l espera continuar creciendo a nivel personal y econ\u00f3mico. Tambi\u00e9n destaca que gracias a este tipo de organizaciones y medios facilitadores de cr\u00e9dito puede dedicar m\u00e1s tiempo a las actividades productivas. \n","en":"Jos\u00e9 Eduardo Z. R. is a young gentleman of 21 years of age, single and currently lives with his mother, stepfather and two brothers. \r\n\r\nThe community where he lives is called El Sauce de Santa Teresita of Turrialba, Cartago Province. It is a small rural community of about two thousand inhabitants. They are engaged in milk production and coffee planting. It has an   irregular topography and is kept as a moist tropical forest. The community has very picturesque landscapes that combine the beautiful tropical forest gaps with coffee plantations and dairy farms.\r\nEl sauce is located about an hour and a half by bus from Turrialba, the nearest trading center. However, several times a year the road becomes impassable due to the rains that hit the area. This is undoubtedly one of the main challenges for the community. When there were no activities many people chose to leave to look for work in Turrialba or at banana plantations located in the Atlantic zone of Costa Rica. Currently the prices of coffee and milk have improved, so the neighbors look how to invest in projects in the same area and in this way avoid migration. \r\n\r\nAs part of the response to this situation, a cheese processing plant was established since two years ago. It is owned by the Milk Producers' Association of El Sauce, which motivated Jos\u00e9 Eduardo to start in milk production and sell it to this plant. \r\n\r\nHis family has been in this activity for long time, so he has experienced all the care it demands, in addition to the instruction given by their family members over time. \r\nThe cheese from the region where Jos\u00e9 Eduardo lives is famous throughout Costa Rica. It is a fresh cheese that is traditionally known as \"cheese type Turrialba\u201d. For the \"Ticos\" (as the people of Costa Rica are known), they love to consume this product, you'll find in the tables accompanying any kind of food. For this reason, the market for this product is really good. \r\n\r\nJos\u00e9 Eduardo wants to obtain a micro loan of \u00a2 500,000 (five hundred thousand colones) to buy a cow and be able to start his business and be a successful micro-business owner and help his family to keep going, this is one of the things that motivates him to strive and work very hard. \r\n\r\nJos\u00e9 Eduardo is a member of the Association of Producers of El Sauce, one of 100 partner organizations of EDESA in Costa Rica. This will be his first loan, and he hopes to continue to grow personally and financially. He also stays that with this type of organizations and facilitators of credit he can spend more time on productive activities.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Adriana Pierce, Kiva

Since she was 13 years old, she has dedicated herself to tending to her small grocery store, where she offers packets of snacks, sweets, drinks, and other products to settle her expenses since she works alone.  She likes the attention because it allows her to make friends and converse with the people that arrive at her grocery store.  Since she is located close to a well-traveled highway, many drivers and passengers stop to have a drink to refresh themselves and a sandwich to satiate their hunger.  Mar\u00eda considers her business to be profitable because she always has good clientele.  She thinks in the near future she will have a bigger store with essential products and in this way satisfy the growing needs of her clients.

Cuando tiene que cosechar sus propias siembras se levanta a las 3 de la ma\u00f1ana para cocinar los alimentos y posteriormente procede a la recolecci\u00f3n de las arvejas, para que en la tarde ya est\u00e9n listas para llevarlas al mercado de la ciudad, donde generalmente obtiene un buen precio, y eso la hace muy feliz y la motiva a seguir sembrando.

","en":"Do\u00f1a Nora, aged 37, is married and the mother of four children. They live in their own house. She is a very quiet and hard-working lady who has worked in agriculture since a very young age. Now that she is a mother, she has learned to organize her time and take care both of her home and her farm. \r\n<p>\r\nAs Nora works with her husband, they finish early and she has enough time left to work on her neighbors' farms, where she usually turns over the earth and harvests peas. She earns 13 nuevos soles (US$4.40) a day for this work, but she prefers to be paid depending on the amount of harvested peas, as this motivates her to pick as many peas as possible. When she has to harvest her own crop, she gets up at 3 a.m. to prepare the meals and then pick peas. In the afternoon of the same day, she sells her peas at the city market where she can usually get a good price for them. This makes her very happy and motivates her for a new sowing cycle.\r\n<p>\r\nThis is her fifth loan with Microfinanzas Prisma. She repaid her previous loans without difficulty and promised to do so also this time. In the meetings with her Communal Bank she patiently explains to her group members any topic which they might not fully understand, and they are grateful for this. Nora will use her loan to buy chemical fertilizers for her next crop of potatoes and peas.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Robert Mouris, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":368890,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy fertilizers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-08-16T11:40:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":525,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nora","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-07-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":1500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":525}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":137.57,"local_amount":393.06,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T15:24:22Z","rounded_local_amount":404.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734228},{"amount":2,"local_amount":5.72,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:10:44Z","rounded_local_amount":5.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118123997},{"amount":385.43,"local_amount":1101.22,"processed_date":"2010-02-11T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:48:54Z","rounded_local_amount":1133.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123959582}],"funded_date":"2009-08-16T15:02:10Z","paid_date":"2010-03-15T10:48:54Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Robert Mouris","image":538858}},{"id":132816,"name":"Irene","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Irene C. is from the village of Poblacion,Clarin,Misamis Occidental.
