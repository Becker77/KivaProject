She lives in Daan Bantayan, Cebu. \r\n\r\nShe has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2008 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. \r\n\r\nBy working hard in her fishing business, Rosita is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 9,000. \r\n\r\nRosita is borrowing PHP 10,000 so that she can purchase fishing gear and equipment.  This will be her fifth loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 10,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. \r\n\r\nRosita aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means \"honorable\"). NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon, a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

They named their group Tene United, named after the home village of the group leader. They are local entrepreneurs in the town of Magburaka, about fifteen miles from Makeni City in northern Sierra Leone. This is the third time they\u2019ve received a Kiva loan through SMT. Previously, each one in the group received a loan of 500,000 LE. That loan created a meaningful impact in the lives of these people. They were able to use the proceeds to pay for their children\u2019s school fees. They\u2019re also able to feed and clothe themselves and their children with the income generated from the loans. Today, they are requesting a loan of 800,000 LE each to buy more goods to add to their businesses.\r\n<P>\r\nFatmata K. (right) is the leader of the group. She is forty-five years of age. She was born in Sanda about thirty miles from Makeni and forty miles from Magburaka. Marriage brought her to Magburaka town, where today she has her business. She is married with six children. Five of her children are in secondary school and one is in primary school. Her husband is a school teacher in one of the schools in Magburaka. Fatmata sells clothes in Magburaka town market. With this new loan, she will expand on her business. She will use this loan to buy a bale of cotton. She travels either to Freetown or neighboring Guinea to buy the clothes she sells. In Freetown, a bale of wax cotton costs her 1,400,000 LE and a piece of dried cotton costs her 14,000 LE.\r\n<P>\r\nSometimes, within a bale of cotton, there are torn pieces. This brings losses to Fatmata and poses a great challenge to her. Apart from this, she faces no major challenges and likes the business she is doing very much. To Fatmata and colleagues in the group, an increase in profit means making their lives better.

This is 32-year-old Mosi M. from Mwanza. She is single with three children, between the ages of three and 15 years old. Mosi M. has been running a used clothes business since 2006. Her business is selling second-hand clothes from America and Europe, which are then washed, ironed and sold in bulk by wholesalers in Tanzania to retailers who then re-wash and re-iron them for sale on the streets and in the surrounding towns and villages. These clothes are becoming increasingly popular, especially among the younger generation because of their low cost and the general appeal of anything modern. She works at the business for eight hours per day, six days per week and is assisted by one employee. Mosi M. currently earns about 300 USD a month from her business. She is requesting a loan of 500 USD in order to buy more used clothes for resale. In the future, she plans to open another business. Mosi thanks you for her support!\r\n\r\n<strong>About the field partner<\/strong>:\r\nSELFINA has taken a leading role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through micro-leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provisioning of a leasing and payback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets; thus, they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":239605,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"To buy more used clothes for resale.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mwanza","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.516667 32.9","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-12-16T05:20:49Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mosi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-15T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-02-14T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:02:41Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20436330},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:55:23Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130602},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-04-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:23:22Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027399},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-05-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:13:01Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613400},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-06-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:01:15Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010480},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-07-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:37:58Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63232779},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-08-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:51:57Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73664595},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-09-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T02:44:48Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87105326},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-10-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T06:24:50Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97022471},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-11-11T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:41:26Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103867721}],"funded_date":"2008-12-16T21:17:47Z","paid_date":"2009-12-15T14:41:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Heather Heistand","image":221619}},{"id":83727,"name":"Ramiro Juan","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Juan is a member of the Tr\u00e9bol (\u201cClover\u201d) Village Bank.

She has been working in breeding cattle for the past 15 years, an activity that she learnt from her parents.  Currently, her cows are very well cared for and fed and for this reason, at the fair of Huancane and Juliaca, where she took her cattle for sale, they were the most sought-after cows by buyers.\r\n<p>\r\nFor Victoria, the hardest thing about her work is taking the cattle to the Sunday fairs, which makes her very tired and worn out.  She has been in this business for 30 years and most enjoys grazing the animals.

The income she earns helps her pay her university tuition, but she says it is very difficult to pay tuition plus books, printouts, and exam fees, since they are quite costly and she also helps pay for her family's household expenses.

Poblacion, Oslob, Cebu. She earns her living by operating three businesses: a restaurant, a meat-vending business, and a fish-vending business. Her husband, Guillermo Z., who is 50 years old, works as an elected municipal official (sangguniang bayan member) to earn his living. They have two children who are 17 and 25 years old. Vilma joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2005 because she aspired after something better for her family. With the help of her past ten loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Vilma has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 29,000 PHP helped her earn a monthly profit of 24,000 PHP, thus uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her eleventh loan cycle, she is borrowing 29,500 PHP, which she intends to use as additional capital for the business so that she can continue to save up for future house renovation and educational plans. Vilma Z. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon--a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a community member who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She plans to use the profit from her business (estimated to be 250 WST or US $104 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\n\nIn 2009, Tuinanau joined SPBD to gain access to financial services. Most of SPBD's clients are unable to borrow from commercial banks because they lack collateral.  This is Tuinanau's 3rd loan with SPBD. \n\n\n\n*SPBD evaluates the living conditions of each of its borrowers.  Generally, a loan manager evaluates a variety of social metrics on a scale out of 3 (the higher the number, the better off the person is) and these are averaged for the \"overall social metric score.\" For example, a 3 out of 3 on \"level of education\" would mean that the borrower has graduated from university.  \n\nAbout SPBD \nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.

uva), ha sido durante mucho tiempo un destino tur\u00edstico para los peruanos adinerados. Pero la verdadera Ca\u00f1ete es una ciudad c\u00e1lida y tranquila con una gran poblaci\u00f3n afro-peruana, los restos de un camino ind\u00edgena, y las influencias del imperio espa\u00f1ol. La ciudad, junto con otros cerca de la costa del Pac\u00edfico, fue da\u00f1ado durante el 2001 y 2007 terremotos Per\u00fa, pero ha soportado como lo ha hecho durante gran parte de su historia..

Mala, with its sandy beaches, pre-Incan ruins, and the production of Per\u00fa's nationally-adored liquor, Pisco (a type of hard liquor made from grapes), has been a tourist destination for wealthy Peruvians for a long time.  But the authentic city of Ca\u00f1ete is warm and peaceful with a large Afro-Peruvian population, the remains of an indigenous pathway, and the influences of the Spanish empire.  The city, along with others along the Pacific coast, was damaged in 2001 and 2007 as a result of earhquakes which occurred in those years, but has continued on as it has always done through its history.  In his free time he enjoys himself; it is well-known that Per\u00fa is recognized for having the most delicious food in the world and one of the dishes that Carlos likes a lot is \"carapulcra con sopa seca\" a traditional Peruvian dish with meat and vegetables.  Carlos studied up to his third year in high school but he would have liked to study to be a mechanic.  Carlos is single and works as a glazier in his shop.  He is so proud of his shop that he works there 12 hours every day.  \n\nIn one day Carlos is able to assist 2 or 3 customers, though it depends on the the requests that are made.  This allows him to earn an average of approximately 100 soles (or about 37 dollars) every day and on a good day he can earn up to 200 soles (about 74 dollars).  This helps Carlos to be able to pay for some additional costs, and he thinks that his business is going well because he is punctual when he delivers the requested work that is asked of him and because of the quality and the attention he pays to customers.  \n\nCarlos is very grateful for the help granted him by those who loan through Kiva, because with this support he will be able to purchase more merchandise for his business.  This improvement will help him to increase his inventory and continue caring for customers and as a result it will allow him in a few months to be able to enlarge his place of business and have more variety of products.  This will generate a higher return for Carlos and will help him to achieve his big dream: to buy a truck.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1125,"image":{"id":963240,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to

Alice works as a schoolteacher for a living. Her community of Lwala Nyamor village does not have access to clean water. The water that is used for drinking and cooking is easily contaminated with bacteria that can cause diarrhea and other water-borne diseases. Alice is a friendly member of the community, and has been elected Promoter by her village to help its members obtain safe drinking water.\n\nAs a volunteer Promoter, Alice represents the community on Kiva\u2019s website and educates the community on how to protect their families from unsafe drinking water by using a chlorine dispenser system. Alice and three other promoters in her community, including WIllis, Michael, and Syrus, need a loan to cover the costs of installing and maintaining chlorine dispensers at the water sources in the area. Alice wants to be a promoter because she believes that the dispenser will help to prevent water-borne diseases so that the community can have good health.\n\nThe Kiva loan will be repaid by Evidence Action (www.evidenceaction.org) on behalf of the community, through the sale of carbon credits. Using the chlorine dispenser generates carbon credits by avoiding the need to boil water to make it safe to drink. Revenues from the sale of carbon credits to organizations and individuals wanting to reduce their carbon footprint will be used to repay Kiva lenders and also to make sure that Alice\u2019s community can have access to safe water now and in the future.\n"}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1799670,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Health","sector":"Health","themes":["Innovative Loans","Water and Sanitation"],"use":"To install and maintain chlorine dispensers to provide access to safe drinking water for the community ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"NDHIWA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":324,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1800,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alice ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Willis ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Michael ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Syrus ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-01-09T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1800,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":72,"loan_amount":1800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2018-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":450},{"due_date":"2019-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":450},{"due_date":"2020-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":600}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2019-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":450},{"due_date":"2020-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":450},{"due_date":"2021-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":600}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":1799,"name":"Marika","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Marika G. \u2013 Blagoevgrad \r\n\r\nMarika G. is 43 years old and keeps a little grocery in Blagoevgrad.

In particular, she sells clothes such as vitambaa (materials), vitenga (African traditional clothes with wax prints), and kanga. She works at her business 8 hours per day and 6 days per week, though she is assisted by one employee. By doing so, Eva is able to earn approximately $80 per month from her business operations. She is now requesting a loan in the amount of $425 in order to buy more materials to make more clothes. In the future, she plans to expand her business. Eva M. thanks you for her support! <p>\r\n\r\nABOUT SELFINA: SELFINA is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback micro-finance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are not considered to be credit-worthy by financial institutions because they lack tangible assets that can serve as collateral. As such, low income women in Tanzania typically receive poor financial support and in turn only limited access to basic needs and services. Fortunately, SELFINA has been a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through micro-leasing to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women in Tanzania. Simply put, SELFINA buys and leases equipment to women through an arrangement called a sale and leaseback transaction. More specifically, when a client needs working capital, SELFINA buys equipment from said client, extends a loan to her to facilitate the transaction, and then leases the equipment back to her. As such, one of the primary advantages of micro-leasing is that it allows clients to use their equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":239643,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"To expand her business by purchasing additional materials","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mwanza","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.516667 32.9","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-12-16T19:30:42Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Eva","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-15T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":85},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":85},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":85,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-02-14T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:02:42Z","rounded_local_amount":105400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20436338},{"amount":85,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:55:16Z","rounded_local_amount":105400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130610},{"amount":85,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-04-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:23:26Z","rounded_local_amount":105400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027407},{"amount":85,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-05-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:13:09Z","rounded_local_amount":105400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613408},{"amount":85,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-06-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:01:11Z","rounded_local_amount":105400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010488}],"funded_date":"2008-12-16T21:01:29Z","paid_date":"2009-07-16T00:01:11Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Craig Kaufman","image":null}},{"id":83743,"name":"Francisca","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Francisca is a member of the Suni (\u201cStrength\u201d in Quechua) Village Bank.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

What she most desires is to get ahead in life.  Although still very young, she realizes that she must work if she wants to provide her family with a good life.  This is why she and her husband decided to open two businesses at once.  From very early in the day she tends to her Internet access booths and in the evenings she sells hamburgers and salchipapas (sausages and fried potatoes).  What she most enjoys about her work is preparing the delicious meals she sells at night.  She has been in this line of work for 2 years and considers the most difficult part of it to be tending to the Internet access booths because she doesn't know much about computers and can't help the customers if they encounter any problems.  For later on, she expects to improve her small eatery to offer her customers improved customer service.  This is Elizabeth's 7th loan with MFP and she is determined to save a little every day so that she can make her repayments on time.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition.

She owns a business venture, 0.  Ake has 3 years of experience in this business.  Ake needs a loan of WST $1500 to buy raw ingredients for cooked foods.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 260 talas or US $108 per week) to financially support immediate members of her family.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Ake joined SPBD.  This is her 3rd loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Ake's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Ake P. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.4 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.3 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.3 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              1.4 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

Ana N. is a married woman who lives in Purok Riverside, Brgy. Su-ay, Himamaylan, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating 3 business ventures: vegetable vending, food vending, and a livestock businesses. Her husband Rey, who is 45 years old, also buys and sells livestock, in addition to helping with his wife's businesses.  \r\n\r\nThey have 2 children who are 4 and 16. Ma. Ana joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2007 because she aspired to something better for her family. With the help of her past 5 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Ma. Ana has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 14,000 Philippine pesos (PHP) helped her earn a monthly profit of 12,000 PHP, raising the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 6th loan, she is borrowing 20,000 PHP, which she intends to use to pay for more stocks of vegetables and an extension of her stall. She plans to continue to save up for the future education of children and a house renovation. Ma. Ana N. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

Cruz, Brgy. Don Virgilio, Medellin, Cebu. She earns her living by operating two business ventures: fishing \/ fish vending and food vending businesses. Her husband Dario L., who is 38 years old, works in furniture to earn his living and also helps in his wife's business activities. They have five children who are seven to 17 years old.\r\n\r\n Lovyne joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2007 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past five loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Lovyne has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 12,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 10,200, thus uplifting the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 6th loan, she is borrowing PHP 12,000 which she intends to use as working capital for her business operations so that she can continue to save up for the future education of her children. Lovyne L. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\n\r\n In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed on a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

In 1983, Nurbubu with her husband started to work at the Karabalta\u2019s carpet factory but their wages didn\u2019t cover household expenses, like rent and supplies. For this reason, Nurbubu decided to start her own business in furniture production. She purchased a garage to use as a furniture workshop and bought equipment. Nurbubu has been engaged in this activity for more than 20 years and has achieved success. With the revenues,  Nurbubu was able to buy an undeveloped house, where she still lives with her family. Last year, she obtained her first loan from Bai Tushum and Partners for purchasing wood and repaid it without any delays. \r\n\r\nNow Nurbubu plans to use the loan of 40,000 Kyrgyz Soms to buy wood, fibreboards and fittings. With the revenues from this investment, Nurbubu plans to open a furniture-making shop near her house.  \r\n\r\nBai-Tushum and Partners uses Kiva funding to target the especially vulnerable population.  Bai-Tushum and Partners is one of the leading Microfinance Institutions in Kyrgyzstan.

Federico joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2007 because he hoped for something better for his family.

This time, for his 9th loan, he is borrowing PHP 25,000, which he intends to use to pay for spare truck parts and to fund his other businesses so that he can continue to save up for the future expansion of his rice and dry goods businesses. Federico B. is a Dungganon man who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of his dreams. \r\n\r\n<p>About NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

Thi Nhan, 53 years old, and her husband, Mr. Vu Thanh Dai, borrowed money to improve their family's economy. They are one of the families in the village with many years of experience in rearing pigs so all the loans were used to invest in the pig-rearing business. Their system is extensive, with large, clean pig sty and proper waste disposal system. Beside feeding the pigs everyday, Mrs. Nhan's family also bathe the pigs and clean the sty frequently. Currently, her family has 100 pigs, 50 of which are waiting to be sold and the other 50 are still small. Mrs. Nhan has 3 children, 1 of whom is still schooling. This time round, she wants to borrow 9 millions VND (550USD) to invest in her pig-rearing business. Her family's average monthly income is 6 millions VND (387USD).\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Vietnamese by Pham Yen Thanh, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\nTham gia v\u00e0o Qu\u1ef9 n\u0103m 2006, ch\u1ecb Nguy\u1ec5n Th\u1ecb Nh\u00e2n 53 tu\u1ed5i c\u00f9ng ch\u1ed3ng anh l\u00e0 V\u0169 Thanh \u0110\u1ea1i vay v\u1ed1n \u0111\u1ec3 ph\u00e1t tri\u1ec3n kinh t\u1ebf.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

She is a widow who is dedicated to selling clothing to \"Pollera\" women (Pollera is a national costume).  Additionally, she is a woman who makes her three daughters, who are at university, study. They have many desires to get ahead and face life and later help their mother who has dedicated her time and love to them. She is a hard-working woman who, since the death of her husband, has sacrificed only for her daughters in order to give them a good education. She has told us that it was very difficult to get over the death of her husband, as much for her as for her children. However, she pushed through to get ahead and now she is emotionally well and her business is going well. With the money from the loan, she will buy merchandise at wholesale. She is very appreciative for Emprender and Kiva for the trust provided in granting her a loan.\r\n\r\n\r\n  \t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Kate Divjak,

She lives with her spouse and her 13-year-old son in the city of Barranquilla, in a location very close to the city's commercial zone, where various stores, businesses and informal traD. all coexist. Betty founded a business preparing food which was aimed at employees of companies in the area, with a diversity of dishes. However, her business was not sustainable in this manner, because her customers were provisional workers, and they left, draining a large part of her capital. Determined to sustain herself in this market, she got the idea to sell food by the portion from 2 points of sale. Thus, she now sells rice with mullet and vegetables (a characteristic local dish in Barranquilla), and chicken and rice, which are served on bijao leaves, accompanied by hard-boiled eggs and a corn-based drink, to her customers in an independent manner. She receives help from her husband and her father in the daily operation of the business. She wants to achieve growth with her business, and for this reason she applied for a Kiva loan, her first financing with the Mario Santo Domingo foundation. She will use the loan funds to buy raw materials and supplies in greater volume, and thanks to this she will receive discounts and be able to increase her production, initiating her process of entrepreneurial growth. She is grateful for the opportunity to strengthen her business, because it will let her increase her family income, so that together with her husband she can help her children get ahead in life. While she works to achieve her dream, Betty manages her business with a 15-day turnover of accounts receivable, a turnover of 1 day for finished products, and a profit margin on sales of no less than 20%, which she plans to increase with her good performance."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":825140,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

He knows his field requires a lot of logic, which is why in his brief moments of spare time he takes the opportunity to play soccer and listen to music.\r\nJordin's greatest dream is to be a professional, competitive graduate.  He is grateful to his parents for the support they offer him in spite of difficulties at home.  And his parents, in turn, are proud of him, especially of the effort he has shown, since they themselves did not have the opportunity to be professionals.  \r\nUpon finishing his studies at the university, Jordin will look for a job that will allow him to pay for his own studies in English, an indispensable requirement in his profession.  At a later date, he will specialize in web telecommunications.\r\nThe loan that Jordin needs will be invested in paying his fourth semester tuition and his boarding."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":846987,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","themes":null,"use":"to pay for tuition and boarding.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Huarochiri","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.916667 -76.416667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":93,"posted_date":"2011-08-22T23:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jordin Joan","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-08-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2011-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2011-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2011-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2012-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2012-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.66},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.66},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":87.96,"local_amount":239.9,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T08:42:52Z","rounded_local_amount":241.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232777628},{"amount":89.66,"local_amount":244.52,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T09:46:10Z","rounded_local_amount":246.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238582136},{"amount":90.89,"local_amount":247.89,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:40:42Z","rounded_local_amount":249.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244540589},{"amount":92.54,"local_amount":252.38,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T09:48:26Z","rounded_local_amount":254.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250751265},{"amount":93.91,"local_amount":256.12,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T09:57:13Z","rounded_local_amount":258.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257158578},{"amount":95.04,"local_amount":259.19,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:07:57Z","rounded_local_amount":261.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263288771}],"funded_date":"2011-08-23T13:10:25Z","paid_date":"2012-03-15T09:07:57Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Marni Siegal","image":829283}},{"id":330457,"name":"Sam","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mr. Sam, age 40, is a humble man and he now resides in Kompong Speu Province.

This field is considered to be more profitable in agricultural locales.  Take a cow, for example.  It gives us meat, milk and possibly a calf.  We make dairy products out of milk at home.  Even cow horns are used for making knife handles by our master craftsmen.  And it comes out very nice.  So Arif has cows and sheep at home and makes a good profit from feeding these domestic animals.  His wife, Mavluda, helps him with feeding livestock and processing milk.  They prepare feed for the cows and sheep every day, give them water and milk the cows.  Arif and Mavluda have 5 children: 2 daughters and 3 sons.  Arif is requesting a loan in the sum of 1200 somoni in order to buy feed for the livestock.         \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Russian by Anna Sorokina-Hailey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":338831,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Purchase of livestock feed","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Gonjy","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":47,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":275,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Arif","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-06-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":1200,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2009-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":600}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":137.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Anna Sorokina","image":null}},{"id":120639,"name":"Virginia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Virginia P. is a native of Cardona, Rizal, Philippines.

Life was not easy to her considering that the source of income for the family was only from her husband\u2019s work as a driver.\r\n\r\nWhen she joined ASHI, she ventured her first loan in the direct selling of ready-to-wear goods from Natasha and MSE products. This business is very popular among Filipino women. Now, on her 2nd loan, she is requesting 10,000 pesos as additional capital for her direct-selling business.\r\n\r\nShe is hopeful that with the proceeds from her business, she can sustain the educational needs of her children and be able to let them graduate from college and find jobs.

She moved to the town of Esteli when she was 3 years old.  She's a single mother with 4 children, all now grown.  Maria has been a merchant for 30 years.  At first, she sold ice, buying plastic bags that she packed with ice and sold on.  Now she sells clothing, cosmetics, shoes, silver jewelry, etc.  Before starting the business, she was a social worker at the hospital in Esteli for 10 years.  In those days, she used to go to Guatemala and bring back perfumes, silver jewelry, etc. that she then sold to her co-workers.  The money that she earned allowed her to better support her children.  Now she goes to Panama where she buys products such as cosmetics, clothing, shoes, purses and jewelry.  She sells on both the wholesale and retail markets.  She also gets t-shirts from a son in Costa Rica.\r\nMaria is applying for a loan so that she can buy other products such as cell phones.  She's never sold cell phones before but she can see that they're an everday product now, something that everyone needs.  She hopes the loan will help her attract new customers and expand her business.  Keeping her business stocked with merchandise will help her create jobs for others, too.  In the future, she wants to build a shop that she can rent out and ultimately could provide her a place to live as she gets older.

Pero hace 10 a\u00f1os que pudo adquirir su propio inmueble y esto es gracias a la labor ardua que realiz\u00f3 en los cultivos de caf\u00e9.

Noralei is 16, and Jair is 10.  They live like a great family in their own house, which is in the Santa Rosa neighborhood in Puente Paucartambo (central Peruvian forest).\r\n\r\nEver since she was young she has worked in agriculture.  Her main crops are coffee and citrus fruits.  However, ten years ago she was able to get her own property.  This was due to the hard work she did with her coffee crops.  Over time she got together the capital she needed to open a business selling groceries, sweets, and drinks.  She has been doing this for only four years.  This was enough time to be able to offer the local residents good service, and, above all, a good price.  This led her to earning more income every day.\r\n\r\nNow Fortunata sells her fruit production in the capital, but she does this without neglecting her business.  She considers coffee sales to be very unstable.  Lately the price of coffee beans has been increasing, and at other times the price has been very low.  That is the reason why she wants to invest in her business of selling groceries.\r\n\r\nShe belongs to the \u201cLuz del Futuro\u201d (Light of the Future) Communal Bank.  This is her ninth loan with MFP, and she is grateful for the partnership so that she is able to carry out her plans.  She pledges once again to make her payments as she did with the previous loans that she has had.

She lives in the Vituka area of Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. Her two sons are in secondary school. Anna is self-employed and owns a shop near her residence. The shop sells different consumable items, mainly food, which have high demand. Anna is an opportunistic type of person, and she cannot let the opportunity go. She opened this shop six years ago after learning that people in her area had to travel a long way to market for food items.

Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets. As they lack tangible collateral assets, they are termed not creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support, hence poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.\r\n\r\nSELFINA buys and leases equipment to women.

She saw the outskirts develop, and has had a restaurant, well known and appreciated by the district, for eight years. The restaurant is called La Esquina del Sabor. She has not always owned her restaurant. Before she opened her restaurant she had a beauty salon, but had to leave because she fell sick. Once she returned to work she began selling food. She chose this type of work because she couldn't leave her seven and eight year old daughters alone. She began selling filled potatoes and tamales to the neighborhood on Sundays.

A college graduate, she runs a small business selling men\u2019s clothing in the central city market in Dushanbe. She believes that one of the biggest advantages of her work is a flexible schedule that gives her the opportunity to take good care of her children.\r\n\r\nMavlyuda has been in business for five years. She has promptly repaid a total of two loans from IMON International. Her attentiveness and creativity have helped her develop a good understanding of what her clients need and want. They always feel complimented when she goes out of her way to help them with their selections. This has naturally boosted Mavlyuda\u2019s sales and led to growth in her business.\r\n\r\nMavlyuda is requesting a loan of $3000 to enable her to significantly expand her business by purchasing a new vending facility. She is hoping to reinvest the generated income into further expansion of her business. She believes that consistent growth will help her provide a stable source of income and continue to secure her family\u2019s well-being.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>More about Tajikistan and IMON International<\/b>\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She owns a business venture, planting & harvesting taro for sale.  Mareta has 2 years of experience in this business.  Mareta needs a loan of WST $1000 to purchase weed-killers such as Gramoxome.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 400 talas or US $167 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nYou can view pictures of a typical plantation in Samoa, taken by a Kiva Fellow, at:   http:\/\/picasaweb.google.com\/agnes.p.chu\/SamoanPlantation\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Mareta joined SPBD.    This is her 1st loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Mareta's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Mareta S. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.3 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.4 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.2 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              1.4 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

She lives in Danao City, Cebu. Martina joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2010 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past two loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Martina has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 7,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 7,600 uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her third loan, she is borrowing PHP 15,000 to use as additional capital for candle-making so that she can continue to save up for future education and expansion of her business. Martina is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.
