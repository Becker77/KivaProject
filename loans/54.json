The group is made up of six members who know one another and are neighbors.  Ms. Emelia invited them to get together and they agreed to request their first loan from Fundacion Realidad.\r\n\r\nThe representative of this group is Ms. Adela B. R..  She is 40 years old and educated through the third year of secondary school.  She has four children (three boys and one girl).  Cesar is 19, Soledad is 14, Francisco is 12, and Alexis is 6 years old.  Adela sells shirts and napkins.  She is requesting this loan to buy shirts and napkins.  She started this business six years ago out of economic necessity and in order to send her children to school.  \r\n\r\nHer uncle makes crocheted tops and napkins from yarn.  She sells the merchandise in her community of Hueyapan by going from house to house offering her goods.  Her daughter helps her to collect payment from customers who owe her money.  The business has helped to feed her family and to pay her children's school expenses.  With her earnings, she buys more tops and napkins.  She would like to improve her kitchen, as she currently has only a provisional kitchen with just a roof.  She hopes to achieve this by selling more shirts and napkins.\r\n\r\nIn her community of Hueyapan, the climate is cool and there are many fruits, such as pears, chokecherries, peaches, and plums.

Poco a poco se dio a conocer y actualmente ya cuenta con varias clientas que la buscan para que les surta los art\u00edculos. <p>\r\n\r\nSin embargo Mar\u00eda comenta que en ocasiones las distribuidoras tienen productos de belleza en remate. Es por eso que Mar\u00eda est\u00e1 solicitando un cr\u00e9dito de US $475 que est\u00e1 dispuesta a pagarlos en un plazo de 6 meses y con este dinero Mar\u00eda podr\u00e1 aprovechar las baratas y surtirse de productos para poder ofrecerle a sus clientas. Con tu ayuda Mar\u00eda podr\u00e1 crecer su negocio para que en su familia no falte nada y en especial no falte dinero en el momento de alguna tragedia."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":108780,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To purchase products for her inventory.

To do better in satisfying her burgeoning customer base, she's now requesting a new loan from Alid\u00e9.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":338369,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Soft Drinks","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To buy plastic bags for packing water ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BJ","country":"Benin","town":"Cotonou Agence principale","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"9.5 2.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":104,"posted_date":"2009-06-19T15:50:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"L\u00e9onie","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-07-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":200000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":16666.67},{"due_date":"2009-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":16666.67},{"due_date":"2009-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":16666.67},{"due_date":"2009-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":16666.67},{"due_date":"2009-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":16666.67},{"due_date":"2010-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":16666.67},{"due_date":"2010-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":16666.67},{"due_date":"2010-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":16666.67},{"due_date":"2010-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":16666.67},{"due_date":"2010-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":16666.67},{"due_date":"2010-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":16666.67},{"due_date":"2010-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":16666.63}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.42},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.42},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.42},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.42},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.42},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.42},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.42},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.42},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.42},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.42},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.42},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.38}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":35.42,"local_amount":16666.67,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T10:24:51Z","rounded_local_amount":16816.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63126460},{"amount":35.42,"local_amount":16666.67,"processed_date":"2009-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T10:51:27Z","rounded_local_amount":16816.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73549886},{"amount":35.42,"local_amount":16666.67,"processed_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T11:13:01Z","rounded_local_amount":16816.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":86983677},{"amount":35.42,"local_amount":16666.67,"processed_date":"2009-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T12:12:22Z","rounded_local_amount":16816.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96896046},{"amount":35.42,"local_amount":16666.67,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T11:08:51Z","rounded_local_amount":16816.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103735626},{"amount":35.42,"local_amount":16666.67,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T11:27:19Z","rounded_local_amount":16816.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110623137},{"amount":35.42,"local_amount":16666.67,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T10:14:22Z","rounded_local_amount":16816.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118019842},{"amount":35.42,"local_amount":16666.67,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T08:21:55Z","rounded_local_amount":16816.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123858336},{"amount":141.64,"local_amount":66666.64,"processed_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T09:40:26Z","rounded_local_amount":67265.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136618494}],"funded_date":"2009-06-20T09:12:25Z","paid_date":"2010-05-15T09:40:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Daniel Kuey","image":669418}},{"id":120401,"name":"Teodora","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Teodora G. is a 45-year-old woman, happily married to Waren, and they are blessed with four children. Three among the four are still studying. One is in fourth year college taking a Bachelor of Arts degree in Political Science in the University of the Philippines; another is in her first year of college; and the youngest is in his second year of high school. \r\n\r\nIt was never easy for Teodora and her husband to sustain the education of their children. They have been through a lot of struggles in life but they did not give up because they have each other to hold on to. Waren is a municipal ambulance driver and Teodora was a plain housewife before she joined ASHI. Coping with financial struggles at that time was so hard for the couple since Teodora's husband was the only one earning. \r\n\r\nFive years ago, Teodora took the opportunity of loaning when ASHI came into her life. She believed that she had the skill to raise pigs and sell them after four months. She knew that she would be successful and that, in this kind of business, she could help her husband earn because this was what most of her family members do as their way of living.\r\n\r\nThrough loaning business capital which she can obtain from ASHI, Teodora will be able to make her dreamed business happen and she will be able to support the needs of her children in school. She is confident to venture in the business pursuit she chose knowing that her husband's support will always be there as well as people around the world through Kiva.

She is 41 years old. Raquel is separated from spouse and has 2 school-aged children. To make a living, Raquel owns & operates a business venture in the retail sector running a general store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling daily use products such as shampoo, soap & toothpaste in the local community.

She has 5 children, between the ages of 27 and 43, none of whom finished their studies in college due to poverty. The income from the business has been insufficient to provide for further education for her children beyond high school. \r\n\r\nLuisa's biggest dream is to raise the family's standard of living. She wants to give her family a refined life. She has been in the fishing business for almost 44 years. The sales seem to be profitable and sound, and she desires to invest more in the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, she joined ASHI (Ahon SA Hirap, Inc.), an MFI and KIVA partner in the Philippines, with the encouragement of having access to more capital for a larger income. She is requesting a loan of Php 20,000.00 as additional capital for her fishing business. \r\n\r\nLuisa is hopeful that her business will grow and that she can earn more income.  She would like to save money to help fulfill their dreams to support her children to have a good life and to send her grandchildren to school to finish college, something she failed to provide for her children. Her children are a big support to Luisa and she also believes that her grandchildren are the hopes of their future dreams.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":436267,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fishing","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"purchase

This has been her way of providing for herself and helping her husband to pay for basic needs such as water and electricity. Her husband works as a sales agent.\r\n\r\nShe raised three children. Two of them are adults and the third is still in her care. In the last few months her sales have lagged, which has meant difficulties in making a profit, and delaying payments.\r\n\r\nAll of this has occurred because of the economic crisis in Nicaragua. Everything is more expensive and a drought has meant that the cost of basic goods has gone up. This, as well as the many people who are unemployed, are the causes of her poor sales.

With this purpose he is requesting a loan of 1000 USD. Sirojitdin is ready to work even harder, make sacrifices and push every once in a while to achieve his goal and become a successful entrepreneur. We believe his perseverance and clear vision will become key success factors in his small business.    \r\n      \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is married to Caparachin, who is 40, and they live with their three children, Bryan, who is 15, Gimena, 7, and Florentino, who is 18 months old. As a large family, they live in a rented house located in the district of Uni\u00f3n. Blanca's farmlands are located twelve kilometers from the city of Tarma (Peru). For 10 years she has planted potatoes, beans, and corn, which she then sells in the central market of Tarma. Very early every morning she goes to her fields, where she cares for and applies fertilizer to her plantings. Here she waits anxiously for the arrival of evening, since when she returns to her house, she opens her little hairdresser's shop, where she not only cuts hair but also sells a variety of articles for the home, which people buy for gifts when they are celebrating a holiday. Blanca's business is very profitable, since she has a good income. For this reason, she is thinking of building her own house in the future and having a larger space to attend to her customers, who anxiously wait for her arrival every night. \r\n\r\nThis is her fourth loan with MFP and she is happy to be able to participate and support, along with her community bank, other people who want to advance themselves like she does. With the loan that she is applying for, she will invest in the purchase of gifts so that she will have a greater variety for her customers. She will also furnish her hairdresser's shop with new equipment."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":610663,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Buy gifts and articles for the home for resale; furnish her hairdresser's shop.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-10-07T04:40:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Blanca ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-09-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":550}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":550,"local_amount":1500,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T09:13:38Z","rounded_local_amount":1538.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221718181}],"funded_date":"2010-10-07T21:16:09Z","paid_date":"2011-08-15T09:13:38Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Pam McMurry","image":null}},{"id":240078,"name":"Anuarite","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Anuarite is 35 years old.

She lives in Toledo City, Cebu. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2002 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her food production and cake making businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 9,000. Susan is borrowing PHP 15,000 to purchase more stock for her business. This will be her 16th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 10,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Susan aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future wellbeing by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

His youngest child is in his last year of school, while his elder son is an adult and helps Homit and his wife with the business.

After having achieved a degree in accounting from an private school, she now works at the city hall of her town as an assistant accountant.  Her parents makes a living by farming and they also owns a grocery store, but they are now going through severe difficulties because the price of fertilizer went up by a lot and they were not able to buy enough.  For this reason, their crops are suffering.  Also, the store that they own is not well stocked since her mother is feeling very worried because of the crops.  Carmen believes that she can help her parents by increasing the amount of products in the store and by making it a profitable business.  She wants her younger siblings to have the same opportunities that she had to get an education.  She is convinced that by increasing the amount of products at the store, they will be able to attract more customers.  Carmen's plans are to continue to work with the hope that her contract at her job will be renewed for another six months so that she can help her parents and her younger siblings.  This is the first loan that she is requesting through MFP.  She hopes to work with this communal bank and she promises to make her loan payments on time.

She lives in Pasay City. Her husband, Nelson, 45, is a house painter. They have three children.\r\n\r\nArlene is a multi-tasking businesswoman. She has a general store in front of her house. She also sells frozen meat products. She also converted a few rooms in her house as apartments for rent. She earns nearly 25,000 PHP a month from these business activities. Her profits are used to support her family\u2019s daily needs. She is also sending her grandchildren to school.\r\n\r\nShe joined the Center for Community Transformation (CCT) Credit Cooperative in 2004.  Having been a member has brought her many blessings.  Through the loans from the cooperative and combined with her savings from her profits, she acquired a residential lot which is now continuously amortizing. Her next project would be to build a house for her family and leave their current house for rent. Arlene applied for a new loan from the Cooperative in the amount of 18,000 PHP.  She will use the funds to renovate her apartment.\r\n\r\nAbout CCT\r\n\r\nThe Center for Community Transformation (CCT) is an organized Christian response against poverty and social injustice.  This is carried out through the fusion of social development initiatives and evangelical mission in a uniquely Filipino context.

It also has a lot of smallholder farmers who work the land and raise animals. \nUnfortunately, the people who do this farm work face many problems, like the high costs of the farm inputs. Rose has full knowledge of this but always finds a way to come through. \n\nRose is from a remote village in the Sirakaru, Kitale area of Kenya and she is elegant and admirable in spirit and effort. She is a role model, a mentor and an inspiration to many young farmers in her village because of her resilience despite personal challenges and her passion to support her family. For the past 10 years, she has been involved in mixed farming, and her primary source of income has been growing maize and vegetables and also keeping dairy cows. Rose has been able to provide nutritious food for her family.\n\nRose is requesting a loan to build a modern dairy unit. A good dairy unit provides a good place where cows can relax and also prevent them from diseases that may arise because of being exposed to harsh weather conditions such as rain.

Her daily business consists of traveling great distances to the countryside where she buys young bulls and cows. These she takes to her corral outside the city where they stay for several months as she fattens them up to eventually be sold to her clients. She began when her best friend, who is also a stockbreeder, invited her to be a business partner. Together, they began with small products such as eggs and wool, and eventually branched out into the profitable business of stockbreeding.\r\n\r\n<p>This 27-year-old, who lights up the room with her friendly conversation and energetic character, has another business in artesan\u00edas.

Mar\u00eda says her goal has always been to save up enough money from both of her businesses and open a small artesan\u00eda shop around the corner from her home.

The two youngest children, on the other hand, still live at home and help them with the business. <p>\r\n\r\nRicardo tells us that previously he used to work at an oil factory that later went bankrupt. Due to this turn of events he decided to find a different way to earn a living and this is how he got started selling charcoal and firewood.<p>\r\n\r\nThanks to his efforts he was able to support his family and help them get ahead. Additionally he was able to enjoy the comforts of owning his house and a truck that he now uses to deliver his products. <p>\r\n\r\nRicardo proudly mentions that he is doing well in his business and that he can count on the constant support of his family.

Their clientele is composed essentially of women and people who are keen on these traditional Malian handicrafts. <P>\r\n\r\nWith their earnings, they expect to make payments on the loan and help support their families. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Teresa Kramer, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1575,"image":{"id":217526,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"buying raw materials (leather, palm fronds, calabashes etc.)","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Koutiala","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2008-11-01T07:00:51Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1575,"lender_count":58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Awa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ma\u00efmouna","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sitan","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rokia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Korotimi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sanata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Haby","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Minata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-11-15T19:38:49Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":800000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":133333.33},{"due_date":"2009-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":133333.33},{"due_date":"2009-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":133333.33},{"due_date":"2009-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":133333.33},{"due_date":"2009-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":133333.33},{"due_date":"2009-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":133333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":262.5},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":262.5},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":262.5},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":262.5},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":262.5},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":262.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":262.5,"local_amount":133333.33,"processed_date":"2008-12-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:29:22Z","rounded_local_amount":134837.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9974046},{"amount":262.5,"local_amount":133333.33,"processed_date":"2009-01-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:28:21Z","rounded_local_amount":134837.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14889419},{"amount":262.5,"local_amount":133333.33,"processed_date":"2009-02-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:13:17Z","rounded_local_amount":134837.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20440212},{"amount":262.5,"local_amount":133333.33,"processed_date":"2009-03-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T22:09:35Z","rounded_local_amount":134837.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27135580},{"amount":262.49,"local_amount":133333.33,"processed_date":"2009-04-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:30:08Z","rounded_local_amount":134837.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36033381},{"amount":262.51,"local_amount":133333.35,"processed_date":"2009-05-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:40:43Z","rounded_local_amount":134837.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44620783}],"funded_date":"2008-11-01T18:38:49Z","paid_date":"2009-06-16T02:40:43Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":75377,"name":"Miriam Danixa","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Miriam tiene 38 a\u00f1os de edad, pertenece al Banco Comunal Luis Alberto S\u00e1nchez II y vive en la calle Sep\u00falveda 300, distrito de Moche, provincia de Trujillo, departamento de La Libertad, Per\u00fa.\nEstudi\u00f3 primaria completa, pero por su situaci\u00f3n econ\u00f3mica no continu\u00f3 estudiando.

She has two children who live at home. Haydee's parents have always been farmers, raising potatoes, peas, and other crops. In the early years of her marriage Haydee continued raising these crops, but she doesn't particularly enjoy farming.\r\n\r\nWhen her daughter was born five years ago, Haydee convinced her husband to open a bodega. He did, agreeing to take charge of the crops while Haydee cares for the children and tends to the store. Since that time, Haydee has spent all of her time and effort on the store, which has grown a client base over the years. This motivates Haydee to continue investing and working on it.

Six years ago he decided to start up his own business because he was about to lose his job. For this reason he bought a photocopier to provide this service to his neighbors. Later he had the opportunity to take his business to a school, so he bough another photocopier and set up a small kiosk offering snacks and refreshments. \u00c1ngel is very pleased with his achievements, but even so he took another job as a security guard, which he does every morning. His wife then tends to the kiosk and copier at the school in the mornings, and \u00c1ngel does it in the afternoons, leaving his eldest child in charge of the copy machine he has at their home. In this way everyone does his or her part to help the family make headway because they know together, with a lot of hard work and dedication, they will achieve their goals. This is the sixth loan for \u00c1ngel with Kiva partner MFP, and during his previous loans he has always shown himself to be very responsible with his payments. With the money he is requesting, he plans to purchase paper and office supplies so he can start selling those items in both his home and at the school, and thus increase his profits.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Marty Greenstein, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":378085,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"Purchase paper and office supplies","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-08-27T04:40:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Angel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-08-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":317.34},{"due_date":"2009-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":332.11},{"due_date":"2009-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":351.15},{"due_date":"2009-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":366.95},{"due_date":"2010-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":380.97},{"due_date":"2010-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":398.7},{"due_date":"2010-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":421.16},{"due_date":"2010-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":431.62}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105.78},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":110.7},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":117.05},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":122.32},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":126.99},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":132.9},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":140.39},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":143.87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":105.78,"local_amount":317.34,"processed_date":"2009-09-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:37:47Z","rounded_local_amount":318.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87081248},{"amount":110.7,"local_amount":332.11,"processed_date":"2009-10-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:10:18Z","rounded_local_amount":333.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96997398},{"amount":117.05,"local_amount":351.15,"processed_date":"2009-11-18T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:55:05Z","rounded_local_amount":352.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103842743},{"amount":455.85,"local_amount":1367.55,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T15:24:25Z","rounded_local_amount":1374.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734324},{"amount":131.56,"local_amount":394.68,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:33:28Z","rounded_local_amount":396.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128992388},{"amount":79.06,"local_amount":237.17,"processed_date":"2010-04-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:37:39Z","rounded_local_amount":238.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136717227}],"funded_date":"2009-08-30T04:12:49Z","paid_date":"2010-05-15T11:37:39Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Marty Greenstein","image":null}},{"id":136866,"name":"Dina","description":{"languages":["fr"],"texts":{"fr":"Z.

He lives with his wife and their four children; two of them are in primary school and the other two in secondary school. For 10 years he has been the owner of a farm where he also lives. There he plants sugar cane and a variety of local staple foods; he also raises cattle. For these activities, he counts on the help of his children and his wife. Once the sugar cane is harvested, he sends it to other cities to be sold, and he also sells it in the local market.\r\n<p>\r\nHis favorite part of his work is giving all of himself and feeling useful to others. Since he relies on steady customers, he obtains very good profits. This is his third loan from MFP. What he likes about working and being part of a community bank is that all his fellow members understand each other and are punctual in their payments. The money that he is asking for now will be wholly invested in increasing the production of his farm.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Pam McMurry, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":447731,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"increase agricultural production","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-12-14T18:20:17Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Narciso","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-11-13T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-12T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":350}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":350,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2010-07-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:36:33Z","rounded_local_amount":1004.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159672729}],"funded_date":"2009-12-14T20:13:27Z","paid_date":"2010-08-15T11:36:33Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Pam McMurry","image":null}},{"id":165773,"name":"Tsevel","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Tsevel L. is 66 years old and lives with her husband and 19-year-old daughter in Zuunmod town in Tuv province, Mongolia.

She is 48 years old. Emily is the group leader of a nine-member group loan offered by ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is Emely B.'s Group.\r\n\r\nEmily is married and has five adult-aged children. To make a living, Emily owns and operates a general store, selling a variety of different products in the local community. Emily has been engaged in her business for over twenty-five years and earns approximately $153 a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2006, Emily joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Emily has successfully repaid a previous loan of 30,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to invest in expanding the business. Emily is requesting a new loan of 40,000 PHP which will be used to purchase new items to expand her product offering. This will be her 10th loan from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated to further improve her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful micro-finance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2125,"image":{"id":500436,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

All of the members of the group are natives of Santa Cruz and the majority live in the Libertad neighborhood of the Puerto Rico district, which is how they chose the group's name. They are responsible people who know each other well and guarantee each other's repayment of the loan.\r\n\r\nEdilia is the president of the group. She is married and has three school-aged children. She sells cosmetics from catalogs and also sells clothing seasonally. Her husband is a salaried driver, but his pay does not cover their household's expenses so Edilia has her two businesses to help meet her family's needs.

","en":"Rosa Aminta Ben\u00edtez, 44, lives with her husband and three children, who are 19, 14 and 12 years of age in the San Francisco neighborhood of Catacamas, Olancho.\r\n\r\nShe started selling groceries ten years ago.  She would buy her stock on credit from a warehouse.  Three years ago, though, she decided to install a grocery store in her home and since she lacked funds at that time she asked FAMA for a loan and with that help was able to do so.

G. is 74 years old and her husband is the same age as her. They had 9 children, of whom 8 are living and 1 has passed away. Despite her age she still sells fruits and vegetables. She has installed a small stand in her home and whatever profits she makes in her  business she reinvests them in the purchase of more merchandise and to provide for some of her  husband's needs. Carmen is a very hardworking person and despite her advanced age and her diabetes she's never without an occupation to earn an income. Carmen has enjoyed being independent of her children by having her own money for whatever emergency comes up. She does not depend at all on her children. They each have their own obligations, family, and dependents to take care of. \r\n\r\nCarmen requested a loan to supplement her working capital, to invest in her small business. She is confident she will be able to repay the loan. This loan was used to purchase: bananas, oranges, mandarin oranges, apples, peaches, pineapples, watermelons, cantaloupes, tomatoes, chilli peppers, onions, garlic, romaine lettuce, potatoes, carrots, chayotes, and zucchini. \r\n\r\nCarmen's wish is to have no further complications in her health. Diabetes is a disease that requires much attention and a somewhat complicated treatment. She hopes not to have a health crisis, but she also wants to prosper with her business. She wants to see steady sales and to never fail to have enthusiasm and wish to work.\r\n\r\nHer hope is kept up when she is able to see her great grand children. Her husband is in good health. She hopes to not have to suffer and to one day pass away without pain. She says that she is not upset about the hour of her passing. \r\n\r\nShe is grateful to all of those around the world who have taken the time to read about her life.  To all those individuals who feel sad or depressed, she wishes them to look up on her life as an example of how beautiful it is to reach her age. Life is a little box full of surprises, but one has to be ready for all those things that are in store for us. Thanks to Kiva and Fundacion Realidad (Kiva Field Partner).

N\u00fa\u00f1ez is married and has 11 children, including two who died, one of which in a transportation acccident and the other shortly after birth.  Emiliano states that losing these two sons emotionally affected him and his wife tremendously, but with the hlpe of their friends and families they were able to survive this tragedy of their lives.\r\n<p>\r\nEmiliana is an entrepreneur, during a number of year he ran a bar\/dining establishment in a space that he rented and that was waited on by his wife and girls. After a time he opened a new business, this time out of his own home, and until this day, it reamins the most important source of their earnings. The business they own is attended to mostly by his wife and it has been six years since they opened this space. At the same time they are dedicated to selling raw materials such as fruits, vegetables, meat, milk products, bread products, canned products and products for the home, among other things.\r\n<p>\r\nThanks to their great aptitude for business and their ability to save, they were able to purchase a truck that they use to sell meats and sausages in the areas outside of the city. The loans that the Paraguay Foundation previously provided them with was a great help in order for them to maintain their business.\r\n<p>\r\nIn the future, Emiliano wishes to expand his business and open a mini market where he can sell a greater variety of merchandise and offer commodity\/choice for his clients. Currently, Emiliano is asking for a loan with which he can acquire larger quantities of merchandise for his store, and his providers will offer him discounted proces for the products he does buy.\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Spanish by Chlo\u00e9 Tuot, a Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nEmiliano N\u00fa\u00f1ez, esta casado, tiene 11 hijos de los cuales dos ya fallecieron uno de ellos en un accidente de tr\u00e1nsito y otro a los pocos meses de nacer. Emiliano cuenta que la p\u00e9rdida de sus hijos le afecto mucho emocionalmente a \u00e9l y su esposa pero que con la ayuda de sus amigos y familiares pudieron sobre llevar el trago amargo que significo esto en sus vidas.<p>\r\nEmiliano es un hombre emprendedor, durante varios a\u00f1os administro un bar-comedor en un local que alquilaba y que era atendido tambi\u00e9n por su esposa e hijas. Luego de un tiempo abri\u00f3 otro negocio pero ya en su casa propia y que hasta hoy d\u00eda es la fuente de ingresos m\u00e1s importante que tienen. El negocio que tienen es una despensa que es atendida principalmente por su esposa y ya van seis a\u00f1os desde que abrieron su local. En la misma se dedican a vender insumos de primera necesidad como frutas, verduras, carne, l\u00e1cteos, panificados, productos enlatados, productos para el hogar, entre otras cosas.<p>\r\nGracias a su buena aptitud para los negocios y su sentido del ahorro, el pudo comprarse una camioneta que lo utiliza para vender carnes y embutidos recorriendo los barrios de la ciudad. Los cr\u00e9ditos que la Fundaci\u00f3n Paraguaya le otorgo anteriormente tambi\u00e9n fueron una gran ayuda para mantener ambos negocios.<p>\r\n En el futuro, Emiliano, desea ampliar su despensa y abrir un mini market, en donde pueda vender mayor variedad de mercader\u00edas y ofrecer comodidad a sus clientes. Hoy d\u00eda Emiliano solicita un cr\u00e9dito con el que podr\u00e1 adquirir mercader\u00edas en grandes cantidades para su despensa, de este modo, sus proveedores le ofrecen muy buenos descuentos por su compra al por mayor.<p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":144396,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Purchase grass, sugar, bread, drinks, milk products, fruits, vegetables, meat, eggs, etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PY","country":"Paraguay","town":"Mariano R.

Her two children do not depend on her anymore and have their own families. She lives by herself in her own home.

She sells women\u2019s apparel exclusively, made by people whom she hires. She likes what she does especially well because of the opportunity to meet many people. Local performance artists come to the shop to try on the clothing she sells and have their pictures taken, which is good publicity for the business.

She enjoys working with the communal bank because people there are very responsible and many have become good friends.

Eldard is a 36-year-old married man with eight children. For the last four years, he has been selling coffee as a means of subsistence. He began the business in Rugaga trading center in Bushenyi district with only 100,000 Ugandan shillings. At length, banking on his hard work ethic, he was able to increase his capital in a short period of time to 2.5 million shillings.\r\n\r\nCurrently Eldard\u2019s business generates him close to 150,000 shillings a month. This is little money by any Ugandan standards but it\u2019s with this paltry monthly earnings that he has struggled to educate all his children.\r\n\r\nBeing a resolutely hardworking and experienced businessman Eldard remains upbeat that he is going to succeed. The one vital resource he has invariably relied on to keep his business afloat has been that friendly chord he has struck with his customers. The high quality coffee he sells is in high favor with many people and coffee outlets.\r\n\r\nEldard\u2019s dream and future plan, as he makes steady progress in his business, is to have his own hybrid coffee plantations so that, from them, he can harvest coffee which he can competitively sell at a higher market price.

Her husband, Cezar A., is 73 years old.  They have eight children who are 32 to 50 years old. \r\n\r\nNicanora joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1989 because she aspired for something better for her family.

Her previous loan of PHP 29,500 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 12,000, thus, uplifting the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 18th loan, she is borrowing PHP 29,500, which she intends to use as additional working capital so that she can continue to save up for the future of her family.  Nicanora A. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income comes from buying and selling dried fish and vegetables in the local community. Clementina has been engaged in her business for over ten years and earns approximately 6,000 PHP a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Clementina joined Kiva partner GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Clementina has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10,000 PHP from GDMPC. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell.  Clementina is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This loan will be the fifth loan taken out by Clementina from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated to improve the general living conditions of the her family. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.

She earns her living by operating two business ventures: farming and selling rice.  Her common-law husband Mario Magbanua, who is 44 years old, works as a farmer to earn his living and helps in his wife's business activities.  She has three children who are 3 to 6 years old. Arlyn joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2008 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past four loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Arlyn has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 10,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 2,500, uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her fifth loan, she is borrowing PHP 13,000, which she intends to use to purchase farming equipment and tools so that she can continue to save up for the future education of her children. Arlyn T. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Its 8 members have shown to date responsibility and the desire for self improvement each in her own business, either dependently or independently.  All, however, coinciD. in giving only the best to their loved ones and to improve daily.  Such is the case of:  Lidia who learned how to work as a micro businesswoman 12 years ago when her husband was laid off from his job.  \r\n\r\nShe figured out how to make knitted wool sweaters and cushions which helped her feed her children who are still minors.  Since income was still insufficient, she decided to also sell beauty products.  The sale of knitted items was good until the El Ni\u00f1o weather phenomenon arrived affecting it and causing losses due to the unexpected weather change (summer).  Not being defeated, however, as she tells us, she had the great idea to make delicious sweets at home like Mazamorra Morada (jelly-like dessert maD. from purple maize), Bundt cakes, chocolate and vanilla cakes.  She also maD. potatoes with eggs, potato and ocopa (potato with peanut sauce) or potato with cream.  She would take her desserts either on trays or in pots to sell them.  She had to walk long blocks to sell in markets, stores, car repair shops, hardware stores.  In time, she acquired more customers thanks to the good service and taste of her home maD. products.\r\n\r\nLidia then became better trained in pastry making and realized she did it quite well.  She now makes cakes for all occasions and social events like fifteen-year birthday parties, weddings, baby showers, school graduation parties, birthdays or any other one she is asked to do.  This has been very good for her.  She never imagined that income from these sales would serve not only to face the difficult economic situation but also to proviD. her children with technical education which was one of her fondest dreams.  She hopes that they will finish their technical studies at a university to be at the same level as their competition in their specialties.\r\n\r\nLidia will use the loan to buy beauty products and cake making supplies on sale because she has several pending orders for school graduation events.\r\n\r\nLidia is second from the right and is wearing a striped blouse.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1950,"image":{"id":651466,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To buy ingredients for tortas and to buy beauty products.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Huarochiri","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.916667 -76.416667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":93,"posted_date":"2010-11-26T01:10:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1950,"lender_count":57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nelly Julia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Petronila","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lidia Soledad","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hilda Esther","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lucia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Norma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Isabel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marlene Edith ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-11-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":5450,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":1950,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":1090},{"due_date":"2011-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":1090},{"due_date":"2011-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":1090},{"due_date":"2011-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1090},{"due_date":"2011-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1090}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":390},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":390},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":390},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":390},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":390}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":390,"local_amount":1090,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T12:52:11Z","rounded_local_amount":1095.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188665387},{"amount":390,"local_amount":1090,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T02:51:42Z","rounded_local_amount":1095.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191408630},{"amount":390,"local_amount":1090,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:35:50Z","rounded_local_amount":1095.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195826922},{"amount":390,"local_amount":1090,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T10:46:58Z","rounded_local_amount":1095.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201269183},{"amount":390,"local_amount":1090,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T10:45:25Z","rounded_local_amount":1095.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206136070}],"funded_date":"2010-12-16T21:43:23Z","paid_date":"2011-05-15T10:45:25Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":256517,"name":"Jesus Divino Amor Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Los socios pertenecen al banco comunal \u201cJESUS DIVINO AMOR\u201d; Este banco se ubicada en el distrito de Cusco, perteneciente a la provincia de Cusco y departamento de Cusco.\n\nLa socia es la Sra.

During the previous harvest season in May, Precy and her family earned about 40,000 PHP which went to pay school fees and buy groceries for daily meals.\r\n\r\nIn the future, Precy would like to earn consistent profits and save for the college education of her two children.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":866649,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy seeds and fertilizer and hire field labor ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Dalaoig, Alcala, Cagayan","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":123,"posted_date":"2011-09-11T17:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":250,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Precy ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-08-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":10000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":250,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T09:12:38Z","rounded_local_amount":10572.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250705316}],"funded_date":"2011-09-11T21:51:25Z","paid_date":"2012-01-15T09:12:38Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":338488,"name":"Carlos Andres","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Carlos tiene 32 a\u00f1os tiene 3 hijos vive con su mam\u00e1 en San Gabriel, se describe como una persona tranquila, luchadora y le gusta siempre salir adelante.\n\nCarlos trabaja en la compra venta de ganado.

Con esta actividad  ha logrado sacar adelante a su familia, conformada por su c\u00f3nyuge y sus 4 hijos en las edades de 18 a 32 a\u00f1os. \nNicol\u00e1s fue educado por su abuela y desde los 13 a\u00f1os est\u00e1 trabajando, primero lo hizo vendiendo cocadas, o dulces elaborados a base de coco y\/o guayaba, luego trabaj\u00f3 ayudando a los vendedores de frutas y posteriormente, cuando conform\u00f3 su familia y con la suficiente experiencia, emprendi\u00f3 su sue\u00f1o de ser independiente. Es por esto que desde hace 5 a\u00f1os, trabaja persistentemente en su propio negocio, teniendo como norte lograr bienestar para su familia, dispuesto a  que en un futuro \u201cno pasen trabajo\u201d, como el mismo lo dice. Como la meta  de Nicol\u00e1s es tener un dep\u00f3sito o local donde conservar las frutas,  gradualmente necesita crecer, aumentando su clientela y su capacidad de comercializaci\u00f3n. Esta es la raz\u00f3n por la cual acude a su credikiva, primer financiamiento que hace a la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, con el cual comprar\u00e1 en mayor volumen y de contado aguacates y limones, para disminuir los precios del producto, pues compra diario con dinero de cr\u00e9dito informal y altamente costoso y con ello para poder sostenerse,  incrementa el precio del producto, raz\u00f3n por la cual est\u00e1 en condiciones desiguales en el mercado; esto es posible solucionarlo con credikiva ,  financiaci\u00f3n que planea seria exitosa porque aprovechar\u00eda  los costos de  oportunidad,  debido a que  tendr\u00eda un capital para negociar  por vol\u00famenes y de contado y lograr\u00eda acceder a precios de productos sostenibles, que as\u00ed mismo trasladar\u00e1 a sus clientes, haciendo que su negocio  sea mas competitivo.\n","en":"Every day, Nicol\u00e1s\u2019s life includes a daily 2-hour walk and he doesn\u2019t do this as a hobby although he does do it joyfully.  Nicol\u00e1s sells delicious, juicy avocadoes that they bring him from El Carmen in Bol\u00edvar Department and lemons farmed along the Magdalena River which he transports in a wheelbarrow lush with the green color of these fruits that he delivers directly into the hands of his customers located in a settlement quite far from the city\u2019s beaches.    Nicol\u00e1s wakes up very early, fills up his wheelbarrow with avocadoes and lemons and heads out to visit his customers.  He has accustomed them to receive their fruit at their doorsteps, a delivery he carries out with a very enjoyable, Caribbean conversation.  With this activity he\u2019s managed to support his family which consists of his spouse and four children ranging in age from 18 to 32.\r\n\r\nNicol\u00e1s was educated by his grandmother and has been working since he was 13 years old.  First he worked selling \u2018cocadas,\u2019 candy made from coconut and\/or guava.  Then he worked helping fruit merchants and still later when he formed his own family and with the gained experience, he started his dream of being independent.  Because of this, for the last five years he has worked persistently in his own business his guiding star being is family\u2019s wellbeing.  As he himself says, he\u2019s determined that they should \u201cnot have to go through struggles\u201d in the future.\r\n\r\nSince Nicolas\u2019s goal is to have a warehouse or depository to keep his fruit, he gradually needs to grow increasing his clientele and his capacity for sales.  This is why he\u2019s calling on a Kiva loan, his first financing with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, that he will use to pay cash for larger amounts of avocadoes and lemons so he can reduce the price he pays since he currently buys daily with money from informal loans which is extremely expensive but this is the way he\u2019s be able to stay in business but the price of his products increases leaving him at a disadvantage in the marketplace.  All of this can be solved with a Kiva loan, financing he hopes will be successful because he will be able to take advantage of special promotional prices because he\u2019ll have capital with which to negotiate cash payments for volume purchases thus obtaining sustainable product prices that he can pass on to his customers making his business more competitive.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":988407,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to pay cash for large amounts of avocadoes and lemons.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2012-01-24T19:00:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":225,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nicol\u00e1s","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-13T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":400000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":62883},{"due_date":"2012-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":64350},{"due_date":"2012-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":65851},{"due_date":"2012-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":67388},{"due_date":"2012-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":68960},{"due_date":"2012-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":70568}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.37},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.2},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.04},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.91},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.79},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.69}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":35.37,"local_amount":62883,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:35:11Z","rounded_local_amount":64517.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263325119},{"amount":36.2,"local_amount":64350,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T09:30:41Z","rounded_local_amount":66023.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270039182},{"amount":37.04,"local_amount":65851,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:42:22Z","rounded_local_amount":67563.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276651314},{"amount":37.91,"local_amount":67388,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T16:05:33Z","rounded_local_amount":69140.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283140921},{"amount":38.79,"local_amount":68960,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:10:38Z","rounded_local_amount":70752.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287100815},{"amount":39.69,"local_amount":70568,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:36:38Z","rounded_local_amount":72402.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294338439}],"funded_date":"2012-01-24T20:44:57Z","paid_date":"2012-08-15T09:36:38Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":781654,"name":"Casse Auto 1 Group","description":{"languages":["fr"],"texts":{"fr":"CASSE AUTO 1 est un groupe de trois personnes, dont les membres r\u00e9sident dans le m\u00eame quartier.

People there have difficult lives.  Since they do not easily get capital funds from the government or the banks, they often have to borrow money with a high rate of interest from loan sharks.  In 2003, TYM Fund opens a branch in this village and starts to lend the villagers money using microfinance.  Mrs. Ha Thi C.\u2019s family has become a member of TYM Fund since then.  At the age of 40, she is confident to borrow at the maximum limit.  She uses the fund on the right purpose and it clearly improves her life.  This time she wants to borrow $400 to buy rush to make sedge mats.  Besides working, Mrs. C. also spends a lot of time taking care of her parents.  She goes to class every other night and makes sedge mats with her parents during the others.  Everyday her family makes 2 mats, each is sold at $3.  \r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Vietnamese by Phuong Nguyen, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nQu\u1ea3ng Kh\u00ea l\u00e0 m\u1ed9t x\u00e3 ngh\u00e8o n\u1eb1m ph\u00eda Nam huy\u1ec7n Qu\u1ea3ng X\u01b0\u01a1ng, Thanh H\u00f3a. \u0110\u1eddi s\u1ed1ng ng\u01b0\u1eddi d\u00e2n n\u01a1i \u0111\u00e2y g\u1eb7p nhi\u1ec1u kh\u00f3 kh\u0103n, c\u00e1c ngu\u1ed3n v\u1ed1n kh\u00f4ng \u0111\u1ebfn \u0111\u01b0\u1ee3c v\u1edbi ng\u01b0\u00f2i ngh\u00e8o h\u1ecd th\u01b0\u1eddng ph\u1ea3i vay n\u1eb7ng l\u00e3i.

Es por eso que Mar\u00eda est\u00e1 solicitando un cr\u00e9dito de US $200 que est\u00e1 dispuesta a pagarlos en un plazo de 6 meses para poder comprar el material que necesita y as\u00ed entregar los disfraces para que pueda recibir mayores ganancias. Con tu ayuda Mar\u00eda podr\u00e1 sacar adelante este trabajo, adem\u00e1s de que con este dinero podr\u00e1 ahorrar un poco para futuros gastos de sus hijos."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":122882,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"Purchase raw material for her products.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"M\u00e9rida, Yucat\u00e1n","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":16,"posted_date":"2008-02-01T18:20:17Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":200,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Candelaria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-02-15T19:28:22Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2008-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2008-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2008-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2008-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2008-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2008-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":33.35}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":34,"local_amount":340,"processed_date":"2008-03-10T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-10T09:32:52Z","rounded_local_amount":369.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":154363},{"amount":34,"local_amount":340,"processed_date":"2008-04-10T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-10T09:32:52Z","rounded_local_amount":369.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":178556},{"amount":34,"local_amount":340,"processed_date":"2008-05-10T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-10T09:32:52Z","rounded_local_amount":369.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206091},{"amount":34,"local_amount":340,"processed_date":"2008-06-10T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-10T09:32:52Z","rounded_local_amount":369.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":233931},{"amount":34,"local_amount":340,"processed_date":"2008-07-10T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-10T09:32:52Z","rounded_local_amount":369.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":262695},{"amount":30,"local_amount":300,"processed_date":"2008-08-10T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-10T09:32:52Z","rounded_local_amount":326.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":291579}],"funded_date":"2008-02-01T19:28:22Z","paid_date":"2008-08-10T09:04:51Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":38522,"name":"Pen","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Pen S., 38, works as a house wife looking after the children and cooking food for her family.

S. Rokia is 29 and a married mother of three children. Like all women of her generation, Mrs. S. decided to earn her living through an income-generating business. She thus decided to sell cloth, which is an item in high demand among women in Mali. In the beginning, she lacked the funds to start her business, like all other women in S\u00e9gou. That was why she decided to join a group that received a loan from Soro Yiriwaso. All of her previous loans have been repaid in full. She purchases her items in Bamako, primarily from wholesalers. Her customers come to buy her cloth and then sew it to wear at important social events (marriages or baptisms). The quality of her products draws more customers than her competitors. With this loan, she would like to purchase 90 units of traditional African \u201cWax\u201d cloth. She uses her profits to help feed her parents (namely her mother), to pay off the interest on her loan, for savings and to help pay her husband\u2019s family\u2019s expenses.\r\n\r\n<p><b>Translated from French by Kristina Jackson, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nMadame S.

This is the case of:\r\nMagali R. I., 39, who is currently the treasurer of the \u201cSan Mart\u00edn de Porres\u201d communal bank.  Although her husband is the main provider, Magali decided to prepare catered meals to help her husband.  She offered her meals to city workers and to UGEL (local school).  Profits from these meals grew and she needed to invest in supplies like a sack of rice, a sack of sugar and utensils.  Thus, she began her participation in EDAPROSPO \u2013 PROSPERIDAD's loan program.  She used the profits from her business for her eldest son's educational expenses (materials and travel costs) since he is studying industrial\/architectural design at a state university.  Magali took some crafts workshops at CEO \u201cSan Juan Bautista\u201d last year and created some items.  She had to stop selling meals because sales declined.  She requests this loan to buy supplies to make Christmas decorations and dolls.  These supplies would include such things as:  decorative ribbons, wreaths, decorations, \"cola de rata\" (rat's tail, a type of colored ribbon) in various colors, silicone, Santa and Mrs. Claus faces, and \"napa\" (stuffing for the dolls).  Her work is very charming as can be seen by the photo and it attracts the attention of friends and family who have placed orders.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":418238,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Supplies to make Christmas dolls.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":93,"posted_date":"2009-11-01T07:01:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1050,"lender_count":38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Magali Rosario","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Enrique Gustavo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Benita Filomena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Zenayda Asunciona","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juana Rosa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juan","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Cesar Augusto","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Carmen Luz ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-10-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":1050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2009-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2010-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2010-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":750}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":262.5},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":262.5},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":262.5},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":262.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":262.5,"local_amount":750,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T12:11:48Z","rounded_local_amount":763.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103780220},{"amount":263.9,"local_amount":754,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T12:46:35Z","rounded_local_amount":767.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110669093},{"amount":263.2,"local_amount":752,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:15:33Z","rounded_local_amount":765.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118064552},{"amount":260.4,"local_amount":744,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T09:46:16Z","rounded_local_amount":757.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123899612}],"funded_date":"2009-11-16T00:32:52Z","paid_date":"2010-03-15T09:46:16Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":153402,"name":"Doris","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La socia DORIS pertenece al banco comunal \u201cSIEMPRE ADELANTE\u201d, es natural de la ciudad del Cusco.\n\nLa socia tiene 31 a\u00f1os de edad, es conviviente, tiene un hijo que estudia en el colegio.\n\nElla alterna sus actividades del hogar con el trabajo de atender su peque\u00f1o negocio de venta frutas al por mayor y menor en el mercado \u201cVirgen Asunta\u201d de la ciudad del Cusco. \n\nLa socia requiere el pr\u00e9stamo para aumentar el capital del negocio de venta de frutas.    \n \nLa socia se encuentra agradecido por la oportunidad brindada mediante este medio y as\u00ed mismo se compromete a cumplir con el pago correspondiente al cronograma.\n","en":"Our client, Doris, is a member of the Siempre Adelante Communal Bank.

community bank in the parish of Jad\u00e1n, where the people make a living in agriculture and raise farm animals such as chickens and pigs. The people are very friendly and have the custom of toasting with traditional maize liquor during festivals where they also maintain their traditional dress with wool garments and sombreros. Mar\u00eda is 38 years old, married and has four children, ages 16, 14, 12 and 9. Her first son works at a body shop, and the money he makes he uses for personal expenses and for his education at a distant school. Her second son helps with household chores, and her two youngest children go to a community school. Her husband works in construction. They live in a small home made of planks. Mar\u00eda has made ropes since she was very young. She learned the craft from her mother and it has now become a way of life. She works in her free time since she has to tend to the household chores and care for her youngest children. She is very content to belong to a community bank with women who are always looking for a better way to make headway for their families. This is her eighth loan, and with the money she plans to purchase primary-need items such as rice, sugar, oil, salt, cleaning and personal products, among other provisions. She will also use it to cover some of the costs of her children's education, and another part to acquire supplies to make her ropes. Her dream is to have a house made of stone.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Marty Greenstein, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":527727,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":null,"use":"Purchase provisions, pay for children's education and buy supplies to make ropes","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Cuenca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2010-04-24T00:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Eugenia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":990,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":82.5},{"due_date":"2010-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":82.5},{"due_date":"2010-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":82.5},{"due_date":"2010-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":82.5},{"due_date":"2010-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":82.5},{"due_date":"2010-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":82.5},{"due_date":"2010-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":82.5},{"due_date":"2010-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":82.5},{"due_date":"2010-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":82.5},{"due_date":"2010-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":82.5},{"due_date":"2010-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":82.5},{"due_date":"2010-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":82.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.34},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.34},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.34},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.34},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":250,"local_amount":247.5,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:17:03Z","rounded_local_amount":250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144709059},{"amount":166.67,"local_amount":165,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:46:53Z","rounded_local_amount":166.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151892358},{"amount":250,"local_amount":247.5,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:10:38Z","rounded_local_amount":250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159632723},{"amount":166.66,"local_amount":165,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:14:55Z","rounded_local_amount":166.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166846763},{"amount":166.67,"local_amount":165,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:07:10Z","rounded_local_amount":166.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172113286}],"funded_date":"2010-05-15T21:16:31Z","paid_date":"2010-10-15T10:07:10Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Marty Greenstein","image":null}},{"id":199166,"name":"Yusuf","description":{"languages":["ru","en"],"texts":{"ru":"\u041c\u0443\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0435\u0432 \u042e\u0441\u0443\u0444 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0436\u0438\u0432\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u0432 \u0433\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0435 \u041a\u0443\u043b\u044f\u0431. \u0412\u043e\u0437\u0440\u0430\u0441\u0442, 41 \u0433\u043e\u0434. \u0416\u0435\u043d\u0430\u0442, \u0438\u043c\u0435\u0435\u0442 4 \u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0439. \u041e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0437\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0441\u0440\u0435\u0434\u043d\u0435 -

In the area where he lives, the people who know him consider him someone they can trust and  someone who is always willing to provide help when needed. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Patricia Linderman, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":577864,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Motorcycle Transport","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"Repairing and maintaining his moto-taxi","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Chep\u00e9n, La Libertad","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":143,"posted_date":"2010-07-31T16:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":725,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Angel Brady","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":135.55},{"due_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","amount":146.79},{"due_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":149},{"due_date":"2010-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":148.71},{"due_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":162.07},{"due_date":"2011-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":158.37},{"due_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","amount":171.63},{"due_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":176.5},{"due_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","amount":179.37},{"due_date":"2011-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":184.73},{"due_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","amount":192.46},{"due_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":194.82}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.14},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.21},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.01},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.91},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.75},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.41},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.21},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.98},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.03},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.96},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.77},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.62}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":102.35,"local_amount":282.34,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:01:43Z","rounded_local_amount":288.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166832924},{"amount":54.01,"local_amount":149,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T09:56:40Z","rounded_local_amount":152.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172099526},{"amount":112.66,"local_amount":310.78,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T13:45:57Z","rounded_local_amount":317.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182530305},{"amount":57.41,"local_amount":158.37,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T12:53:52Z","rounded_local_amount":162.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188667255},{"amount":62.21,"local_amount":171.63,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T02:54:56Z","rounded_local_amount":175.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191409753},{"amount":63.98,"local_amount":176.5,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T08:32:09Z","rounded_local_amount":180.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":196108194},{"amount":65.03,"local_amount":179.37,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T10:49:05Z","rounded_local_amount":183.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201270328},{"amount":207.35,"local_amount":572.01,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:00:54Z","rounded_local_amount":585.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211209589}],"funded_date":"2010-07-31T21:54:18Z","paid_date":"2011-06-15T11:00:54Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Patricia Linderman","image":100107}},{"id":223745,"name":"Tau Meni","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Tau Meni M. is 62 and married with seven children.

However, since her son is already engaged in fishing, the couple decided to perk up their fishing business, so they decided to look for capital and joined ASHI. All her previous loans were utilized in fishing and the profits were used in her hog-fattening business. \r\n\r\nNow they are again applying for a loan to invest in putting up a fish cage\/pond. They will buy raw materials, such as fishing net, bamboo poles and ropes, and pay for the labor and buy fish fingerlings.

C. is a married woman who lives in Sa-ac 1, Buaya, Cordova, Cebu. She earns a living by operating a sari-sari (general) store. Her husband, Jose D. C., who is 47 years old, works as a Trisikad driver. They have 5 children who are aged 5 to 22: 1 already has a family, 1 works to help support the family and 2 children are currently going to school. \r\n\r\nCristina joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2008 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 4 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Cristina has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 8,500 helped to lift the family's standard of living. This time, for her 5th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 14,000. She intends to use this to purchase more stock for her general store so that she can continue to save up for future house repairs. Cristina D. C. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.
