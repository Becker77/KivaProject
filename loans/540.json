O. is 38 years old, married and has one child. His business is located at a garage in Kariobangi, Nairobi and is well known by the name \"Goodwill Trade\". He sells vehicle paints to the mechanics at the garage and to his loyal customers, who are mostly from Kariobangi. He has been running this business for seven years and has two employees. He says that his business is profitable and that his main challenge is financial constraints and, therefore, reduced stock levels. Also, there are other similar businesses in the area so customers are not loyal as they are spoilt\r\n for choice. However, he works very hard to make sure his business continues to do well. \r\n\r\nHe is using his loan of Kes 80,000 to buy more vehicle paints to serve a larger clientele and, thus, increase his profit margin. In the future he wants to be a distributor of paints. He is very hardworking, intelligent and focused.

While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are both collectively responsible for paying back the loan of their fellow group member if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nNena is married and has 4 school-aged children. To make a living, Nena owns & operates a business venture in the agriculture sector, raising crops. The main source of income for the business comes from planting and harvesting rice and corn for sale. Nena has been engaged in her business for over 15 years and earns approximately 15,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Nena joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Nena has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10,000 PHP from GDMPC. Nena is requesting a new loan of 12,000 PHP which will be used to purchase fertilizers such as manure. This will be the fourth loan taken out by Nena from GDMPC.

Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She is 58 years old, widowed and has five adult children. To make a living, Saturnina owns and operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising crops. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from planting and harvesting rice for sale. Saturnina has been engaged in her business for over 35 years and earns approximately 20,000 PHP during the harvest season.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Saturnina joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10,000 PHP from ASKI which was used to purchase additional seeds, seedlings and young crops to raise. Saturnina is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP which will be used to purchase fertilizers such as manure. This will be the eighth loan that Saturnina has taken out from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines.

is full of challenges and that is what makes people stronger and fonder. Like other woman, 38-year-old Jocelyn C. encounters many challenges in life brought about by poverty. Jocelyn is from Malabor, Tibiao, Antique, Philippines. She is married to Rene C., a fish vendor, and they have five children. Their eldest child is already 17 years old while the youngest is 7 years old. All of the children are still studying.\r\n\r\nThis family earns a living by buying and selling fish. They earn a small amount from the business, but sometimes their income is not enough to meet their basic needs because they do not have enough capital. Therefore, Jocelyn decided to join ASHI and borrow capital. She continued their business with capital of 5,000 Philippine pesos (PHP).\r\n\r\nJocelyn is always inspired to improve the business because the children are studying. The support of her husband is always there. For her second loan from ASHI, she applied for 10,000 PHP and this will be used as additional capital for fish vending. Her greatest dream in life is to brighten the future of her children by sending them to school until they get a professional degree. She also wants to build a concrete house someday.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":629929,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish

rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

They have two children, Jair and \u00c1ngel. They care and provide for their children in their own home in the hamlet of Bellavista Huaracayo. Only 9 years ago she started farming. She leases her lands each year and plants with her husband's help. They sow peas and other vegetables. What she most enjoys about her work is being in the field; she says \"I feel peaceful\". She also says that she \"never loses\", because when the price of peas is low in the market, she dries the grain and sells it as a seed. This makes an earning of a little more than the invested money, since each bag of peas hovers around a minimum price of 500 soles. Her main difficulty is not having her own land, and having to pay for her children's studies. So, she plans to save at every opportunity in order to be able to buy more agricultural lands, thus minimizing the costs of leasing. She now plans to venture into sowing potato this season.

He was born and lives in the town of Kapan. He has higher education and graduated from the Pedagogical Institute of Yerevan. In 1988 he got married and now lives with his wife. He has a 22 year old son who is now serving in the army. His daughter is nineteen and she is studying in her junior year at the Yerevan Institute of Linguistics with specialty as a teacher of foreign languages. Yurik's wife works in the military recruitment office in the town of Kapan.\r\n\r\nYurik has been in the distribution business since 2006. He has a contract with a firm which manufactures natural juices, ice cream, cookies, confections, meat products, cutlets and etc. Yurik buys all these products and juices in wholesale, delivers them from Yerevan and then sells them in wholesale to the stores in towns of Kapan, Kadjaran, Agarak and Mergi. Yurik has storage and refrigerators in his house for the business. \r\n\r\nYurik works almost without any days off and already has many regular customers in these towns who for many years prefer to buy in wholesale what Yurik brings from Yerevan and then sell in their own stores. Thanks to the profit from his business Yurik can support his family and pay for his daughter's education. Yurik needs a loan in the amount of 1,000,000 Armenian dram to buy new products for the New Year and Christmas sales.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2650,"image":{"id":911601,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Goods

He is the only breadwinner in his family. A couple of years ago, Nikolai started a small business selling souvenirs and gifts. The business was not able to provide sufficient income to support his family, however, so Nikolai decided to try something different. Today he runs a small real estate consulting agency providing information about real estate market rates, mortgages, lending conditions and trends in the community. Nikolai has been in this business for about one year and makes around $1,000-1,500 in monthly income.\r\n\r\nNikolai is very cheerful and client-friendly. His natural ability to make every customer feel welcome and his willingness to best serve his clients\u2019 needs have ensured the success of his small business. One of Nikolai\u2019s partners is a local construction company. Cooperation with this company helps him stay informed on the latest developments in the real estate market and get many new clients as a result. Nikolai has repaid four loans from \u201cNadiya Ukraine\u201d which have helped to stabilize and grow his business.\r\n\r\nHe would like to get a loan for $600 to print advertising leaflets for his consulting agency and to give him some additional capital for small expenses. This loan will help him promote his services and give him the opportunity to help many more people purchase homes or find good building lots for the construction of their homes. Financial assistance will give Nikolai\u2019s business the economic boost it needs to continue to meet the needs of his customers.

Being a mother to three sons, she lives the humble life of a shepherd\u2019s wife. Twenty years ago, her husband inherited some cattle from his parents and since then, he has been raising cattle and working as a shepherd. <P>\r\n\r\nAtyrkul, being a housewife, takes care of the household. She also actively helps her husband look after their cattle. Her daily routine begins with milking cows in the morning, then selling the milk to her neighbors. Besides cows, they keep some other livestock, too. So, Atyrkul has always a lot to do around the house. <P>\r\n\r\nHaving lived all her life in a rural area, she decided to send her eldest son to college, to live in the city. Two other sons live at home and help their parents. By selling some of their livestock, they managed to buy a house, though Atyrkul\u2019s monthly income from selling milk is just US$ 65. <P>\r\n\r\nNow, Atyrkul is desperate to buy another cow. One more cow means more milk for sale, consequently more daily income to save for their second son\u2019s education. For villagers every liter of milk is valuable, since it brings cash, which is a rare thing in a village area.<P>\r\n\r\nHere are Atyrkul\u2019s partners: Amanbu, Altyn and Nazira. Amanbu is fifty. With her husband she keeps livestock: one cow and twenty sheep. Her husband is an electrician, but Amanbu, being a housewife, meets her daily needs by selling milk. Now, Amanbu wants to get a loan to buy a calf and with the rest of the loan she would purchase sheep for fattening and resale. <P>\r\n\r\nAltyn is twenty-five. She is married and has three children. To help her husband, who is a welder, she sells foodstuffs and earns US$ 130. She needs a loan to include more vegetables, fruit, and salads in her assortment. <P>\r\n \r\nNazira is twenty-three. She is not married yet. However, for five years already she has lived independently in terms of finances, as she has been selling newspapers, magazines and some detergents. Nazira needs a loan to open a small shop to sell detergents out of. <P>\r\n\r\n======================================\r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---<P>\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance, a young and ambitious socially-focused MFI in Kyrgyzstan.<P>\r\n\r\nMol Bulak Finance is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development on the basis of 3-Ps concept - People (building human capital and taking care of its customers and the society as well), Profit (to be profitable to grow further) and the Planet (taking care of the environment).

He started working as an apprentice in another workshop and he grew to like the trade, so he managed to buy his own sewing machine and gradually acquire other necessary tools.  He decided to establish his business from his home, but he did not have enough customers.  But this did not get him down, because having his own business helped him to get ahead and with the support of these loans he will achieve success.  Currently he requests financing for working capital so that he can buy fabric, scissors, thread, embroidery and buttons because we are approaching the school season.  His wish is to expand his premises a little more and offer employment.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Lisa Grobar, Kiva

Everyday Edita wakes up very early to care for her children and to get them ready for school. Next, she begins the long trek to sell beauty products which she has been selling for the past three years. Although she is tired from doing housework and then going to work, she appreciates it a lot because she can earn her own money and this makes her feel accomplished because she doesn't have to depend so much on her husband.\r\n<p>\r\nIn addition, she believes that her power of persuasion to recommend what type of makeup fits each person is what allows her to sell her merchandise not only to clients that she knows, but also to strangers, who can rely on her good taste. She is also an enterprising woman who has plans in the future to move her store to her home where she can sell her products in greater comfort and open up a clothing store, as well.\r\n<p>\r\nThis is Edita's first loan with MFP (Kiva Field Partner) and she promises to make all of her payments because she does not want to make a bad impression with the other members of the group. She plans to invest the money she is requesting in buying a greater quantity of merchandise, especially her special order products, so that she can have them in stock and sell them for higher prices later on.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Erin Sindewald, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":483376,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"increase stock of special order merchandise ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-02-05T17:40:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":200,"lender_count":4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Edita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-01-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2010-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2010-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2010-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2010-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2010-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":85}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.2},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.2},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.2},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.2},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.2},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":33.2,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:49:27Z","rounded_local_amount":94.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123960331},{"amount":33.2,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:33:30Z","rounded_local_amount":94.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128993178},{"amount":33.2,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:38:27Z","rounded_local_amount":94.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136717963},{"amount":33.2,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:39:54Z","rounded_local_amount":94.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144751639},{"amount":33.2,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:03:00Z","rounded_local_amount":94.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151934106},{"amount":34,"local_amount":85,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:37:01Z","rounded_local_amount":96.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159672880}],"funded_date":"2010-02-06T16:20:15Z","paid_date":"2010-08-15T11:37:01Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Erin Sindewald","image":null}},{"id":178199,"name":"Faasaveve","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Faasaveve T. is 58 and married with 4 children (ages 12 - 29).

Faasaveve needs a loan of WST $1750 to purchase additional seeds, seedlings & young crops to raise.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 500 talas or US $208 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nYou can view pictures of a typical plantation in Samoa, taken by a Kiva Fellow, at: http:\/\/picasaweb.google.com\/agnes.p.chu\/SamoanPlantation\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Faasaveve joined SPBD.    This is her 4th loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Faasaveve's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Faasaveve T. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                         1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:            1.5 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:                1.6 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

The first loan of 12,000 meticais was used to buy agricultural supplies for his machamba (a large garden or small field).  These 15,000 meticais will be used to increase his inventory and meet the needs of the pilgrims.  He is confident that he will pay off the loan ahead of schedule and ask for another to begin building a chicken coop.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Danielle Maxson, Kiva

R. is 29 years old, married and supports her family by operating three business ventures: furniture making, food vending and a piggery. She lives in Prk. 2, Brgy. Tumarbong, Roxas, Palawan. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2007 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her furniture making, food vending and piggery businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 8,200. \r\n\r\nMichelle is now borrowing PHP 20,000 so that she can purchase new equipment. This will be her sixth loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 14,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Michelle aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future wellbeing by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means 'Honorable'). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed on a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

With the loan from Kiva, she would like to pay workers who harvested maize. The profits from the business will be used to improve her welfare and pay school fees of her children.\n\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions. Urwego Opportunity Bank is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Rwandan farmers.

The majority of the members work in the cultivation and sale of garden plants, some sell groceries, and a few sell clothes for men, women, and children.  A special characteristic of the group is their unity, which is demonstrated as they coordinate the sale of their products each weekend in the main neighborhood square. <p>\r\n\r\nThe group is currently in the 7th cycle of the Entrepreneurial Women program, where each member manages an average credit of ~$188.  The members are involved in the sale of plants, clothing, and groceries. <p>\r\n\r\nThe women of the committee found out about the program through the local newspaper, and got in contact with the Caacupe office program advisor.  The group of 15 women formed quickly, calling itself the \u201cTekova Pora Rekavo\u201d committee, and the first meetings were carried out in group president Marta S.\u2019s home.  They are very grateful to Fundacion Paraguaya for the support they are receiving through the program, and that not only are they receiving credit, but also training that helps them learn how to confront the challenges that come with being small businesswomen. <p>\r\n\r\nThe loan they receive will be invested in the purchase of fertilizer, flowerpots, seeds, and garden plants; other women will invest it in the purchase of basic products like sugar, herbs, milk, and beef among others. <p>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Spanish by Scott Crandall, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nEl comit\u00e9 est\u00e1 compuesto por 15 se\u00f1oras trabajadoras de la compa\u00f1\u00eda Kennedy de Caacup\u00e9, la mayor\u00eda de las integrantes se dedican al cultivo y venta de plantas para jard\u00edn, algunas poseen despensas y una minor\u00eda se dedica a la venta de ropas para damas, caballeros y ni\u00f1os, una de las  caracter\u00edsticas muy especial del grupo es que son muy unidas, inclusive cuando deben coordinar la  exposici\u00f3n de sus productos los fines de semana en la plaza del barrio. <p>\r\n\r\nActualmente el grupo se encuentra en el 7mo. ciclo del programa de comit\u00e9 de Mujeres Emprendedoras, y la misma est\u00e1n siendo beneficiadas con un cr\u00e9dito promedio de gs. 853.000 cada integrante.

Odildjon is 33 years old. He is married and has two children. Odildjon is a very diligent and hardworking man. With his car, he is providing taxi services. For the last 3 years, this business has been the main income for the family, allowing Odildjon to improve the living conditions of his large family. Along with his wife and children, he is also supporting his mother and brother. As any business generating income, the business of Odildjon also requires some investments from time to time. Thus, his car needs some fixing. For this purpose, Odildjon requests 1,500 USD for purchasing spare parts. Odildjon promises to repay the loan promptly and thanks all supporting him.  \r\n<p>\r\n<b>Tajikistan:<\/b><br>\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history and diverse culture, which is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet influence, New West culture, and Central Asian traditions. It served as a key post along the Silk Road and marked the end of Alexander the Great's extensive rule. It was the birthplace of the great Persian poet Rudaki and famous Islamic philosopher Ibn Sina. And it is home to epic mountain passes, communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>IMON International:<\/b><br>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition.

Also, she wants to take advantage of the Christmas season because that is when she sells the most.\r\n\r\nThis has made her decide to request this loan from Integral.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She  supports her family by operating 2 business ventures:  used clothing and ready-to-wear (RTW) businesses. She lives in Brgy. Tugas, Tanjay City, Negros Oriental. \r\n\r\nRedela has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2006 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her used clothing and RTW businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of 6400 PHP. \r\n\r\nRedela is now borrowing 19,000 PHP so that she can purchase more stock to sell. This will be her 7th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of 18,000 PHP, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Redela aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon--a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

There he has a business where he sells drinks, soft drink and has games available, like billiards and domino. And this is where the name of the business comes from: \"Billares Domino\". Domingo started this activity because he had had previous administration experience, for several years in his birthplace. He says that it was through this business that \"doors opened\". He took advantage of the opportunities in the market, becoming independent and reaching many of his expansion goals. He is investing his Kiva loan, the first loan that he accesses through Fundacion Mario Santo Domingo (Kiva Field Partner), on the purchase of fruit juices, soft drinks by the box, and drinks. His goal is to supply himself and to sell in retail and to businesses who have sold out of the products. His greatest challenge is a limited capital to use for expansion, as well as the competition.

A., a native of Catembe, grew up with his mother and attended school until the eighth grade. Due to increasing pressures he discontinued his studies and has since sought a profession that can help him in the support of his family, especially after his parents\u2019 separation. In 1992, he began an apprenticeship as a mechanic. During these 3 years he also worked in the offices of Radio Mozambique. At the end of these 3 years, he began to work for himself, opening a small vehicle repair shop. In early 2006, he acquired a Land Rover from a friend and began to transport passengers from Catembe to Ponta de Ouro, 120 km from the city of Maputo. Right now, the Land Rover is disabled. With the loan Cristelo intends to repair his vehicle. His services are a positive contribution to the community. The route he operates lacks sufficient transport due to precarious road conditions. Only 4-wheel-drive vehicles like Cristelo\u2019s are capable of traversing these roads. Cristelo also has to account for an increase in rent and securing another job. A family of five, including himself, his wife and three children, are dependent on this business. In the future, he intends to improve his transportation services by obtaining a vehicle with greater passenger accommodation. <p> <b>Translated from Portuguese by Marco Alves, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>Cristelo A., jovem natural da catembe, cresceu com a m\u00e3e, frequentou a escola at\u00e9 a 8\u00aa classe, dada press\u00e3o da vida desistiu de estudar procurando desde ent\u00e3o uma profiss\u00e3o a qual podia ajudar no sustento familiar uma vez que os pais estava separados.\r\n\r\n Em 1992, iniciou com aprendizagem da mec\u00e2nica e tendo trabalhado durante 3 anos na oficina da R\u00e1dio Mo\u00e7ambique.\r\n\r\nPassado os tr\u00eas anos come\u00e7ou a trabalhar por conta pr\u00f3pria onde abriu uma pequena oficina de repara\u00e7\u00e3o de veiculos.

He is married and a father with four children. He lives at Takroase, a mining community at Akim Oda, in the eastern region of Ghana. Sulemana is very resourceful and committed to his family, especially in the area of their education. He is a buyer and seller of gold and diamonds. He makes a living with this business and has worked in the field of mining for fifteen years. He has many suppliers in the village from whom he purchases the gold and the diamonds. Through the relationship he has with the suppliers, he always has stock to sell. He mostly deals with foreigners who come from abroad to buy his gold and diamonds. \r\n<p>\r\nGhana is rich in natural resources. It is a fact that the quality of diamonds and gold from Ghana is rated as one of the best as compared to other countries. This has created increased demand from his buyers, but he is not able to meet those demands. He buys the gold and diamonds at high prices from the suppliers, but, because of the economic situation he now finds himself in, he is not able to buy more.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He lives on the plateau of Diakhaye, a neighboring town to the village of Baye Laye Guediawaye. In May 2009 he joined the U-IMCEC savings bank in Baye Laye. Mr. D. has been carrying out his cabinet-making business since 1969. He puts his creations on display and works to order. It is a profession he has chosen out of love and one out of so many that he could have chosen. From a profitability point of view, his business is particularly interesting during the run up to festivals, because there are a lot of orders during this period. However, during the winter period wood is rare. Consequently he is applying for a loan of 500,000 francs which will be used to buy wood in order to make beds and other furniture that he will sell. The loan will allow him to increase both his work capacity and his profits. As such, he will be able to provide better for his needs and those of his family. He is married and has eight children, the ages of whom range from three to 30 years.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Alison Le Bras, Kiva

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She lives with her two children and her husband in an area of Alajuela that has been supported by institutions such as the 'Instituto Mixto de Ayuda Social' with the goal of improving residents' quality of life.  Seven years ago, under her own initiative, Mar\u00eda set up her business selling clothes and other articles.  Over the years and thanks to her own hard work, she has grown in her business, meeting other needs of her customers, buying electrical appliances from Golfito free port.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda's main priority is to support her children in their studies.  At the same time, Mar\u00eda herself is taking some distance-learning courses so that she can finish her high school education.  She has just passed her seventh year.  This has helped her to improve her business and she hopes, in the short term, that she will be able to obtain her high school diploma.  This is Mar\u00eda's first loan.  A friend recommended that she approach Fundaci\u00f3n Mujer when she heard about the institution on a radio program.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda started her business with a loan of 25,000 colones that she received from her aunt.  With this money she bought underwear and set up her business.  Her capital has gone around and she has diversified the range of products that she offers to her customers.  She currently makes catalog sales and travels to Golfito to buy electrical appliances which she sells on credit.\r\n\r\nWe have performed a credit report on the client and verified the different business activities that she carries out.  She shows the ability to make her repayments on time.  She is also planning to use her loan money to travel to Panama where she will buy merchandise (mainly clothes) at a very good price, thereby strengthening her working capital for other activities.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda has small premises in her home where she keeps a small inventory of products.  She works there in the mornings after having got her children ready for school.  In the afternoons, she displays her products in nearby towns which has helped her to increase her customer base.  She provides her customers with credit facilities.  Mar\u00eda's activities support her household financially, together with the money her husband makes from his work.

about Tajikistan and IMON International\n\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

In their loan application, the group described their business as follows:<p>\r\n\r\n\u201cBackground:  The Casamance is a very remote region of Senegal.  It has the potential to be rich, but is nevertheless very poor.  Its population is young and the majority are women, who dominate the local economy and constitute the engine of development.  In this area, the majority of young girls and women do not have any source of income, and this is the cause of the exponential growth in migration away from rural areas.<p>\r\n\r\nThe women of Casamance are brave and hardworking, especially in trade.  However they lack the chance to put these attributes to good use, because they are trapped in a vicious cycle of poverty and deprivation.  In fact, in many cases the wife is the most important member of the household, thanks to her role in producing food for the family and countless other responsibilities...<p>\r\n\r\nPurpose:  The objectives of this trading business include restarting local economic activities, motivating young women to stay in their home villages by creating revenue-generating activities, creating revenues for women at the household level, fighting poverty by increasing income, guaranteeing the grassroots development of the locality, fighting malnutrition among mothers and children, and providing good-quality products to the inhabitants of the village.<p>\r\n\r\nBusiness activities:  This business consists of lending money to the women of the village group so that they can engage in trade of products such as fresh, dried and smoked fish, sugar, tea, palm oil, vegetables, rice, oil, etc.  At the same time, the women will purchase millet, cashew nuts, and other specialties of their own village to resell in the large town markets.  This will allow the women to make a profit and repay the loan.\u201d <p>\r\n\r\nOriginal French business description:<p>\r\n\r\n\u00abContexte : La Casamance est une r\u00e9gion tr\u00e8s enclav\u00e9e du S\u00e9n\u00e9gal.

A partir de cette activit\u00e9, les femmes vont fructifier l\u2019argent pour arriver au bout de la dette. \u00bb<p>\r\n\r\nBackground<p>\r\n\r\nSenegal is one of the world\u2019s poorest countries, yet its solid democratic tradition and highly developed associational life distinguish it from other countries in its income group. Especially remarkable are Senegal\u2019s networks of rotating savings and credit associations, known as tontines. Commonly organized by groups of twenty to thirty housewives who live in the same village, the tontines provide poor women throughout the country with small loans to finance modest income-generating activities. Repayment rates within these associations are excellent, because they are based on local reputation and personal trust between the members. However, their financial resources are limited to the contributions of their members, frequently subsistence farmers with very little disposable income. This has prevented the traditional tontines from meeting the demand for rural microenterprise loans and restricted their impact on the economic development of their communities. The SEM Fund works to bridge this gap by linking traditional village credit associations with outside sources of finance.

This leads to poor financial support and poor coverage of basic needs and services for women with low incomes.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

After the break-up of her marriage, she fell into depression, but thanks to the support of her parents, she was able to set up a business in a space that they gave her inside their house. Since then, she has felt like a very useful woman for her children, and she is happy with her store, which is open from 6 in the morning until 11 at night. This turns out to be very profitable for her on weekends, selling beer and soda, for which she earns 10.0 soles per box. This income helps her cover food and education expenses for her children. For now, she would like to stock up her store with cases of beer, thereby assuring the well-being of her children until they are grown up. This is her seventh loan with MFP, and she is committed once again to continue working as she has up to this point within her communal group, since she is a very responsible person. With this money, she is going to purchase soda and more cases of beer, in order to generate more income.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Mark Broscoe, Kiva

Gulmurod is 55 years old. He is married and has three children. Gulmurod is the sole breadwinner for his family and his only income comes from the raising large livestock and their sale at the local market. Every year, he buys young heifers from farms in adjacent villages. He raises the heifers with the help of his wife and young son. He then sells the adult cows and bulls to local butchers. Today, Gulmurod is thinking about expanding his business, since the income from his present herd isn't enough to provide for his family. He plans to purchase additional young cattle. To do this, he needs to invest an additional $1200 USD in his business. In order to receive this amount, Gulmurod has applied for a loan from Kiva's partner organization, IMON International.    \r\n \r\n \r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Pedro has a stand located in the main streets of Lota, where he sells delightful sweets and children's crossword puzzle and word search books. Pedro's business sits in a commercial district area and is quite far from his home. Pedro's stand has no roof, so Pedro uses an umbrella to protect it from the sun and cover for the rain. Pedro has worked this stand for the past 15 years, but has worked in this type of business for the past 25 years.\r\n\r\nPedro started selling items in the street fairs and little by little he started working towards establishing the stand he holds today from Monday to Saturday. For many years, Pedro\u2019s wife has also run a stand, but of fruits and vegetables, in the street market.\r\n\r\nWith this loan Pedro will purchase merchandise, a new and larger umbrella and will send his stand-booth to get repaired. Pedro is a father of three; the two oldest sons are professionals and no longer reside with him. Pedro\u2019s youngest son just graduated from high school and is 18 years old; he still resides with Pedro and is looking for work to continue his studies. Pedro\u2019s goal is to support his son through his studies as he did with his older sons, thanks to his business and wife. \r\n\r\nThe entrepreneurial training offered by Kiva Partner Fondo Esperanza has been very helpful to Pedro, as he has improved his money management skills. Pedro is also grateful for his loan officer and the companionship of his other fellow group members. \r\n\r\nIn Mapudungun (the language of the indigenous Mapuche population), Lota means \"Humble Village\".  It is a coastal community located near to the city of Concepci\u00f3n in the southern region of B\u00edob\u00edo. Lote is known for its large coal deposits, which were very important in the history and development of Chile. Chilean writer Baldomero Lillo memorializes Lota and the difficult living conditions of its coal miners in his book Subterra (Underground).\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":875,"image":{"id":609945,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To buy merchandise and items to fix Kiosk Stand.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CL","country":"Chile","town":"Lota","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-30 -71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":157,"posted_date":"2010-09-30T20:20:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":875,"lender_count":29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Pedro","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-09-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"CLP","disbursal_amount":413197,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":875,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":24588},{"due_date":"2010-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":24748},{"due_date":"2010-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":24909},{"due_date":"2010-10-27T07:00:00Z","amount":25071},{"due_date":"2010-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":25235},{"due_date":"2010-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":25399},{"due_date":"2010-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":25564},{"due_date":"2010-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":25731},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25898},{"due_date":"2010-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":25894},{"due_date":"2010-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":26384},{"due_date":"2010-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":26407},{"due_date":"2010-12-29T08:00:00Z","amount":26579},{"due_date":"2011-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":26752},{"due_date":"2011-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":26926},{"due_date":"2011-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":27112}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.07},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.41},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.74},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.09},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.44},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.79},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.13},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.49},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.85},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.83},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.87},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.92},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.29},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.65},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.02},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.41}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":210.31,"local_amount":99316,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T13:51:20Z","rounded_local_amount":102181.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177404235},{"amount":215.85,"local_amount":101929,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T14:00:41Z","rounded_local_amount":104869.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182542667},{"amount":277.76,"local_amount":131162,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T13:04:53Z","rounded_local_amount":134946.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188679403},{"amount":171.08,"local_amount":80790,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T03:22:16Z","rounded_local_amount":83120.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191420837}],"funded_date":"2010-10-01T07:34:52Z","paid_date":"2011-02-16T03:22:16Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Brett & Margaret Silberg","image":null}},{"id":240024,"name":"Janet","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Janet is a 38-year-old married lady with three children who are in school.
