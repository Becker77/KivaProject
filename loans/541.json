She's married and a mother of two boys, ages 5 and 3. She lives on Tacna Avenue in the town of Mazocruz. In 2002, she decided to join the Generation 2000 Community Bank, and with her initial loan she purchased outfits for infants, jackets, and wool pants. Teresa was orphaned at age 12, and the next year she started selling gelatins. When she turned 21, she started a family and began selling clothes, making sweaters and cloths for TVs.

The organization is devoted to the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through microfinance as a practical way to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women.

family in the village of Kokzhar in the south of Kyrgystan. 15 years ago he launched his cattle raising business with a starting capital of 10,000 KGS. Tireless work and dedication   allowed him to grow his business, which now brings him a monthly income of 20,000 KGS.

However, luck was on her side, and in the year 2005, Anne teamed up with her cousin Fridah Wanjiku and together, they rented a stall and they agreed to share the rent.  Anne deals in the sale of shoes and an assortment of other items, while her cousin deals in the sale of clothes, hence their businesses are complementary.  During the holiday seasons like the upcoming month of December, the demand of clothes and shoes are always high because this is when many people buy things as gifts for their families, both in urban and rural places.\r\n\r\nAnne\u2019s business has been growing due to the high population in her area, and she finds that she always runs out of stock due to the high demand of the items in her stall.  She now needs to purchase stock of men\u2019s shoes, ladies\u2019 shoes, children\u2019s shoes, plastic items, cutlery, and also bedcovers. Wamaitha is therefore requesting a loan of USD 775, with which to increase her inventory.  With an increase in her stock, she will be able to increase her profit, hence resulting in more income.  She also intends to employ an additional person to help her around the boutique. The repayment period for her loan will be 10 months."}},"status":"deleted","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":78505,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Shoe Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To purchase stock of assorted shoes, assorted plastic items, cutlery and bedcovers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Mlolongo settlement","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":36,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":750,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Anne","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":null,"disbursal_currency":null,"disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":null,"repayment_term":null,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[],"scheduled_payments":[],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":26536,"name":"Mshikamano Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"(Left to Right) Sulemani C., Hassani B.

We are four women who all live in the city of Tegucigalpa.  I'm Johanna B., I'm 23 years old and I'm the coordinator of the group.   Glenda Xiomara is 34 years old, Zonia C. is 29 and Nancy M. is 27 years old.   We are all young and work making and selling tortillas.  Glenda sells clothing as well.  Very early in the morning, we make the first batch of tortillas which we pack and sell.  In the middle of the day, we make another batch to sell from 4 in the afternoon onwards.   The demand for the tortillas has grown a lot and we can hardly cope with all of the requests.  We need the loan so that we can make greater quantities and increase our sales and our income.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":255842,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty Salon","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"To purchase additional hair products for her salon.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Dar es Salaam","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-6.8 39.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-01-16T05:00:11Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":225,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elinaike","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":300000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-02-25T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:03:58Z","rounded_local_amount":50437.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20436383},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-03-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:56:09Z","rounded_local_amount":50437.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130655},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-04-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:24:47Z","rounded_local_amount":50437.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027452},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-05-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:14:37Z","rounded_local_amount":50437.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613453},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-06-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:02:21Z","rounded_local_amount":50437.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010533},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-07-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:38:38Z","rounded_local_amount":50437.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63232829}],"funded_date":"2009-01-16T11:00:55Z","paid_date":"2009-08-15T18:38:38Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Heather Heistand","image":221619}},{"id":87999,"name":"Cecilia Del Carmen","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Cecilia del Carmen M. tiene 39 a\u00f1os de edad, es acompa\u00f1ada y junto a sus tres hijos menores de edad reside en el municipio de Apopa, departamento de San salvador.

All the preceding loans have been correctly repaid.  \r\n<p>\r\nThese women intend to use this loan to buy 180 kg of onions, 200 kg of salt, 10 boxes (2 kg each) of tomato paste, and a large quantity of various condiments.  Supplies are gotten at the Fana marketplace in order to be sold retail at the local ZAFINA marketplace, cash or credit accepted, to customers composed essentially of women.  \r\n<p>\r\nWith this loan, the group members hope to make a profit of 25,000 francs CFA that they will use to buy some small ruminants.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":279330,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Market","sector":"Food","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"To buy condiment ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Fana ","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2009-04-01T07:00:18Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":700,"lender_count":27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mama Issouf","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kadia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kadia  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gnagale  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Wassa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Moussokoura ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kadia  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-02-20T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":350000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":58333.33},{"due_date":"2009-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":58333.33},{"due_date":"2009-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":58333.33},{"due_date":"2009-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":58333.33},{"due_date":"2009-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":58333.33},{"due_date":"2009-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":58333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.67},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.67},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.67},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.67},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.67},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":233.33,"local_amount":116666.66,"processed_date":"2009-04-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:33:54Z","rounded_local_amount":118950.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36033686},{"amount":116.67,"local_amount":58333.33,"processed_date":"2009-05-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:42:26Z","rounded_local_amount":59475.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44621054},{"amount":116.67,"local_amount":58333.33,"processed_date":"2009-06-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:24:25Z","rounded_local_amount":59475.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53020019},{"amount":116.68,"local_amount":58333.33,"processed_date":"2009-07-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T19:22:11Z","rounded_local_amount":59475.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63242764},{"amount":116.65,"local_amount":58333.35,"processed_date":"2009-08-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T22:45:15Z","rounded_local_amount":59475.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73678321}],"funded_date":"2009-04-08T15:09:31Z","paid_date":"2009-09-15T22:45:15Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Daniel Kuey","image":669418}},{"id":96191,"name":"Las Poderosas Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El banco comunal \"Las PodeR.\" esta representado por la se\u00f1ora Carmen Cecilia y conformada por 12 miembros los cuales se dedican a actividades de venta de productos como dulces, tarjetas, cosm\u00e9ticos, electrodom\u00e9sticos y al servicio de mensajeria, secretaria y soldadura de arco y oxigeno.

Mongolia. She and her family live together in a ger, the Mongolian nomadic tent. Her husband operates a taxi service in their town. Currently, Tsetsgee operates a Mongolian fast food restaurant and second-hand shoe-trading business. She has been operating her restaurant since 2007, and has built a stable operation. She also opened a used clothing business in 2008. Over the years, she has been expanding her businesses. Her shoe repair business is seasonal, and does not operate during the winter.

She plans to start with sodas, then move on to water, carbonated water and lemon-flavored water. Ada will use her 1000 PEN (USD 325) to buy water tanks and installation tubes. \r\n\r\nAda became an Arariwa client when she was 18 and worked with the institution for three years. She returned about two years ago because she likes its mandatory savings program (in which clients are obliged to save 5% of their loan amount in a collective savings account). She has pledged to repay her Kiva loan in full and on time.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":309341,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Manufacturing","sector":"Manufacturing","themes":null,"use":"Buy water tanks and installation tubing for a new business manufacturing drinks and carbonated water.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Calca - Calca - Cusco","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":119,"posted_date":"2009-05-01T07:00:33Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ada Ysabel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-04-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":235.49},{"due_date":"2009-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":244.91},{"due_date":"2009-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":254.7},{"due_date":"2009-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":264.9}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.53},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.6},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.78},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.09}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":76.53,"local_amount":235.49,"processed_date":"2009-05-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T21:38:43Z","rounded_local_amount":237.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44409856},{"amount":79.76,"local_amount":245.4,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T18:08:17Z","rounded_local_amount":247.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52918314},{"amount":82.86,"local_amount":254.96,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T11:26:47Z","rounded_local_amount":257.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63139153},{"amount":85.85,"local_amount":264.15,"processed_date":"2009-08-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T12:19:55Z","rounded_local_amount":266.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73564772}],"funded_date":"2009-05-01T15:07:06Z","paid_date":"2009-09-15T12:19:55Z","journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tammea Arthur","image":1739710}},{"id":108495,"name":"Abduaziz","description":{"languages":["ru","en"],"texts":{"ru":"\u0410\u0431\u0434\u0443\u0430\u0437\u0438\u0437 \u0422\u043e\u0448\u043c\u0430\u0442\u043e\u0432 1962 \u0433\u043e\u0434\u0430 \u0440\u043e\u0436\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f, \u0436\u0435\u043d\u0430\u0442 \u0438\u043c\u0435\u0435\u0442 4 \u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0439. \u0412\u044b\u0441\u0448\u0435\u0433\u043e \u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0437\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f \u043d\u0435 \u0438\u043c\u0435\u0435\u0442. \u0414\u043e\u043c\u0430 \u0441\u043e\u0434\u0435\u0440\u0436\u0438\u0442 \u0441\u043a\u043e\u0442. \u0420\u0430\u0437\u0432\u043e\u0434\u0438\u0442 \u0441\u043a\u043e\u0442 \u0431\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0435 18 \u043b\u0435\u0442. \u0411\u0438\u0437\u043d\u0435\u0441\u043e\u043c \u0437\u0430\u043d\u044f\u043b\u0441\u044f \u043a\u043e\u0433\u0434\u0430 \u0436\u0435\u043d\u0438\u043b\u0441\u044f. \u0416\u0435\u043d\u0430 \u0434\u043e\u043c\u043e\u0445\u043e\u0437\u044f\u0439\u043a\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u043c\u043e\u0433\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u043c\u0443\u0436\u0435 \u0432 \u0431\u0438\u0437\u043d\u0435\u0441\u0435. \u0423\u0442\u0440\u043e\u043c \u0434\u043e\u0438\u0442 \u043a\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0432 \u0443\u0431\u0438\u0440\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u043a\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0432\u043d\u0438\u043a. \u041a\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0438\u0442 \u043f\u043e\u043b\u0443\u0447\u0438\u043b  \u043d\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u043a\u0443\u043f\u043a\u0438 \u043a\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0432. \u041a\u0430\u0436\u0434\u0443\u044e \u043a\u043e\u043d\u0435\u0446 \u043d\u0435\u0434\u0435\u043b\u0438  \u0435\u0441\u0442\u044c \u0440\u044b\u043d\u043e\u043a \u043a\u0443\u043f\u043b\u0438 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0430\u0436\u0438 \u0441\u043a\u043e\u0442\u0430. \u0410\u0431\u0434\u0443\u0430\u0437\u0438\u0437 \u0447\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0437 \u0442\u0440\u0438- \u0447\u0435\u0442\u044b\u0440\u0435 \u043c\u0435\u0441\u044f\u0446\u0430   \u0432\u044b\u0432\u043e\u0434\u0438\u0442 \u0441\u043a\u043e\u0442 \u043d\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0430\u0436\u0443 \u0438 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0435\u0442\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u0432 \u0437\u0430\u043c\u0435\u043d \u043c\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0434\u043d\u044f\u043a.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She buys her merchandise from catalogs and sells them to local customers.  She has a loyal group of customers who always come to for whatever products they need.  Jackeline doesn't rest on her laurels, though.  She's always looking for new customers because the company that supplies her merchandise rewards her with more points which, in turn, increases her income.  \r\n\r\nJackeline also earns money making and selling prepared foods which she sells in the neighborhood.  She has a loyal set of customers for this business, too, neighbors who come back to buy the meals she makes.  With her income from the two businesses, she can help her husband support the family.  (Her husband is a mechanic.)\r\n\r\nJackeline wants to buy tables and chairs so that she can expand her food business.

With the amount of 3,000 soles requested, she will purchase more beverages so that she can continue her business, and hopefully, have enough to buy a refrigerator as well.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":255900,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery

The group includes 12 people: Marcelina G. V. and Macedonia H. sell snacks; Gudelia G. O., Evelia Enedina M. G. and Efigenia P. V. sell sweets and fried foods; Emperatriz L\u00f3pez S., Luciana Teresa L\u00f3pez M., Susana L\u00f3pez M. and Maria Eugenia L\u00f3pez H. sell beauty products such as perfumes, creams, etc. from catalogs; Antonia M. S. weaves huipiles (a traditional article of clothing); Erica Nora R. M. sells shoes from a catalog; and Lucia Matilde O. N. has a permanent store where she sells gift items. \r\n\r\nGudelia is the group's representative. She is married and has three children. Three years ago, she started a business selling sweets, and since then it has provided her with very satisfactory profits. This income has allowed her to support her children in conjunction with her husband, so that they can go to school and learn a profession. Gudelia also plans to start selling food to students and to the public in general, in hope of further increasing her income. \r\n\r\nWith the loan provided by the Realidad Foundation, she will stock her business with a greater volume of goods, and she will also purchase ingredients to prepare food to sell, such as vegetables, meat, seafood, soft drinks, coffee, sugar, eggs, tortillas, cooking oil and gas for cooking. \r\n\r\nDo\u00f1a Gude, as she is called by those who know her well, is grateful for the support provided to her by the Foundation and by the other people involved in the financing, such as KIVA lenders. Her dream is to have a permanent shop where she can sell more products. She reports that she recommends her people, because she says they are responsible and dependable with their payments. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Patricia Linderman, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4800,"image":{"id":484899,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Purchasing products to sell and ingredients for prepared food","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"SANTIAGO PINOTEPA NACIONAL","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2010-02-08T18:10:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":4800,"lender_count":164,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Emperatriz","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gudelia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Susana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Eugenia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Antonia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Evelia Enedina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marcelina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Efigenia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Macedonia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Erica Nora","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lucia Matilde ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Luciana Teresa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-01-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":63000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":4800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":4500},{"due_date":"2010-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":4500},{"due_date":"2010-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":4500},{"due_date":"2010-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":4500},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":4500},{"due_date":"2010-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":4500},{"due_date":"2010-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":4500},{"due_date":"2010-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":4500},{"due_date":"2010-03-29T07:00:00Z","amount":4500},{"due_date":"2010-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":4500},{"due_date":"2010-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":4500},{"due_date":"2010-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":4500},{"due_date":"2010-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":4500},{"due_date":"2010-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":4500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":342.86},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":342.85},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":342.86},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":342.86},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":342.86},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":342.85},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":342.86},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":342.86},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":342.85},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":342.86},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":342.86},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":342.86},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":342.85},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":342.86}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":1500,"local_amount":19687.5,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:15:27Z","rounded_local_amount":19745.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123916695},{"amount":1500,"local_amount":19687.5,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:06:13Z","rounded_local_amount":19745.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128952427},{"amount":600,"local_amount":7875,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:58:31Z","rounded_local_amount":7898.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136681253},{"amount":1200,"local_amount":15750,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:22:53Z","rounded_local_amount":15796.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144715777}],"funded_date":"2010-02-09T12:27:07Z","paid_date":"2010-06-15T09:22:53Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Patricia Linderman","image":100107}},{"id":178743,"name":"Gregorio","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Cliente es minero artesanal se dedica mas de 10 a\u00f1os de experiencia en este negocio actividad que la permiti\u00f3 solventar su gastos familiares cuenta con buenas referencias de amigos y vecinos  por lo que se propone el financiamiento \nSolicita cr\u00e9dito para el mejoramiento de su domicilio  .

The family has their own house, built with wood and leaves, which is very characteristic of the central forest of Peru.\r\n\r\nWith the hope of enjoying his time with his children even more and living calmly when he gets older, Mene works tirelessly. \"Now, being young, I want to work as much as I can, to the point my energy allows me. If I waste my money, how will I live? For this reason, I invest wisely the money that reaches my hands\", he mentions.\r\n\r\nWith the help of his wife, for the last 10 years he has cultivated coffee, plantains, avocados, yucca, and corn on his own land. These products are quite profitable for him, since he cares for them with dedication in order to obtain good harvests. In the future, he plans to plant in greater quantity, and furthermore, he desires to set up a grocery store in a space in his home.

the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

is 47-year-old Foday. He is married and has four children, aged 19, 16, 15 and 13 years. In 1986, Foday established his used-clothing business. He began his business after moving from Kono (where mining is the main economic activity) to Makeni (where petty trading is the main business activity). \r\n\r\nWorking seven days a week and 11 hours a day, he earns about 1,200,000 Sierra Leone leones (Le) every month from this business. He would like a loan in the amount of Le 5,000,000. Foday has already received and successfully repaid one loan, and now requires a new loan in order to buy used clothing: T-shirts (two bales @ Le550,000), ladies blouses (two bales @ Le700,000), skirts (two bales @ Le650,000) and jeans jackets (one bale @ Le1,200,000). \r\n\r\nHe hopes that this loan will enable him to increase his monthly profits by approximately Le 300,000. In the future, Foday plans to open a big shop and an account for his old age. He is excited and hopes to finish his building and educate his children. Competition is keen but he usually buys good products that meet his customers' demands.   \r\n\r\nHe is assisted by his family members, and he serves 50 customers per day because of his quality stock.  He travels to Freetown to buy his business stock by public transport. He is hardworking and honest. He thanks you for your support.  \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1150,"image":{"id":875239,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Used Clothing","sector":"Clothing","themes":["Conflict Zones"],"use":"To buy used clothing: T-shirts (two bales @ Le550,000), ladies blouses (two bales @ Le700,000), skirts  (two bales @ Le650,000) and jeans jackets (one bale @ Le1,200,000).","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SL","country":"Sierra Leone","town":"Makeni","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"8.883333 -12.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":148,"posted_date":"2011-10-10T05:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1150,"lender_count":45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Foday","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-09-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"SLL","disbursal_amount":5000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":1150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":500000},{"due_date":"2011-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":500000},{"due_date":"2011-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":500000},{"due_date":"2012-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":500000},{"due_date":"2012-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":500000},{"due_date":"2012-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":500000},{"due_date":"2012-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":500000},{"due_date":"2012-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":500000},{"due_date":"2012-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":500000},{"due_date":"2012-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":500000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":115},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":115},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":115},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":115},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":115},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":115},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":115},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":115},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":115},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":115}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":230,"local_amount":1000000,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:23:14Z","rounded_local_amount":1019137.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244513943},{"amount":115,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T09:29:21Z","rounded_local_amount":509568.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250721769},{"amount":115,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T09:40:12Z","rounded_local_amount":509568.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257124676},{"amount":115,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-16T07:49:06Z","rounded_local_amount":509568.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263505582},{"amount":115,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T08:38:51Z","rounded_local_amount":509568.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":269974693},{"amount":115,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-16T08:13:37Z","rounded_local_amount":509568.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276815268},{"amount":115,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-16T08:04:38Z","rounded_local_amount":509568.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283444334},{"amount":230,"local_amount":1000000,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-16T08:01:54Z","rounded_local_amount":1019137.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287537073}],"funded_date":"2011-11-16T03:23:21Z","paid_date":"2012-07-16T08:01:54Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Michelle Archer","image":162079}},{"id":347045,"name":"Nhung","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Nhung is 50 years old and married.

This 26-year-old Bahati K. from Tukuyu. She is single, and since 2005 has made a living running a clothes shop. She buys clothes wholesale and sell them retail to her customers.\r\n\r\nShe works at the business for nine hours a day, seven days a week, earning about $750 a month from her business. Bahati is requesting a loan of $775 to buy additional clothes for her business. In the future, her goal is to increase quantity and range of items she has to sell to her customers. Bahati thanks you for your support!\r\n\r\nABOUT SELFINA:\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":255951,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing

(Pro Economic Development) group consists of 10 members, the majority of whom live in San Mart\u00edn, district of Los Olivos, Peru. The group is on its fourth loan cycle, and every one of the members is a mother who gets up very early to dedicate herself to her businesses (selling chicken, beauty products, among other items) and in the afternoon spends time with her children. Each member will use the loan to continue investing in her business. <p>\r\nThe founder of the group, Nelly Q. C.

With her hard work and sacrifice, Nelly wants to complete construction on her home so she can rent the rooms and make professionals out of all her children. <p>\r\nThe treasurer of the group, Flor R. S. (the woman in the blue sweater in the first row), is a young mother of two small children, ages 7 and 3, who wants to have her own home, since she currently lives with her in-laws. She goes out every morning to sell beauty products, lingerie, etc. <p>\r\nFinally, but no less important, is the group's secretary, Esmeralda F. P. (the woman in pink in the first row). She used to sell all kinds of items outdoors, but with a lot of effort she was able to get her own post selling chicken in the market. At first it was difficult because she didn't know how to carve the chicken, but now she loves her job. With the loan from Kiva partner EDAPROSPO she will continue investing in her business so that in the future she'll be able to buy a small plot of land and make professionals out of her three small children.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Marty Greenstein, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3025,"image":{"id":328005,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Grow their businesses","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Los Olivos","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.851111 -76.390556","type":"point"}},"partner_id":93,"posted_date":"2009-06-05T04:30:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":3025,"lender_count":67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Rosa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nelly","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Luz Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Esmeralda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Olga","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Flor Carolina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ricardina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Adela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alejandrina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Luz","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-05-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":9150,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":3025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":2287.5},{"due_date":"2009-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":2287.5},{"due_date":"2009-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":2287.5},{"due_date":"2009-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":2287.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":756.25},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":756.25},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":756.25},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":756.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":756.25,"local_amount":2287.5,"processed_date":"2009-06-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T20:06:26Z","rounded_local_amount":2287.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52949922},{"amount":756.25,"local_amount":2287.5,"processed_date":"2009-07-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T12:51:05Z","rounded_local_amount":2287.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63166891},{"amount":756.25,"local_amount":2287.5,"processed_date":"2009-08-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T14:08:05Z","rounded_local_amount":2287.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73592252},{"amount":756.25,"local_amount":2287.5,"processed_date":"2009-09-08T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T15:42:48Z","rounded_local_amount":2287.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87027463}],"funded_date":"2009-06-16T15:18:20Z","paid_date":"2009-10-15T15:42:48Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Marty Greenstein","image":null}},{"id":116719,"name":"Michael","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Michael S. is twenty-six years old.

Gina has been engaged in her business for over one year and earns approximately 1500 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Gina joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Gina has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5000 PHP from GDMPC. This previous loan was used to purchase new items to expand her product offering. Gina is requesting a new loan of 5000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the second loan taken out by Gina from GDMPC.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. A civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged an already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

From an early age, this young man has fought to provide the best for his family.  He lives in the house he inherited from his parents with his siblings:  Alba (age 20), Carlos (age 18), Yonatan (age 15), and Paola (age 13).  He is willing to work very hard in order to fulfill his duties as the oldest brother.\r\n<p>\r\nAt the age of 16, Jhon had to confront by himself the abandonment by his parents.  Being the oldest brother, he was forced to leave high school and begin working as a tricycle driver.  This was the only way he knew to be able to feed his siblings.\r\n<p>\r\nOver time, he managed to put together enough money to buy a motorcycle taxi, which enabled his family to get ahead.  With the income he generated from this business activity, Jhon was able to pay for the college and high school expenses of his siblings.  He looks after them like a father, which is why he gains much admiration and respect.\r\n<p>\r\nWhat he enjoys most about his job is the freedom his schedule provides since he has to be aware that his siblings have everything they need.  Jhon has been in business for eight years and believes the hardest part of his job is having to work late at night.  During that time, he usually has a large amount of money that he has to take home.  With time he hopes to open a more stable business, such as a grocery store.

This purchase will enable her to increase her sales and earn more so she can provide her children with a good education.   \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International:\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes having been a key post along the Silk Road and having witnessed the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to epic mountain passes, a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC, and communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still lives in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with access to the varied financial services they need.

Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She always has a lot of clients come to her store in order to send their cloth for sewing as they need. From this business, Mrs. Men could generate an income of approximately $2.50 USD each day to cover her daily expenses. \r\n\r\nRecently, her potatoes are not growing well because they are ravaged by insects and lawn.

The distribution of farming inputs is part of One Acre Fund\u2019s integrated agriculture package, which includes training, reliable input supply (such as fertilizer and seeds), credit and insurance.\r\n\r\nWith income from her maize sales, Joyce will repay the loan.\r\n\r\nIn 2012, the members of Wambwa group will each plant between \u00bd and 1 acre of maize.\r\n\r\nWambwa group members appear in the photograph along with the field officer who appears on the far left."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":929610,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To source farming inputs, such as seeds and fertilizer, at low prices for the 2012 planting season.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Webuye","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.616667 34.766667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2011-11-27T07:40:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":600,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Felistus","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Florence","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gladys","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hellen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Joyce","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Margaret","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-11-27T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":53200,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53200}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":600}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":600,"local_amount":53200,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-27T10:17:14Z","rounded_local_amount":54060,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315681069}],"funded_date":"2011-12-08T08:54:37Z","paid_date":"2012-11-27T10:17:14Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":367556,"name":"Lhagvadulam","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lhagvadulam is 26 years old and lives with her husband and three kids in a ger (a Mongolian yurt) in Ulaanbaatar City, Mongolia.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <p> \r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <p>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is a businesswoman\u2014when her mother died 10 years ago, Maria took over the store she left behind.  She had to quickly learn the rhythm of the market and how to increase her capital.  Increasing her capital gave her the opportunity to complete more orders and hire 2 people to help her.  She sells chicken and also delivers it to several nearby restaurants.  Even though every day the work is the same, her job gives her energy.  However, it is tiresome to make deliveries that are far away;  because of this, her next goal is to purchase a car.  This will make her job easier and also help her increase her profit and stop paying for transportation every day.  This is Maria\u2019s 10th loan with MFP in the past 6 years.  She is very grateful and she found not only other members within her community bank, but actual friends, which is the most important thing.
