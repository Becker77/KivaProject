She loves and treasures her children and will go the extra mile to make sure that they are comfortable. Sally\u2019s primary source of income has come from selling milk, crop farming, and poultry farming. Through these ventures she has been able to earn a decent income. She is a very determined and dedicated farmer who has been farming for 10 years, and throughout she has never regretted going into farming. Although this humble mum has been making profits, not everything has been good. She faces financial challenges, and because the Kericho area has proven a ready market for cereals, she is kindly seeking a loan to buy cereal for re-sale and thus improve her income. Sally\u2019s upbringing was challenging, and she has faced many economic problems. But this ever-smiling mum has been making great improvements, and she believes that through your loan she will be able to realize her goal of improving her living conditions and transforming her life. Through Juhudi Kilimo, Sally has received training and proven to be honest and disciplined with finances. She intends to fully repay the loan with the profits from her business.

She has one son who lives in her home.  Every day she works the land and takes care of her crops.  She has done this work since her childhood.  She grows potatoes, peas, and lately she has started growing flowers with the help of her husband since she noticed that her neighbors are doing well in this business.  For 3 years, she has grown flowers.  She rents plots of land where she had grown potatoes previously to take advantage of the fertile soil, and she only has to worry about fumigating.  In this way, she reduces her investment costs and tries to save her proftis so she can make progress with her other porducts and be a successful farmer.  She can't sit easily at home because she is a dynamic and enterprising woman and is always active.  Teolinda wants to buy a stand in the market in the city so she can sell her products herself and gain a lot more than she does now.  Teolinda has been the secretary of her communal bank for several consecutive cycles.  She supports the treasurer in collecting their payments.

His mother has a beauty salon, his father sells merchandise, as do his sisters and aunts.  At first, Julio Cesar helped his mother with all her businesses.  However, he now has his own enterprise:  a phone call service that he located on a street near his mother\u2019s beauty salon entrance.  It is in the busy Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar neighborhood, just south of Barranquilla.\n\nHis business allows him to pay for his own expenses to become a pharmacist, and not have to depend on his mother for his education.  This affords him the opportunity to live a healthy and pleasant social life with his girlfriend, without being a financial burden on his family.\n\nThis year, he has received 2 loans from the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation.  Currently, he is requesting 1,300,000 Colombian pesos to invest in modernizing his cellular equipment and to supply his business with phone covers and other supplies to sell.  His dream is to also have his own pharmacy, since in 6 months he will have attained all the legal requirements to be a pharmacist.  For these reasons, he puts forth a great effort as a hard-working student to complete his goal.\n\nHis great challenge is to practice excellent professionalism, so that he can return all the support that his family has provided.  His mother, sister and aunt have especially helped him out, particularly when he\u2019s had to be absent in order to complete his studies.\n\nJulio Cesar is a 21-year old young man who is very mature and an excellent member of the family.\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Mary Lynn Malaby, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":538401,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Call Center","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"To buy cell phone equipment, and to supply his business with phone covers and accessories to sell.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2010-06-16T13:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":675,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Julio Cesar","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-06-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1300000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":99043},{"due_date":"2010-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":99281},{"due_date":"2010-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":101184},{"due_date":"2010-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":103123},{"due_date":"2010-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":105099},{"due_date":"2010-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":107114},{"due_date":"2011-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":109167},{"due_date":"2011-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":111259},{"due_date":"2011-03-09T08:00:00Z","amount":113392},{"due_date":"2011-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":115565},{"due_date":"2011-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":117780},{"due_date":"2011-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":117993}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.43},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.55},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.53},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.55},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.57},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.62},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.68},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.77},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.87},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.01},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.15},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.27}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":51.43,"local_amount":99043,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:12:03Z","rounded_local_amount":99663.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159636230},{"amount":51.55,"local_amount":99281,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:17:22Z","rounded_local_amount":99903.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166850325},{"amount":52.53,"local_amount":101184,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:08:15Z","rounded_local_amount":101818.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172117083},{"amount":53.55,"local_amount":103123,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T14:01:03Z","rounded_local_amount":103769.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177410950},{"amount":110.19,"local_amount":212213,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T13:14:24Z","rounded_local_amount":213543.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188688211},{"amount":56.68,"local_amount":109167,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T03:39:14Z","rounded_local_amount":109851.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191427445},{"amount":116.64,"local_amount":224651,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:09:19Z","rounded_local_amount":226059.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201288870},{"amount":60.01,"local_amount":115565,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:05:34Z","rounded_local_amount":116289.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206157027},{"amount":122.42,"local_amount":235773,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:18:23Z","rounded_local_amount":237251.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211230039}],"funded_date":"2010-06-19T16:59:17Z","paid_date":"2011-06-15T11:18:23Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":211433,"name":"Christine","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Christine L. is currently in the business of selling fish at the market and is requesting a loan to stock more fish to sell.

Maize farming and dairy farming are the most popular and lucrative economic activities for people in the Kitale area. Milk, maize and other dairy products are her main source of income. Gladys is seeking a loan to venture into horticultural farming. The new venture will marry well into dairy farming, and the combination of the two activities will bring him and her family untold benefits. With your loan, the horticultural farm she will start will complement the existing dairy farm in the following ways: income from dairy will pay for horticultural expenses as crops mature; lump sum income from crop farming will be rolled back into the business to buy more cows and plant more crops coming season; by-products from crop farming such as maize stalks, cobs and off-coloured grains will be used as dairy feeds; by-products from dairy such as cow dung will be used for biogas generation and manure for planting crops.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nTajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Her husband, Catalino, is working as a driver and they are living a peaceful life in San Isidro, Ilagan, Isabela. They were blessed with four children: Crisanto, a 15-year-old high-school student; Christian, a 12-year-old also in high school; and Chrisilyn, 10, and Christine, 8, who are both in the elementary level of school. The family has a good family relationship and she prays that they can sustain their bonding no matter how many difficulties life may bring.\r\n<p>\r\nMarissa is a vendor of native snacks like \u201ckakanin\u201d (rice cake) in their village. She sells different snacks and with her diligence, she was able to earn a weekly income of PHP 1,000.00.  Her income is being used as rolling capital and buys the necessary ingredients like glutinous rice, coconut and sugar. Her request of PHP 4,000.00 will serve as additional capital for the improvement of her business.  She hopes that her request will be granted for it will really help her not only to support her business but also in sending her children to school and to provide the needs of their family.

He lives in the Pantasma neighborhood of Managua and works as a security guard.  In addition to working, he sells sour-milk to augment his low salary.

This young man of twenty-eight years sells goods, and he also has a kiosk where he sells cell phone minutes.  Selling cell phone minutes is quite common in this area.  He's a very active young businessman, always on the lookout for opportunities. Thanks to the hot climate he can also sell men\u2019s and women\u2019s sandals.  In addition, he makes pandebonos (a bread made with cheese and corn meal) in his and his brother\u2019s oven, and sells them on the street.  \r\n\r\nDavid has applied for this loan so he can buy more merchandise.  He plans to get four dozen pairs of men\u2019s sandals and four dozen pairs of women\u2019s sandals that he has orders for, as well as a sack of meal, twenty-four pounds of cheese, and assorted ingredients for his pandebonos business.\r\n\r\nDavid went into business twelve years ago by getting pandebonos from the supplier and selling them on the street.  He says it was hard at first because he didn\u2019t have enough capital and the work was hard, so he really had to sacrifice to keep it going.  He kept on saving and managed to buy his own oven, in concert with his brother.  Later, with his new savings, he started bringing hand-made sandals from San Jacinto, a municipality in Bolivia, to distribute in the towns of the Atl\u00e1ntico department.  He added yet another business to increase his income: selling clothing and other goods, and he even succeeded in putting a cell-phone-minutes kiosk in his house so his wife could work.\r\n\r\nThis is David\u2019s second loan from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  Since starting out with the organization he has been able to open new markets and expand the range of products that he offers.  Looking to the future, he hopes to continue working to improve the quality of life for himself and his family by getting their own house, his greatest dream and biggest challenge.

For that reason she is asking FAPE for a loan to buy  another sales cart to sell hotdogs because she\u2019s done well and feels the need to add another tool.\r\n\r\nSandra thanks God and FAPE for the support they\u2019ve given her through the loan.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":593444,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To buy a hotdog cart.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GT","country":"Guatemala","town":"Tecp\u00e1n, Chimaltenango","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15.5 -90.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":97,"posted_date":"2010-09-01T00:00:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":750,"lender_count":26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sandra Gricelda Julisa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-08-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GTQ","disbursal_amount":6000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2010-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2010-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2010-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2011-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2011-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2011-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2011-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2011-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2011-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2011-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2011-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-20T08:16:50Z","rounded_local_amount":503.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172712574},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T13:45:10Z","rounded_local_amount":503.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177396335},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T13:54:52Z","rounded_local_amount":503.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182534891},{"amount":125,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T03:08:13Z","rounded_local_amount":1006.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191414973},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:37:26Z","rounded_local_amount":503.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195833567},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T10:56:08Z","rounded_local_amount":503.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201276100},{"amount":61.25,"local_amount":490,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:08:06Z","rounded_local_amount":493.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211216319},{"amount":188.75,"local_amount":1510,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-17T07:46:37Z","rounded_local_amount":1520.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221958310},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-20T07:54:33Z","rounded_local_amount":503.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227659098}],"funded_date":"2010-09-01T03:39:39Z","paid_date":"2011-09-20T07:54:33Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":231935,"name":"Raponsel","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Raponsel O. is from the village of Sta.

This urban parish, located just ten minutes from Portoviejo, the capital of the Manabi province, is filled with stories and it's where the Maria Asuncion loan group meets every couple of weeks. \r\n\r\nAna has been a member of the loan group for 10 years. She likes it because it is always easy to obtain a loan. She is 56 years old and lives with her partner, with whom she has had 7 children. All of them are now grown up and none of them live with her, just a nephew who is like a son to her. Her husband is a taxi driver. \r\n\r\nShe owns a telephone booth and a fast food business. She has had it for three years and things are going well because she is the only one in this segment. She works every day from 8am to 11pm.

Fortunata and Gudelia have been members for six years; Pamela joined four months ago.  In that time they have learned about saving, punctuality, and responsibility.\r\n<p>\r\nFortunata is forty and has three children. She transports children to school. She started this business two years ago. Previously, she sold shoes and clothing at the market. A few years ago Fortunata had a very difficult pregnancy and was unable to work for an extended period of time. She decided to start the transportation business with a loan from the community bank because it gave her an opportunity to work without putting too much stress in her body.\r\n<p>\r\nGudelia is 62 years old. She has four children all of whom are successful. One child is a police officer, one is an engineer, another is a secretary, and the oldest is an administrator for the regional government. Gudelia has owned a small grocery store for many years. In the past she traveled to different markets buying and selling her products, but now she has been able to open a store in an established location.\r\n<p>\r\nPamela is 24 years old and has two young children.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nTajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

H. and Maritza del Socorro O. G..\r\n\r\nThe ended up involved with Adim because another person told them about the types of loans they received from an organization with confidence in the honor of its participants.\r\n\r\nThis group originates in the city of Masay, located in the San Ram\u00f3n region, and is comprised of the following members:\r\n\r\nMargarita sells fruits and vegetables from her home.  She offers fruit during the season when they are the cheapest.  She buys them at the market then sells them at retail, which is when she can garner a better profit.  She is married and the mother of two young sons who work independently.  They are no longer in school, but completed their educations up to secondary school.\r\n\r\nEsther B., another member, also sells vegetables and peeled fruit that she markets to repeat customers.  She is known as a merchant throughout the community.  She buys her products in Masaya both at wholesale and at retail.  She has two young sons who study at the school closest to her house.  She wants them to finish their educations so they can have opportunities that she has never known.\r\n\r\nMaritza del Socorro is the coordinator of the group.  She is a young mother of two school-aged children.  She has a small stall in the Tipitapa market and works from early in the morning, returning home in the afternoon to care for her children and tend to the home.  She dreams of providing educations for her children and of making improvements to her house.  She notes that she is happy to work with Adim because she has never had the opportunity to obtain financing due to lack of collateral.  Now, she is going to do right by the institution that has shown confidence in her abilities.\r\n\r\nThese women take credit on Mondays, which they consider the best day to do so.  After the weekend, sales are better, and this way they secure the installment payment toward the loan.  \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Mary Lynn Malaby, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":327359,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To purchase fruits and vegetables.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Masaya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.966667 -86.1","type":"point"}},"partner_id":120,"posted_date":"2009-06-03T01:30:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maritza Del Socorro","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ester","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Margarita Antonia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-05-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":7500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":1071.43},{"due_date":"2009-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1071.43},{"due_date":"2009-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1071.43},{"due_date":"2009-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1071.43},{"due_date":"2009-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1071.43},{"due_date":"2009-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1071.43},{"due_date":"2009-08-31T07:00:00Z","amount":1071.42}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.14},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.15},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.14},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.14},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.14},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.15},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.14}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":57.14,"local_amount":1071.43,"processed_date":"2009-06-08T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T16:19:12Z","rounded_local_amount":1092.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52889217},{"amount":57.14,"local_amount":1071.43,"processed_date":"2009-06-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T16:19:43Z","rounded_local_amount":1092.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52889218},{"amount":57.14,"local_amount":1071.43,"processed_date":"2009-07-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T09:26:21Z","rounded_local_amount":1092.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63110544},{"amount":57.14,"local_amount":1071.43,"processed_date":"2009-07-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T09:27:04Z","rounded_local_amount":1092.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63110545},{"amount":57.15,"local_amount":1071.43,"processed_date":"2009-08-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T09:31:47Z","rounded_local_amount":1092.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73531980},{"amount":57.15,"local_amount":1071.43,"processed_date":"2009-08-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T09:33:01Z","rounded_local_amount":1092.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73531981},{"amount":57.14,"local_amount":1071.42,"processed_date":"2009-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T09:34:22Z","rounded_local_amount":1092.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73531982}],"funded_date":"2009-06-03T03:07:05Z","paid_date":"2009-09-15T09:34:22Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":116379,"name":"Constance","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"H.

It appears that, in doing so, Jose indeed made a wise career move: the loan he is requesting today is over twice the amount of the first loan he took out as a motoconcho. \r\n\r\nJose is the coordinator for the Bank of Hope group called Unidos Podemos (United We Can) Group 13. He is pictured on the far left of the photo along with the four other borrowers in his group.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1300,"image":{"id":348689,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits &

She is 42 years old. Enecita is the group leader of a two-member group loan offered by GDMPC. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are each responsible for paying back the loan of their fellow group member if she is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nEnecita is married and has four school-aged children. To make a living, Enecita owns and operates a furniture business, providing items of furniture to local community members. Enecita has been engaged in her business for over fifteen years and earns approximately $135 a month from this activity.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Enecita joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. Enecita has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from GDMPC. Enecita is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional materials. This will be her 4th loan from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay the tuition fees of her children and to supply her family's daily needs. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

C. is a married woman who lives in Hda. Socorro, Brgy. Mabini, Escalante City, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating three business ventures: the buying and selling of dry goods, vegetable vending and food vending. Her husband, Edgardo, who is 62 years old, is a retired employee who helps in his wife's business activities. They have five children who are 25 to 37 years old. \r\n\r\nMildred joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2005 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 4 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Mildred has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 5,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 3,500, thus lifting her family's standard of living. This time, for her 5th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 10,000 which she intends to use to buy dry goods to sell so that she can continue to save for the future expansion of her business. Mildred D. C. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She lives in Bugho, Bagalnga, Compostela, Cebu. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2005 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. \r\n\r\nBy working hard in her 'abaca' weaving and hog-raising businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 4,100. Flora is now borrowing PHP 13,500 so that she can buy frames and stocks for 'abaca'.  This will be her 13th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 11,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. \r\n\r\nFlora aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the  Dungganon way.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\n\r\n In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams.

She is married and the mother of four children, from 5 to 24 years of age. She has been working in the commerce sector for over ten years. She devotes all her time to selling ice and chickens. What has driven her to choose this business are the problems in life concerned with earning an income.

In this group we can find clients who speak Kachikel Maya, Tzu\u2019tujil Maya, and Spanish. They are respectful of each other, and when one doesn\u2019t understand the language of another, they continue in Spanish. The communication and organization of this group is also outstanding. They appear to be an organized and accomplished communal bank. This harmony has been achieved over a period of almost six years, during which they have solicited eleven loans.<p> These clients have also developed as businesswomen. Many of them are successful raisers of livestock. Most of them raise and sell pigs, cows, and chickens.<p> A considerable number of the group\u2019s clients usually decide to buy one or two bulls, between four and six pigs, and twenty or forty chickens. For example, Mar\u00eda C. is going use her loan to buy four pigs and twenty chickens. The ladies feel this is what is most advisable for them and that this is what is in highest demand in the market.<p> Las Dalias is a group that, through the years, has formed an unbeatable friendship. One lady commented that one of the many benefits of working in the methodology of communal banks is that all the participants know each other like family. Josefina C. commented that if one of the participants falls ill, the rest get foodstuffs together to take to the family of the sick person.<p> This communal bank is a good example of the success of micro credit and the methodology of communal banks because the members developed ties of friendship and have become successful entrepreneurs. Because of this we need to continue supporting them so that they can continue advancing. <p> <b> Translated from Spanish by Jennifer Day, Kiva Volunteer. <p><\/b><P>Las se\u00f1oras que conforman el banco comunal Las Dalias son un ejemplo para el mundo en lo que respecta tolerancia.

She buys small livestock (sheep and pigs), fattens them, and sells them.  Her first loan was for 300.00 PEN which she used to buy livestock (sheep with black faces) to fatten and sell at the fairs in Zepita and Yunguyo.  Now she needs a loan for an additional 1800.00 PEN.  She promises to pay it back in 4 payments.  With the money she would be able to buy more sheep and bulls to be able to fatten and sell at the fairs in Yunguyo and Zepita.

She started this business through an aunt who sold these products.  Her aunt recommended it to her to see if it would give her results.  She decided to promote this well known product.  She started selling a packet of medicine with a 25% discount on the price of Q1,000.00, which generated Q200.00 of earnings.  Some relatives lent her Q1,000.00 to start her business as a street vendor.  For over six months she was selling her products door to door to see what her earnings would be.  She took the initiative of renting a space in an independent manner.  It has gone well for her.  She waits on an average of 14 customers a day with a consumption of Q22.00.  As her sales have increased, the business where she gets her medicinal products has given her a 42% discount on her purchases.\r\n\r\nHer dream is to pursue a university career.  As her family has scant resources, her studies since primary school have had to take place on the week end.  She has worked to pay for her studies.

She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 29 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherpeople, and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2625,"image":{"id":601806,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

Her husband is a lawyer.  She has a degree in Education and works as a teacher at the school in the city of Tosagua.  She also sells Lebel products (beauty products, cosmetics, perfumes and ladies' accessories).  She sells her products on the weekends and in the evenings when she can.  She takes advantage of the offers since she can buy at half price and then sell at the real price, so earns a good profit.  She delivers on credit and collects payment every two weeks.  She has been in this business for seven months and it is going well for her.\r\n\r\nThe loan will be used to buy perfumes, creams and cosmetics.  This is her first term in the communal bank which she likes because loans are granted quickly and without many requirements.\r\n\r\nHer goal is to own a bazaar.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3150,"image":{"id":797630,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To buy perfumes, creams and cosmetics.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Portoviejo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2011-06-24T06:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":3150,"lender_count":80,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Adriana Karolina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gina Piedad","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Magdalena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ivonne Paola","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Cecilia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jenny Lucety","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mayra Lorena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Carina Victoria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Margarita Adela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Erwin Jos\u00e9","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juan Pablo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-06-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":3135,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":3150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":391.88},{"due_date":"2011-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":391.88},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":391.88},{"due_date":"2011-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":391.88},{"due_date":"2011-08-29T07:00:00Z","amount":391.88},{"due_date":"2011-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":391.88},{"due_date":"2011-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":391.88},{"due_date":"2011-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":391.84}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":393.76},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":393.75},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":393.76},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":393.75},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":393.76},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":393.75},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":393.76},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":393.71}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":787.51,"local_amount":783.76,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:48:30Z","rounded_local_amount":787.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221668224},{"amount":1181.27,"local_amount":1175.64,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T09:08:41Z","rounded_local_amount":1181.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227036971},{"amount":787.51,"local_amount":783.76,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:02:38Z","rounded_local_amount":787.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232797535},{"amount":393.71,"local_amount":391.84,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:14:41Z","rounded_local_amount":393.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238608630}],"funded_date":"2011-06-26T06:20:53Z","paid_date":"2011-11-15T10:14:41Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sherry Bess","image":833485}},{"id":313927,"name":"Analy","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Analy is 35 years old and married with 6 children.

In this place he operates his business, a leather goods shop where he makes purses. \r\n\r\nMany years ago, Alex began his first experience with the market and entrepreneurship, selling puddings from store to store. In the course of this activity, he met a woman who taught him how to make purses. Alex was very interested in learning, and because of this he practiced the skill with great frequency at this lady's home, ultimately moving in with her and working with her on an ongoing basis. They strove to get ahead, each with their own business, but united in the effort to achieve well-being in their household. Now, Alex's business is 10 years old, and his purses are sold in the cities of Barranquilla, Santa Marta and Cartagena, three stars of the Caribbean Sea which nestle by the beaches along the coast. He has 3 employees, including the man who cuts the leather, the designer and the man who glues the pieces. He was previously located in the downtown area of Soledad, but since 1 year ago he has been working in a neighborhood of the municipality, closer to Barranquilla.\r\n\r\nHis goal for the future is to expand into new markets, so he can see his children become prosperous and provide them with chances for success, helping them to become professionals. In the meantime, he is continuing to work with dedication and looking for ways to increase his working capital in order to serve his growing customer base. For this reason, he applied for a Kiva loan, his first financing with the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation. He will use the loan to buy a sewing machine and raw materials to manufacture a range of products, because he plans to expand his production and enter the markets in Sincelejo and Valledupar, other cities of the coastal region. Alex's financial status is consistent with the business he operates, and it reflects the good times his business is experiencing. His sales cover all expenses and give a consistent net profit margin of no less than 6.85%, while his accounts receivable turn over every 5 days and inventory every 20.  \r\n

He has been selling food since childhood because his father was not able to support the family due to frequent illnesses.

This resulted in frequent warnings and harassment from local authorities concerned about public order in central city streets.  Such disruptions greatly affected his earnings, down to the basic ability to earn enough to feed himself and his family.\r\n<p> After learning about the collateral-free credit program at MLF MicroInvest he became a member in 2002 and obtained a loan for $100. Gradually he increased the variety of his offerings and most importantly was able to obtain a permanent trading stall at the central city market. All this showed his dedication to the MicroInvest program and his discipline.

He has been able to accomplish all of this through the economic benefit that he has received in the last 25 years by getting up early every day to distribute fodder (animal feed) that he has harvested.

Married mothers of at least 8 children, they are on average 50 years old and are either related to each other or neighbors. They sell clothes, shoes, and jewelry. In order to rectify not having enough funds for their business, the members of the Kokadi\u00e8 group turned to Soro Yiriwaso\u2019s credit program five years ago. The loan amount has gone from 50,000 CFA francs at the first loan to 125,000 CFA francs for the twelfth group loan. The current loan will be used to buy in-style clothes and jewelry at wholesale to be resold. The women of the Kokadi\u00e8 group stock up at the market in Bamako (the capital of the republic of Mali). They sell their products at the large market in Koutiala where they have space (kiosks or a converted shed). With this new loan, they plan on earning 140,000 CFA francs each over the term. In addition to repaying the loan, they will use a portion of their profits to pay for the needs of their family and the schooling of their children. In the near future, they plan to seek individual loans to open a clothing boutique.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Sherry W., Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1550,"image":{"id":299692,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"To purchase clothing and jewelry","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Koutiala","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2009-05-01T07:00:36Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1550,"lender_count":54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Fanta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Awa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Djeneba     ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Awa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Awa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kadia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-03-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":750000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2009-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2009-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2009-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2009-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2009-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":125000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":258.33},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":258.33},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":258.33},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":258.33},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":258.33},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":258.35}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":516.67,"local_amount":250000,"processed_date":"2009-05-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:39:29Z","rounded_local_amount":254034.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44621181},{"amount":258.33,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2009-06-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:22:04Z","rounded_local_amount":127017.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53020141},{"amount":258.32,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2009-07-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T19:19:38Z","rounded_local_amount":127017.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63242896},{"amount":258.33,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2009-08-08T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T22:43:02Z","rounded_local_amount":127017.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73678579},{"amount":258.35,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2009-09-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T03:55:54Z","rounded_local_amount":127017.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87112519}],"funded_date":"2009-05-16T07:33:58Z","paid_date":"2009-10-16T03:55:54Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sherry W.","image":null}},{"id":104123,"name":"Vaofetu","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Vaofetu F., 47, is married with five children.

Because of her need to contribute to the household income, and motivated by herself, she launched her own general store with her 300.00 PEN loan. She obtained great results from the beginning because of her high-quality products, her reasonable prices, and her excellent customer service. She still runs this same business, which is located in her house. Her main customers are her neighbors. With this 1,600.00 PEN loan, she will purchase more products to stock her shop with rice and sugar by the kilo, crates of eggs, personal hygiene products, household cleaning supplies, crates of soft drinks, candy, and other products to keep her customers satisfied. She now feels very happy with the work and service that she provides, and she gives thanks to Manuela Ramos for giving support to people like her who want to work and get ahead in life.

When she began, it was because of the need to support her family and get ahead.  Her sons' work consists in buying and selling cattle and it produces good profits.  This is her second loan with the institution and she plans to buy clothing, irons, and blenders to deliver to her customers since she sells them on credit and the appliances she only sells on order since they are more expensive.  With this she expects to increase sales, gather more customers and continue to improve her finances.  All of this is thanks to Afodenic's help with the financing.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":427931,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"To buy a variety of clothing, an iron, to increase sales.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Managua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.150833 -86.268333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":98,"posted_date":"2009-11-16T23:50:17Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":775,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Glenda Esther","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-11-12T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":16000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2010-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2010-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2010-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2010-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2010-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2010-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2010-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2010-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2010-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2010-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2010-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":1333.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":64.58},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":64.59},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.58},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.58},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.59},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.58},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.58},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.59},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.58},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.58},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":64.58},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":64.59}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":75.55,"local_amount":1559.78,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T10:59:01Z","rounded_local_amount":1564.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110601779},{"amount":151.49,"local_amount":3127.62,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T09:52:29Z","rounded_local_amount":3136.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118003224},{"amount":49.13,"local_amount":1014.23,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T07:50:11Z","rounded_local_amount":1017.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128874294},{"amount":60.65,"local_amount":1252.23,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T09:30:29Z","rounded_local_amount":1255.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136604192},{"amount":66.39,"local_amount":1370.63,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T08:31:07Z","rounded_local_amount":1374.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144639654},{"amount":65.41,"local_amount":1350.38,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:01:02Z","rounded_local_amount":1354.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151821430},{"amount":306.38,"local_amount":6325.13,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T09:03:55Z","rounded_local_amount":6343.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159561444}],"funded_date":"2009-12-13T17:57:09Z","paid_date":"2010-08-15T09:03:55Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":157577,"name":"Los Jazmines Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La alcanc\u00eda comunal \u201cLOS JAZMI.\u201d se encuentra ubicada en la parte alta de Huayc\u00e1n distrito de Ate departamento de Lima, vienen trabajando con EDAPROSPO \u2013 Prosperidad desde hace 5 meses, la alcanc\u00eda comunal est\u00e1  conformada por 11 socios quienes desempe\u00f1an diferentes tipos de actividades como: producci\u00f3n, comercio y  servicio, la cual est\u00e1 representada por: \nM.

S. is a tough and determined widow who has the responsibility of taking care of their three children. Her eldest is 21, the middle one is 19 and the youngest is 17 years old. All her children finished only high school because she does not have the capacity to send them to college because of the expensive fares required to going in and out of the island where they live. Some of her children already have a family of their own. \r\n\r\nShe joined Ahon sa Hirap, Inc. (ASHI) a partner MFI of KIVA in the Philippines. As a member, she makes sure that her loans are invested properly and she performs her duties and responsibilities diligently. For almost five years she has been buying and selling dried fish. Aside from the fish caught by her children, she will buy fresh fish from the fishermen and dry them. She will then pack the fish in kilos and sell them to the market and to her frequent customers. She is applying for a loan of PHP 25,000 for additional capital for her dried fish business and to finance the plan of her eldest son to put up a locally known fish trap called \"skylab\" that is made up of fish net and bamboo poles positioned in the allowed fishing area of the lake. Income generated from this business will be used to renovate their house and for the daily consumption of her children and grandchildren. She is hoping that KIVA lenders will help them in this venture.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Meet Magdalena, a hard-working, very honest and warm-hearted farmer who hails from the Kericho area of Kenya, an area that has one of the best weather patterns on earth that favors farming. Magdalena is the proud mother of six lovely children that she really loves and adores and always protects. Magdalena\u2019s upbringing was very challenging and because of this she promised herself that she would work hard and get out of the poverty situation. That is why she started farming 10 years ago and through farming she has been able to earn a decent income. Magdalena is the breadwinner in her family and this really pushes her to work hard so that her six children will have a bright future and also her parents will have a comfortable life. Magdalena is seeking a loan to start horticultural farming so that she can use the excess space on her land. She dreams of buying more land and increasing her horticulture business. Accessing funds is very difficult for a woman in Kericho but through institutions such as Juhudi Kilimo and Kiva, Magdalena is optimistic that her dream will be realized and her life will completely change. Through the income from horticultural farming, Magdalena will assure her children of a bright future and she will be able to pay tuition fees for her siblings who depend on her.
