Nguy\u1ec5n Th\u1ecb (20203050113) is a 40-year-old female living in the town of Huy\u1ec7n Y\u00ean Phong in B\u1eafc Ninh province.  She is married and has 2 adult children.  To making a living, T. owns & operates a business venture raising pigs for sale.  T. has been engaged in this business for over 10 years and earns approximately 2,000,000 VND a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, T. joined SEDA to gain access to financial services to help improve  her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,152,000 VND from SEDA.  This previous loan was used to purchase baby livestock to raise & sell.\r\n\r\nT. is now requesting a new loan of 7,392,000 VND to purchase livestock feed and other supplies.  This loan will be her 2nd loan from SEDA.  She  plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to support her family.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout SEDA:\r\n\r\nThe mission of SEDA (Center of Small Enterprise Development Assistance) is to provide microfinance services to the low income and disadvantaged people in rural areas of Hanoi and the Northern provinces of Vietnam.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in Vietnamese while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\r\n\r\n\r\nT.

At this time, Ramon and Soledad are working hand in hand to meet their daily needs.\r\n\r\nRamon has been into the buying and selling of tropical fruits for quite some time now. He buys these tropical fruits such as bananas and pineapples from farmers and wholesalers of their town in bulk quantities and sells them at a piece meal rate.  He also incorporates in his stall some vegetables and spices. Monthly, he earns an estimated net income of around 11,000 PHP.\r\n\r\nTo help him continue operation of his business, he is requesting a 8,000 PHP loan.  He plans to use this loan to buy more fresh fruit from wholesalers and also vegetables and spices to replenish his current inventory.  Ramon believes an increase in his business income will result as he expands his business.\r\n\r\nRamon prays for good health and be able to enjoy life with peace and abundance.  As a CCT community partner, he faithfully attends the group's weekly fellowship* meeting where he can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God he reads.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners and clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

Four years ago she needed an income to support herself and pay for her university studies, so she decided to embark on her business adventure in the city where she lives. That is how she turned to a friend who sold her merchandise at a price. The friend made money this way, and of course Yaniris did too. Little by little she built up her own customer base, and with her earnings she accumulated some working capital that she gradually invested, and so her business has been growing.\r\n\r\nCurrently her goals to outdo her previous income are very important for her to improve her well-being everyday. This is why Yaniris is asking for a Kiva loan, the first loan she has had from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo. She will use it to buy handmade pants and sweaters.

Now, with the support of his community bank, he is thinking of opening a little clothes store in one of the main centers of the city. He is also raising money in order to improve his home.  This is his forth loan from MFP, and he likes the frequent meetings that the bank has where he can exchange experiences.

Thanks to this employment she managed to buy some useful things for her home, but with time she was saving money, and she purchased a 3-wheel delivery van (motor car) 4 months ago, which she has been managing with care. She is outstanding with the monthly maintenance and very careful with the people she rents the vehicle to, trying as much as possible to keep this particular working vehicle from deteriorating or declining in value very quickly. Martha\u2019s goal is to have a mechanic\u2019s shop where she can sell diverse varieties of spare parts, because they are very sought-after and expensive, which makes the business profitable. She has plans to partner with a nephew who studied mechanics and together open a small workshop of spare parts. This is loan number 29, and she hopes to continue working with MFP, especially with her group companions who are very committed to the possibility of improving their ability to pay back. Martha will invest 2800 to buy spare parts for her vehicle, with the objective of continually maintaining her motor car.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jo Longnecker, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":900,"image":{"id":300578,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Motorcycle Transport","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"Purchase spare parts for her motor car","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-04-10T02:50:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":900,"lender_count":32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Martha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-03-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2800,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":652.55},{"due_date":"2009-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":682.91},{"due_date":"2009-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":714.69},{"due_date":"2009-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":749.85}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":209.75},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":219.51},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":229.72},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":241.02}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":209.74,"local_amount":652.55,"processed_date":"2009-04-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:50:11Z","rounded_local_amount":659.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36012416},{"amount":219.51,"local_amount":682.91,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T01:02:28Z","rounded_local_amount":690.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44596004},{"amount":229.72,"local_amount":714.69,"processed_date":"2009-06-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:44:21Z","rounded_local_amount":722.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52990268},{"amount":241.03,"local_amount":749.85,"processed_date":"2009-07-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:45:29Z","rounded_local_amount":758.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63211392}],"funded_date":"2009-04-11T03:00:29Z","paid_date":"2009-08-15T16:45:29Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jo Longnecker","image":606476}},{"id":104559,"name":"Aziza","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Aziza has been a clothes and plates seller in the Mikunguni neighborhood of Zanzibar for three years.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She owns & operates a business venture, planting & harvesting bananas for sale.  She has 2 years of experience in this business.    Mama needs a loan of WST $1500 to purchase weed-killers such as Gramoxome.  She plans to use the profit from her business (estimated to be 40 talas or US $17 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Mama joined SPBD to gain access to financial services.  Most of SPBD's clients are unable to borrow from commercial banks, because they lack collateral.  This is Mama's 2nd loan with SPBD. \r\n\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:*               1 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         2 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              1 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD evaluates the living conditions of each of its borrowers.  Generally, a loan manager evaluates a variety of social metrics on a scale out of 3 (the higher the number, the better off the person is) and these are averaged for the \"\"overall social metric score.\"\"  For example, a 3 out of 3 on \"\"level of education\"\" would mean that the borrower has graduated from university. \"\r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem. \r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD.

With a lot of effort, America has been able to work her lands and make them very productive.  She grows potatoes and peas \u2013 products which she later brings to sell wholesale at the Tarma city market.  What she likes most about her work is caring for her crops.

Sobre Talca existe una curiosa referencia en Chile, la frase \"Talca, Par\u00eds, y Londres\". Entre los mitos al respecto, algunos dicen que es una derivaci\u00f3n de la originalmente dicha por un ingl\u00e9s \"Talca parece Londres\", por la abundante neblina que cubre frecuentemente la ciudad en la temporada invernal, a semejanza de la capital del Reino Unido.\n\n\n","en":"Susana is a member of the \"Caminando Hacia el Futuro\" (Walking Toward the Future) communal bank in the city of Talca.\r\n\r\nShe makes churrascas (a type of tortilla cooked on a grill). She also makes light meals for lunch; these are salads with beef, tuna or chicken. She has been working in food production for three years. Susana says that she makes the dough in her kitchen at home, and she sells the churrascas from a cart that she fitted with a grill and a counter. Her daily schedule is from 5:00 until 9:00 in the evening, and she has a good number of customers since she places her stand near the street. She can therefore take advantage of the pedestrian traffic, which makes it easier to make sales.\r\n\r\nShe will use the loan to buy food production supplies, including flour and charcoal. One of Susana's long-term goals is to move her business into a local shop and set up a bakery.\r\n\r\nSusana lives with her husband and their two children, who are 18 and 19 years old. Both children attend school and help their mother with her cart. The children also sell lunches at their respective schools.\r\n\r\nSusana's dream for herself is to study international cooking since she would like to perfect her work. One of her motivations to continue with the business is that it gives her a certain amount of economic independence.\r\n\r\nSusana is very happy and grateful for the support from Fondo Esperanza since it has allowed her to invest in her business. She also says that she attended all the training sessions, and because of them she also feels very motivated. The communal bank that she is part of is also very united and committed.\r\n\r\nTalca is in the Maule region, which is located in the center of the country. It is the administrative, economic and cultural center of the region, so it is the most important city in Chile's Central Valley. In Chile there is a curious reference to Talca in the phrase \"Talca, Paris and London\". Some of the stories about this saying state that it comes from a statement originally made by an Englishman, \"Talca parece Londres\" (Talca looks like London) because of the abundant cloud cover that is frequently over the city in winter, similar to the capital of the United Kingdom. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":875,"image":{"id":948215,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy supplies such as flour and charcoal for making foods.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CL","country":"Chile","town":"Talca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-30 -71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":157,"posted_date":"2011-12-18T00:30:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":875,"lender_count":31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Susana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-12-12T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"CLP","disbursal_amount":451128,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":875,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":20580},{"due_date":"2011-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":20776},{"due_date":"2012-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":20974},{"due_date":"2012-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":21175},{"due_date":"2012-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":21377},{"due_date":"2012-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":21581},{"due_date":"2012-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":21787},{"due_date":"2012-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":21995},{"due_date":"2012-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":22204},{"due_date":"2012-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":22416},{"due_date":"2012-02-27T08:00:00Z","amount":22630},{"due_date":"2012-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":22846},{"due_date":"2012-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":23064},{"due_date":"2012-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":23284},{"due_date":"2012-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":23507},{"due_date":"2012-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":23731},{"due_date":"2012-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":23957},{"due_date":"2012-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":24186},{"due_date":"2012-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":24417},{"due_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":24641}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39.92},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.29},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.68},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.07},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.47},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.86},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.25},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.66},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.07},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.48},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.89},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.31},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.74},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.16},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.59},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.03},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.47},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.91},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.36},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.79}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":80.21,"local_amount":41356,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:00:54Z","rounded_local_amount":41606.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250772365},{"amount":207.33,"local_amount":106894,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T10:14:00Z","rounded_local_amount":107541.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257180812},{"amount":173.1,"local_amount":89245,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:26:13Z","rounded_local_amount":89785.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263315270},{"amount":179.8,"local_amount":92701,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T09:21:26Z","rounded_local_amount":93262.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270031456},{"amount":234.56,"local_amount":120932,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:32:27Z","rounded_local_amount":121665.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276643645}],"funded_date":"2011-12-18T05:57:49Z","paid_date":"2012-05-15T09:32:27Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":379977,"name":"Beatriz Maricela","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Beatr\u00edz es una mujer de 21 a\u00f1os, se describe como una persona alegre, amigable, honesta, trabajador y luchadora en conseguir las cosas que se propone.

Abdusattor is married and the father of four children. He works as a farmer. Educated until secondary school, he had to leave early because he couldn't afford to attend. Bestowed with a good work ethic, he has wholeheartedly committed himself to agriculture. \r\n\r\nHe is growing vegetables: potato, onion, carrot and others. He is now seeking a loan of 4000 Somoni ($1175 USD) to buy fertilizer for his crop to be prepared for the upcoming season and to produce a good harvest at the end of the season. He can then better meet the needs of his family and improve his work conditions.\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and with it\u2019s famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

This is  Lwiza M. from Mbeya. She is 43 years old, and married  with 5 children between the ages of 15 and 25.\r\n\r\nLwiza, an orphan, has been running a genge business since 1995. A genge (grocery store) is typically a very basic structure made of wood, with a tin roof, which sells general items such as onions, tomatoes, chili, oil, rice, and dried fish. It is the kind of place local people send their children running to fetch something when they are in the middle of cooking the evening meal, and don\u2019t have time to go all the way to the market to buy the missing ingredient.\r\n\r\nLwiza works at the business for 9 to 12 hours per day, 6 days a week.  Lwiza currently earns about $80 a month from her business. She is requesting a loan of $300 in order to purchase items in bulk for her business. In the future, she plans to open a new business. \r\n\r\nLwiza thanks you for your support!\r\n\r\nABOUT SELFINA:\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania, through micro-leasing. The organization supports the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.

She is 35 years old. Marisa is married and has three school-aged children. To make a living, Marisa raises livestock. The main source of income for the business comes from raising pigs for sale. Marisa has been engaged in this business for over three years and earns approximately 5,000 Philippine pesos a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Marisa joined GDMPC, a Kiva partner, to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Marisa has successfully repaid a previous loan of 3,000 PHP from GDMPC. Marisa is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase feed for the pigs. This will be the second loan taken out by Marisa from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\n<b>About GDMPC:<\/b>\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three unit offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":125,"image":{"id":463266,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To purchase feed for the pigs","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Clarin, Plaridel Mis.

Many young people have migrated to cities and other countries in the hope that they can help their families secure a better future.\r\n\r\nOur member makes a living raising animals--chickens, pigs, cattle--that she only sells when she needs money.  She also farms her land, growing maize mostly, work that she has done diligently for forty years.  The business hasn't grown, though, because she hasn't known how to do it.\r\n\r\nAna Maria, 60, has been a widow since her husband died of a brain tumor 12 years ago.  She and her husband had ten children, eight of whom are married and independent.  The other two, who are 20 and 17 years old, work at construction jobs, helping their mother when they can.  They also study at a night school.  Ana Maria is worried about her 20 year old son who is ill with no-one knows what and they have to spend money every month to buy the medications they hope can help him.\r\n \r\nAna Maria has been a member of her community bank for eleven years.

Her goal is to spend more time on the business so that she can expand it.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jere Wiseman, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":510319,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Buy products to resell.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Cuenca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2010-03-22T22:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":775,"lender_count":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"  Ana Mar\u00eda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-02-26T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":770,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":64.17},{"due_date":"2010-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":64.17},{"due_date":"2010-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":64.17},{"due_date":"2010-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":64.17},{"due_date":"2010-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":64.17},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.17},{"due_date":"2010-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":64.17},{"due_date":"2010-06-29T07:00:00Z","amount":64.17},{"due_date":"2010-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":64.17},{"due_date":"2010-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":64.17},{"due_date":"2010-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":64.17},{"due_date":"2010-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":64.13}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.59},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.58},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.59},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.59},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.58},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.59},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.59},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.58},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.59},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.59},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.58},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.55}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":64.59,"local_amount":64.17,"processed_date":"2010-03-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:00:42Z","rounded_local_amount":64.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128946581},{"amount":78.34,"local_amount":77.83,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:18:33Z","rounded_local_amount":78.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136674801},{"amount":180,"local_amount":178.85,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:16:57Z","rounded_local_amount":180,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144708977},{"amount":193.76,"local_amount":192.51,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:46:54Z","rounded_local_amount":193.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151892273},{"amount":129.18,"local_amount":128.34,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:10:31Z","rounded_local_amount":129.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159632658},{"amount":129.13,"local_amount":128.3,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:15:12Z","rounded_local_amount":129.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166846721}],"funded_date":"2010-03-23T01:03:22Z","paid_date":"2010-09-15T10:15:12Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jere Wiseman","image":30736}},{"id":191466,"name":"Kim","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Kim S. is 48 years old and she is a villager who lives in Svay Pear village in Takeo province.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

D\u00edaz is an inhabitant of the municipality of Malambo. She owns a general store, which has been part of her plan for her life since she was very young. She started with a store owned by her mother, where she learned to appreciate independent work, and her efforts have become a basic component of her family life, her personal income and the sustenance of her household, which made up of her husband and their 4 children, ranging from 11 to 24 years old.\r\n\r\nShe began by independently selling a variety of merchandise when she got married, and she has gradually added display shelves and more products until the store became what it is today: a general store and her great legacy, which she protects with care, because it is a significant source of income for the development of her family and a model of entrepreneurship for her children. \r\n\r\nThis is her second loan with the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation, and with her Kiva loan, she will buy household products, paper goods, cosmetics and fashion items which she needs to include in her range of merchandise. When she began with the Foundation, she started with $1,000,000 COP, which she gradually increased; today she hopes to receive $1,500,000 COP. Ana says that the loans from this organization have helped her to build up a credit history and buy a public transport vehicle, which today is another source of income for her household. In addition, her enterprising spirit has led her to create a business together with her children, in the field of water purification and technical disinfection. They offer this service to various companies, and she was also able to formalize the business through the Foundation with the Chamber of Commerce. In the three years that she has dealt with the Foundation, she has seen the increase in her capital reflected in better educational conditions for her children, and with respect to the business, better infrastructure, since she now has 5 display cases. Her main customers are her neighbors in the area. Her greatest dream is that her children will be able to finish their degrees at the University, and that they will continue strengthening themselves as businesspeople, which will make them very independent. Her greatest challenge is controlling the family's expenses so that they are not excessive and end up consuming not only her earnings but also her business capital.

La tienda de Teodocia es una de las m\u00e1s visitadas en la ciudad de Tarma, desde muy temprano por la ma\u00f1ana abre su tienda en espera de que sus vecinos lleguen a comprar las cosas que necesitan. Ella es una vendedora muy alegre y atenta, ya que siempre recibe a sus clientes con una sonrisa y esta dispuesta ayudarlos en sus compras. Lo que m\u00e1s le gusta de su trabajo es conversar con sus vecinos, lleva 11 a\u00f1os en este negocio y considera que lo m\u00e1s dif\u00edcil es tener que permanecer todo el d\u00eda dentro de su tienda sin poder salir. Con el tiempo, espera poder ampliar su tienda y llenarla de m\u00e1s mercader\u00eda, para poder ofrecer a sus clientes una mejor variedad de productos. Es el noveno cr\u00e9dito con MFP y esta dispuesta a pagar todas sus cuotas a tiempo, ya que no quiere causarle problemas a su banco comunal, donde es muy querida por el resto de sus socias.

She opens her store very early in the morning and waits for her neighbors to come and buy whatever they need.  Teodocia is a very cheerful and attentive saleswoman.  She always greets her customers with a smile and is ready to help them to make their purchases.  What Teodocia most enjoys about her work is chatting with her neighbors.  She has been in this business for 11 years and she considers the most difficult part of her work to be having to remain in her store all day without being able to go out.\r\n\r\nOver time, Teodocia hopes to be able to expand her store and fill it with more merchandise, so that she can offer her customers a better range of products.  This is her ninth loan with MFP and she is ready to make her repayments on time since she doesn't want to cause trouble for her community bank where she is very well liked by the her fellow members.  Teodocia will use the 2,000 Peruvian soles she has requested to buy more products in order to better stock her store.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":739559,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

She sells mineral water so that people do not have to drink water from the faucet. And because many families typically cook their own meals at least three times a day, Nena saw the opportunity to sell liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) to meet their cooking needs. She has been in business for ten years and manages without hired employees. Every month she earns Php10, 000. Because she needs  financial help for her business, she has applied for a Php 25,000 loan. She will use this money to purchase grocery items, mineral water and stocks of LPG. She believes that increasing her inventory will lead to a more successful business. \r\n\r\nNena is determined to work hard and love what she is doing to bring the success she strives for. It is her dream to make her business prosper and expand in the future. As a CCT community partner, she faithfully attends the group's weekly fellowship* meetings where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance

one of the produce markets in Ivano-Frankivsk.  He previously worked at a brick factory, but was forced to find work at the market after the factory closed down.  Currently, Ivan sells vegetables, such as potatoes, cucumbers, tomatoes, onions and also seasonal and nonseasonal fruits, citrus fruits, and also fish in the winter.  He always offers a wide variety of fruits and vegetables at low prices, and besides, there are not many competitors with similar products at the market.  Ivan has been involved in selling products for four years.  His monthly income is 7,000 hryvnia.  Previously, this market, where Ivan works, was disastrous.  Recently, however, local government decided to legalize and beautify this market and subsequently started to build neat kiosks-booths, each one of which costing 25,000 hryvnia.  Ivan wants to invest the money, received from Kiva, into the purchase of a new retail kiosk.  He needs to pay his first installment for the kiosk soon.  Ivan plans to work in the new kiosk, and his wife would work in the old kiosk, which will be relocated elsewhere.  As a result of this expansion, Ivan hopes that his sales will increase by 1.5-2 times.  In the future, Ivan wants to purchase a car, which is becoming more and more necessary for running the business."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1875,"image":{"id":912731,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

is married and has two grown daughters. After graduating from a college of commerce, she started working as a market vendor. Today she runs her own business selling scarves and swimwear in the central city market. Presently, Tatyana has about $1,000 of working capital. Her monthly profit amounts to $150-200. \r\n\r\nTatyana has been in this trade for five years now. There are very few other businesses selling similar items in the market where Tatyana has her kiosk. Because of this, customer demand continues to grow all the time. Tatyana has established a reputation as an entrepreneur of integrity. She has repaid every loan she has received from \u201cNadiya Ukraine\u201d without any defaults.     \r\n\r\nTatyana is requesting a loan for $800 to re-stock her inventory before the spring\/summer season. She is planning to purchase bright silk, chiffon and satin scarves, soft shawls and one and two piece swimsuits. Compelling prices and a wide range of fashion choices to suit every taste and lifestyle will attract many new clients to Tatyana\u2019s business. An increase in sales will help her generate more profit and pay for her daughter\u2019s college tuition. \r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n\u0422\u0435\u0442\u044f\u043d\u0430 \u2013

Every morning she bikes around 20-30km away from home to nearby villages to collect recycles.  She then sells it to the recycling company, earning 3-4USD a day.  The change in income is not a whole lot, but at least it's stable.  This year Mrs. H. decided to open a small breakfast restaurant.  The job is rather difficult, but the good thing is that she will not to go too far every morning like before, which is better for her age.  Furthermore, her two kids can also help out in their free time.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<P>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<P>\r\nIMON's History\r\n<P>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C.

Maryjane has successfully repaid a previous loan of 8000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional products to sell. Maryjane is requesting a new loan of 11000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional inventory & working capital. This loan will be the 3rd loan taken out by Maryjane from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand the business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Vilma M., one of CCT's community partners, not only sets high expectations but also takes concrete steps to achieve them. Vilma, 48, graduated from college and is married to Diomedes, a Philippine National Police (PNP) officer. Together they have four children, one of whom does not yet attend school. The three others are already studying.  The family lives in Pasay City, Philippines.\r\n\r\nVilma runs both a carinderia (street-side food stall) and a sari-sari (variety) store. She caters to the physical needs of her neighbors with cooked meals and retail items like soap, shampoo, and seasonings, among others. Every day, Vilma earns around PHP350 with these two small-scale enterprises.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operating her businesses, Vilma would like to apply for a PHP17,000 loan. She will use the money to keep her carinderia in good shape and to replenish the stocks in her sari-sari store. Vilma envisions transforming the small store into a big grocery. Vilma also wants to raise chickens and pigs for additional income.\r\n\r\nVilma does not highlight her trials but keep focusing on her expected outcomes. Ultimately, she wants to see her family's home renovated and her children graduating from college.\r\n\r\nAll CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":652642,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

She and her husband have two children who are 17 and 22. They currently attend school.\r\n\r\nShe runs a retail business in Kwa Zulu Natal of Emandini in South Africa and sells live chickens and cold drinks at her home. She explains that she has been in this business for three years.

This is why she has become the main source of support in her house, and she had to postpone her dream of becoming a great professional for awhile.  Her wish is to have a career after finishing her secondary studies, and this is what drove her to work in a shop that manufactures sweaters, where she offers her sewing services.  She works every day from very early to very late and is one of the most outstanding workers in the shop.  Nancy is very happy because this work that she does lets her save to be able to start studying at the university in her beautiful city.  Nancy hopes to continue supporting her parents and to support her studies, and this is why she is requesting a loan of $200 to invest in a small sewing shop in her parents' home.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback micro-finance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are deemed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":319946,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Secretarial

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

En la actualidad solicita un cr\u00e9dito  $ 1.500.000  el cual ser\u00e1 invertido en la compra de hilaza para hamacas, hilo fino para bolsos y lana para elaborar mochilas y comprar mercanc\u00eda como ropa, cosm\u00e9ticos y calzado que adicionar\u00e1 a su negocio. \nLa mayor parte de la ni\u00f1ez de Olga la vivi\u00f3 en un corregimiento de San Jacinto Bol\u00edvar llamado Bajo Grande hasta sus 10 a\u00f1os, de donde fu\u00e8 desplazada y huy\u00e9ndole al conflicto armado que ocurri\u00f3 en ese momento, se vino a vivir a San Jacinto, pero hoy todo eso es parte de su historia. La se\u00f1ora Olga ha recibido dos cr\u00e9ditos con la fundaci\u00f3n, los cuales ha pagado muy bien. Su negocio ha servido de mucho a su familia, debido a que los ingresos de su esposo no son muy altos y ella siempre ayuda con los gastos del hogar.

Gracias a Dios est\u00e1n superando esta situaciones y espera un futuro m\u00e1s promisorio para ella y su familia. \n\n","en":"Olga Isabel P. A. is a 26-year-old woman with a 6-year-old son. They live in San Jacinto, in the department of Bol\u00edvar, where she has been making handicrafts, such as hammocks, backpacks and bolis (frozen juice pops) for the last 4 years.  She is currently requesting a $1,500,000 COP, which will be invested in purchasing hammock cord, fine thread to make handbags, and wool to make backpacks. She will also buy such merchandise as apparel, cosmetics and footwear to expand her business. <p>\r\nOlga spent a large part of her childhood living in a small town in San Jacinto Bol\u00edvar called Bajo Grande, until she was 10 years old and was displaced while fleeing from the armed conflict at that time. She then came to live in San Jacinto, but this is all a part of her history. Ms. Olga has obtained two loans, which she has already repaid, from this institute. Her business has been very beneficial to her family because her husband's income is insufficient and she always helps with the household expenses. Olga dreams of obtaining her own house, expanding her business, and in so doing increasing the family income. Her greatest challenge was having to leave her town in order to save her life because she had to withstand difficult moments and financial hardships. She and her husband now live in apart for job reasons. Thank God that they are now overcoming these difficulties, and she now hopes for a more promising future for both her and her family.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Elizabeth

in San Jose, California. Before opening her own business, Monica spent five years working for a watch salesman at the market and refining her own sales skills. However, she worked long and difficult hours and did not retain control over the profits she made. In 2001, Monica decided it was finally time to become her own boss. Getting started was difficult, she said, especially figuring out things like permits, but she is glad she did. \r\n\r\nMonica\u2019s stall is now open for business Thursday to Sunday every week, and she has one employee who helps her on the busier weekend days. A $3,500 loan from Opportunity Fund will allow her to increase her inventory and consequently boost sales. To help manage the growth, Monica\u2019s husband, Paul, will begin working at the stall with her. Until recently, Paul made a living selling paintings. He explains that the market for artwork has suffered recently. The couple is excited to have the opportunity now to work together at Monica's stall. \r\n\r\n\"I already have the satisfaction of working for myself, but I hope my business grows more,\" said Monica when asked about her goals for the future. She is proud of her success and that it enables her to send money to Mexico to help her parents and to support her sister's education. While she has a few cousins in the United States, the rest of her family lives in the state of Oaxaca in Mexico.\r\n\r\nMonica first learned about Opportunity Fund from a brochure that a cousin gave her. Her experience has been very positive and she hopes to get a slightly larger loan in the future. \"I am very grateful to Opportunity Fund,\" says Monica, \"because I'm going to keep moving forward with my business.\"\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3500,"image":{"id":562744,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To

She owns a business venture planting and harvesting taro for sale.  Suemalo has 4 years of experience in this business.  Suemalo needs a loan of WST$2900 to purchase weed-killers such as Gramoxome.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 550 talas or US $229 per week) to financially support immediate members of her family.\r\n\r\nIn 2006, Suemalo joined SPBD.  This is her 6th loan with SPBD.  SPBD's loans are Suemalo's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.

Sherzod is grateful to everyone supporting him.    \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.
