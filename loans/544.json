While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from raising pigs for breeding. Marjory has been engaged in her business for over 8 years and earns approximately 3500 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Marjory joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Marjory has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase breeding livestock. Marjory is requesting a new loan of 12,000 PHP which will be used to purchase livestock feed & other supplies. This will be the 3rd loan taken out by Marjory from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines.

She is 25 years-old. Daylyn is unmarried and has one infant-aged child. To make a living, Daylyn owns and operates a sari-sari (variety) retail shop. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from buying and selling daily use products such as shampoo, soap, canned goods, junk food, breads, biscuits and sanitary napkins in the local community. Daylyn has been engaged in her business for over two years and earns approximately 9,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Daylyn joined Kiva partner HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Daylyn has successfully repaid a previous loan of 14,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional inventory and to provide working capital. Daylyn is requesting a new loan of 14,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell such as canned goods and junk foods. This loan will be the fifth loan taken out by Daylyn from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, we created this template for our field staff to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate

She has been doing this work for 15 years and her income is important because it helps support her household.\r\n\r\nM\u00e9lida has two businesses. On one side, she sells crafts that she makes herself. On the other, she sells beauty products and general merchandise. Her goal in the future is to have a storefront where she can exhibit her crafts, and she thinks about developing it into a specialized store for artisan crafts.\r\n\r\nM\u00e9lida is a woman who has learned how to observe what the market needs and what she can do to respond to it in order to increase her earnings. This is why she also sells beauty products and small home appliances on request, and she sells them on credit. M\u00e9lida is taking out her first loan with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo because she needs to increase her working capital in order to respond opportunely to her customers. She plans to use her \"credikiva\" to buy cosmetics, microwave ovens, blenders, and other items that she has orders for or that move quickly among her best customers. She will make her money back quickly and it will be a successful investment.\r\n\r\nM\u00e9lida puts in great effort in order to achieve her dream.

She is separated from her husband and lives with her 14-year-old daughter who she loves dearly and wants to provide a better quality of life.  Aurelia lives in her own home.  She sells fast food and fried snacks, such as roasted chicken and \u201csalchipapas\u201d (sausages and fried potatoes), from a small space inside of her home.  Her business is named \u201cLas Dos Hermanitas\u201d (The Two Little Sisters) and is well-known in the area.  Aurelia has been serving her customers for four years.  In her business, her daughter and another employee help with attending to the customers.  She enjoys cooking and working because it keeps her occupied.  Aurelia started working out of financial necessity since she receives no income from her ex-husband.  Now she wants to grow her business a little more so that she can generate the necessary income to pay for the household expenses and her daughter\u2019s education.  She wants this very much, so she is motivated to continue striving and moving forward.  Aurelia considers her business to be profitable because she has regular customers that she has gained as a result of her good service and charming personality.  She has plans to grow her business by adding the sale of barbecued chickens.  \r\n<p>\r\nThis will be her fifth loan with the MFP organization.  Aurelia is grateful for the financial support she has received so that she can advance her business.  She wants to continue receiving this support, so she promises to continue the completion of her payments just as she did with her previous loans.  Aurelia is pleased to be part of her Communal Bank group because she considers the members to be supportive and responsible individuals.  The amount she requested will be invested in the purchase of an oven that costs 2500 PEN so that she can begin selling barbecued chickens.  The rest of the loan will be invested in ingredients for preparing roasted chickens.       \r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1125,"image":{"id":920538,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Restaurant","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to purchase an oven and ingredients for preparing roasted chickens.

This is Tuaoi's 2nd loan with SPBD. \r\n\r\n*SPBD evaluates the living conditions of each of its borrowers.  Generally, a loan manager evaluates a variety of social metrics on a scale out of 3 (the higher the number, the better off the person is) and these are averaged for the \"overall social metric score.\"  For example, a 3 out of 3 on \"level of education\" would mean that the borrower has graduated from university.  \r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.

is a very industrious, multifaceted, and enterprising woman, who has always sought a way to provide to her family with the necessary things that they need to develop fully.  Therefore, since she was very young, she has been selling different articles of clothing.   She is a very responsible and dedicated mother to her 5 children.  On the weekends, with the aid of her older daughter and her husband she sells chicken soup, from her in-laws\u2019 house.  During the week, she is dedicated her clothing sales (and when the opportunity arises, footwear sales) in a small rented space near her house.  For a year, Leonor has sold food and also other articles of clothing locally.  Before she was trying to sell groceries, but found that it produced low profits.  Leonor has dreamt of owning a car and has now decided to invest her savings to buy a car, so she can have transportation.  However, this dream is in the distant future (as she cannot afford it yet), therefore, she will continue to work for the benefit and welfare of her beloved family.  She needs a loan to increase the quantity and variety of articles of clothing that she offers in order to increase her profits and eventually reach her dream. \r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Spanish by Jenny Dean, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n<p>\r\nLeonor, es una mujer emprendedora, multifac\u00e9tica y muy hacendosa, siempre ha buscado la manera de proveer a su familia lo necesario para que se desarrollen plenamente, por esa raz\u00f3n su vida siempre ha estado ligada, desde muy joven, al comercio de diferentes art\u00edculos que han albergado una experiencia positiva en el mundo de las ventas; ahora ya es una madre de familia muy responsable y dedicada a sus 5 hijos. Los fines de semana vende caldo de gallina, de cabeza y mondongo en la casa de sus suegros con la ayuda de su hija mayor y su esposo, los d\u00edas en los que no desarrolla esta actividad se dedica a la venta de prendas de vestir en un peque\u00f1o espacio que alquil\u00f3 muy cerca de su casa y en oportunidades aprovecha las temporadas para vender calzados.

His workshop is located in the big open-air market of Sikasso and most of his clientele is composed of men and especially of itinerant merchants.

Besides tailoring, he buys sewing machines in Lom\u00e9 (Republic of Togo) to re-sell them to the tailors of Sikasso.<P>\r\n\r\nWith the desire to satisfy his ever-growing orders for sewing machines more fully, he came to the micro-finance institution Soro Yiriwaso, and he is on his first individual loan which will permit him to buy 10 sewing machines. \r\n        \r\nWith this loan, he expects to make a monthly profit of 200,000 F CFA which will allow him to cover most of his personal expenses, contribute to family expenses, pay the interest on his loan, and invest any remainder into his

His wife is a housekeeper. Hoshim owns a 0.5-hectare field for cultivating onions and tomatoes in order to earn a living. On this plantation, Hoshim now cannot do any planting because he does not have enough money for seeds and fertilizer. In order to deal with this problem, he decided to ask for a loan of $800 USD to buy the necessary substances. Hoshim counts on this opportunity to obtain a better yield, in order to improve the living conditions of his family.    <p>\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International<p>\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes being a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.<p>\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.<p>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<p>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Manab\u00ed province on the cost of Ecuador.  This city is known for its great artisans who make furniture by hand and Panama hats as well as the finest details in tagua (a nut).\r\n\r\nWhen we visited the communal bank \"Al Progreso\" we spoke with Se\u00f1ora Esmeraldas.  She is 41-years-old, married, and has been with the bank for 37 cycles. She buys and sells shell fish for a living.  To stock her business, she has to travel to the port in Manta which is twenty minutes from the city of her birth.  She and her husband have learned how to keep the business going.  He is in charge of buying in the catfish early in the mornings, two times a week. And now and again, when has more orders, and the fish is cheaper, he has to make some sales and travels to the Quito to supply his customers.  Mrs. Esmeralda tells us that during Easter week it's hard to get a good price on fish; it's when it's most expensive and isn't worth it because they don't make a profit. \r\n\r\nOur member, Esmeralda, will invest this entire loan in fish.  She is sure that she will sell all of it even if she doesn't make much.  The most important thing is to not let the business go. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Shelly Hubman, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":900,"image":{"id":519797,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish Selling","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To buy fish.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Portoviejo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2010-04-05T19:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":900,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Esmeraldas Yasmin","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":880,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2010-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2010-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2010-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2010-06-29T07:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2010-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2010-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":110}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":110,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:18:47Z","rounded_local_amount":112.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136674837},{"amount":225,"local_amount":220,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:16:59Z","rounded_local_amount":225,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144709020},{"amount":337.5,"local_amount":330,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:47:04Z","rounded_local_amount":337.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151892318},{"amount":225,"local_amount":220,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:10:26Z","rounded_local_amount":225,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159632689}],"funded_date":"2010-04-06T19:17:07Z","paid_date":"2010-08-15T11:10:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Shelly Hubman","image":226625}},{"id":195223,"name":"Thav","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Thav T., 38, is married and resides with her husband and three children in Sa ang District, Cambodia, an area known for sugarcane plantations.

With this loan, Aminata will increase the amount of cottons she buys to 25 bales. Her aim now is to buy these cottons from Bamoi at a cheaper rate, and then supply her colleagues here in Makeni.

For the past 5 years she has embroidered beautiful designs on wool sweaters, work which she is able to conduct in the peace and quiet of her own home, which provides her with an environment where she can be creative in producing these designs that seem to come to life on each sweater she completes.\r\nA friend taught her the art of emboidery and since then she has worked at it non-stop.  Juneth receives a  large number of orders and she must complete the items in two weeks.  She considers this a profitable business since her main tools are her own hard-working hands, needles, wool, and all of her imagination.  She has taught her daughter Edilma to embroider so she will continue with her mother's artistic legacy.

Gradually, he acquired more inventory and customers who now place large orders with him.\r\n\r\nThis loan will be used to buy larger amounts of product because he wants to have a wider variety of stock available in an effort to sell more.\r\n\r\nHe continues to dream with becoming a wholesale veterinary products distributor.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":501510,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Health","sector":"Health","themes":null,"use":"To buy veterinary medicines.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Leon","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.435556 -86.879444","type":"point"}},"partner_id":96,"posted_date":"2010-03-05T18:30:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":725,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"William De Los Reyes ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-02-18T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":15000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2010-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2010-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2010-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2010-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2010-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2010-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2010-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2010-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2010-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2011-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2011-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":1250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.42},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.41},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.42},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.42},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.41},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.42},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.42},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.41},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.42},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.42},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.41},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.42}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":60.42,"local_amount":1250,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-06T07:51:19Z","rounded_local_amount":1259.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":130493628},{"amount":1.34,"local_amount":27.8,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:20:20Z","rounded_local_amount":28.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136676455},{"amount":122.86,"local_amount":2542.01,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:18:30Z","rounded_local_amount":2561.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144710875},{"amount":60.75,"local_amount":1256.86,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-16T07:39:38Z","rounded_local_amount":1266.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":152046134},{"amount":63.36,"local_amount":1310.81,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-16T08:44:27Z","rounded_local_amount":1320.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159761344},{"amount":58.21,"local_amount":1204.34,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:16:48Z","rounded_local_amount":1213.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166848304},{"amount":61.6,"local_amount":1274.51,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-16T08:49:09Z","rounded_local_amount":1284.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172256269},{"amount":61.9,"local_amount":1280.73,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-18T11:08:43Z","rounded_local_amount":1290.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177802290},{"amount":234.56,"local_amount":4852.94,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-17T10:59:40Z","rounded_local_amount":4890.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182956150}],"funded_date":"2010-03-06T15:53:37Z","paid_date":"2010-12-17T10:59:40Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":187045,"name":"Tupuai","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Tupuai  F. is 29 and single with no children.  She owns a business venture, selling both food & daily use products in the local community.  Tupuai  has 5 years of experience in this business.  Tupuai  needs a loan of WST $1000 to purchase additional products to sell.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 400 talas or US $167 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Tupuai  joined SPBD.    This is her 1st loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Tupuai 's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Tupuai  F. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.87 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              2 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         2 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

She is 32 years old. Carmela is the group leader of a 4-member group loan offered by GDMPC. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nCarmela is single. To make a living, Carmela owns & operates a business venture in the retail sector operating a specialized retail store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling ready to wear clothing (RTW)  like short pants, blouses and other items in the local community. Carmela has been engaged in her business for over 3 years and earns approximately 5000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Carmela joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Carmela has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5000 PHP from GDMPC. Carmela is requesting a new loan of 10000 PHP which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This loan will be the second loan taken out by Carmela from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three units offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She earns her living by operating 2 businesses: a butcher shop and a mini-pharmacy. Her husband, Jerry, 45 years old, earns his living as a vendor. This couple has 3 children who are between 12 and 23 years old. \r\n\r\n<p>Diana joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2004 because she hoped for something better for her family. With the help of her past 13 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon and through her own efforts, Diana has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty. Her previous loan of PHP 20,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 20,000, raising the family's standard of living. This time, for her 14th loan, she is borrowing PHP 15,000, which she intends to use to buy various meats, sausages and chicken so that she can continue to save up for the future and for her children's education. Diana is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\n<p>About NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Her husband Roel, who is 37 years old, works as a motorcycle driver to earn his living and helps in his wife's business activities.  They have five children who are between 7 and 11 years old. Marites joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2009 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past four loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Marites has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 9,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 11,400 uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her fifth loan, she is borrowing PHP 15,000 to buy livestock supplies so that she can continue to save up for the future education of her children and house renovation. Marites is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The most common livelihood of people in their Barangay is agriculture. Some are into rice planting businesses while others have livestock raising businesses.\r\n\r\nWith Vanjie\u2019s previous loan requested through ASHI, she has been able to start raising cattle and supporting her rice planting business. These are raised just in her wide backyard where the land is covered with green grass and surrounded with rice plants. Once her cattle have been given a period of time to grow, they will be sold and the profit will be as much as double the capital (the same as the rice).\r\n\r\nHowever, incomes in these kinds of businesses are seasonal, as well as the income of her husband, who is a farmer also. That is why Luzviminda thought of the need to have more savings so that she can provide her family with their daily needs. \r\n\r\nThrough ASHI and its partnership with Kiva, Luzviminda would like to request a much larger loan amount to grow her business and to be able to have more profits as well as savings. For her business to be the greatest provider of money for her family, she needs to invest more capital in it.  She hoped that her savings would someday be enough to support the education of her three children, whose ages range from 10 to 19 years old.\r\n\r\nHer eldest child, who no longer goes to school, is working as a cook in one of the fast food restaurants in town.

Minerva needs a loan of WST $1000 to purchase additional products to sell.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 300 talas or US $125 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Minerva joined SPBD.  This is her 2nd loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Minerva's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Minerva Teriki P. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.4 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.3 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.3 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              1.3 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

Kakamega is the region in Kenya known for production of sugar cane and it is well-known as the sugar-belt region. She sells vegetables, e.g. kale, onions, green vegetables and others, to the local people. She has been doing this business for seven years now and has one employee. \r\n\r\nShe says that this business is profitable and the major challenge she has is that there are so many other people in the area doing the same kind of business as hers, so customers are not loyal as they are spoiled for choice. However, she works very hard to keep her business doing well. She is using her loan of 30,000 Kenyan shillings to buy more vegetables to expand her business and meet customer demand. She hopes to grow her business to a wholesale one and, in the future, diversify into clothes sales.

She plans to use the profit from her business (estimated to be $300WST or US$125 per week) to make improvements to her house.\n\nTalaileva joined SPBD to gain access to financial services. Most of SPBD's clients are unable to borrow from commercial banks, because they lack collateral. This is Talaileva's 5th loan with SPBD.\n\n\n\n\n*SPBD evaluates the living conditions of each of its borrowers. Generally, a loan manager evaluates a variety of social metrics on a scale out of 3 (the higher the number, the better off the person is) and these are averaged for the \"overall social metric score\". For example, a 3 out of 3 on \"level of education\" would mean that the borrower has graduated from university.  \n\nAbout SPBD \nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.

Not only because of economic needs, but also her responsibility to support the future of his child who just started first grade of high school.  Ni Wayan Suatri realized that her husband's farming income could not support all her family's need anymore.  So she wants to help her husband in bringing in extra income by starting a small pig farm in her home.  Despite only using simple pig pen, she could farm several fattening pigs to be later slaughtered.  From this small business profit, Ni Wayan Suatri realized significant benefit to her family's finances.  Each fattening pig, farmed for 6 months, she could earn $66 profit, and it could help pay her child's tuition and save the rest for her old days.  DINARI loans was used to buy more pigs and quality feeds so her product can satisfy customer and increase her profit.\r\n\r\n<p><b>Translated from Indonesian by Kresna Hartandi, Kiva Volunteer <\/p><\/b>\r\n\r\nDalam usia yang tidak bisa dibilang muda lagi yaitu 42 tahun tidak membuat Ni Wayan Suatri menjadi malas dalam bekerja. Itu bukan saja karena tuntutan hidup, tetapi juga karena rasa tanggung jawabnya atas masa depan seorang anaknya yang masih harus ditanggungnya terutama dalam hal pendidikannya yang baru menginjak tahun pertama Sekolah menengah atas. Ni Wayan Suatri melihat bahwa penghasilan suaminya yang hanya seorang petani dengan penghasilan yang pas-pasan sudah tidak bisa lagi mencukupi keperluan keluarganya, sehingga timbul niatnya untuk membantu suaminya dalam memenuhi kebutuhan rumah tangganya yaitu dengan memelihara ternak babi di rumahnya. Walaupun kandangnya sederhana tapi itu dirasanya sudah cukup untuk bisa memelihara beberapa ekor babi khususnya babi penggemukan.\r\nDari usaha yang digelutinya ini Ni Wayan Suatri merasakan manfaat yang luar biasa terhadap kesejahteraan keluarganya, karena selain memiliki kesibukan setiap harinya, usahanya ini juga bisa memberikan keuntungan walaupun jumlahnya tidak begitu besar. Dari satu ekor babi penggemukan yang dipelihara selama enam bulan bisa menghasilkan keuntungan sekitar  Rp 600.000,- dan itu bisa dipergunakannya untuk membiayai sekolah anaknya dan sebagian kecil disimpannya untuk tabungan di hari tuanya kelak. Pinjaman  yang diperolehnya dari DINARI dipergunakannya untuk menambah jumlah babi penggemukan dan juga pengadaan pakan yang berkualitas supaya hasilnya bisa memuaskan dan meningkatkan keuntungannya."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":123584,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Purchase

Many clients appreciate how responsibly he takes his work:  both in the treatment of their suits and other clothing and the promptness of service.  After eight years in business, he now wants to refurbish his establishment.  For this reason, he approached WAGES to obtain a loan that would allow him to purchase a door with a window, to build a storage area, and acquire an additional clothes dryer and assorted other needed accessories.

Despite the hardships and difficulties of their life, they have strong faith and determination to improve their standard of living through patience and hard work.\r\n<p>\r\nAs a way of earning income, her husband works as a caretaker in Jacintas Hotel and Resort while Jonelyn has a business buying and selling vegetables in their village. She buys vegetables from farmers and sells them at Solano Public Market and also house to house in their village. Her monthly income is 4,500 Philippine pesos (PHP) which they use for their daily needs and for the schooling of their children.

L. is 48 and married with 5 children.  She owns a business venture, planting & harvesting fruits & vegetables for sale.  Tumama has 3 years of experience in this business.  Tumama needs a loan of WST $1500 to purchase additional seeds, seedlings & young crops to raise.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 200 talas or US $83 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Tumama joined SPBD.  This is her 2nd loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Tumama's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Tumama L. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.6 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.8 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2.3 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

She lives in the Autopista sector of the Turi parish, which means 'brother' in Quechua. This place is located on a steep hill, where one can enjoy a spectacular view of the city in the afternoon and at night and appreciate the natural beauty of the mountain range that surrounds it. \r\n\r\nOur member is 56 years old and is married with 8 children (31, 30, 29, 27, 24, 22 and 16 years old). 5 of her children are married and live independently. The children who are 27 and 24 are single and worked in a shoe factory and help with the household costs, and her youngest daughter studies in a college in the region. Blanca's husband is a carpenter and she works raising and selling guinea pigs and chickens in her community, giving additional income to cover the necessities of their home, and also for consumption in their home. Thanks to the sacrifices of their mutual work they have been able to have their own home.  \r\n\r\nBlanca has been working with loans from Fundaci\u00f3n for 2 loan cycles, thanks to the invitation from her mother-in-law to become part of this group of empresarial woman, in search of improving her family and personal situation. With the new loan she will purchase guinea pigs to breed and feed to increase her breeding place. Her dream is that sales go well.

","en":"Aizada is 30 years old and married. She and her husband are raising three children, the youngest of whom is four years old. After having graduated from  college with a degree in philology, Aizada started working in the Zhan-Bulak village school, where she still works as an English teacher. In 2003, in the search of an additional source of income for her family, Aizada started raising farm animals. She had 15,000 KGS as her starting capital. At present her farm brings in about 15,000 KGS monthly from sale of milk products. Currently she has four dairy cows, 20 sheep, eight goats and four horses. In order to increase her cattle herd, Aizada turned to  \"Bai Tushum &Partners\" for a loan of 45,000 KGS to buy two young bulls. Aizada plans to use the resulting revenues to purchase additional animals, which will allow her to expand her farm.

The organization is devoted to the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through microfinance as a practical way to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets; thus, they are deemed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and hence poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":255681,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Timber Sales","sector":"Construction","themes":null,"use":"To purchase timber in bulk","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbeya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.9 33.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-01-18T02:20:11Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Neema N.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Since he was very young, Daler learned a great deal about sambusa preparation from his mother and that's why he decided to dedicate himself to this work.\r\n\r\nDaler has big plans and dreams to grow his business. His goal is to have his own place where he can offer more comforts to his customers. And he'd like to buy a refrigerator so he can begin to offer cold drinks as well.\r\n\r\nWith this purpose in mind, Daler wants to take a loan of 1,500 USD to purchase the necessary ingredients for preparing sambusa and also to improve his business conditions. He is very motivated to grow his business and increase his income. With his efforts and your important contribution, Daler can reach his goals.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>More about Tajikistan and IMON International<\/b>\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

Occidental. She earns her living through her photography business.\r\n\r\nRosemarie\u2019s husband, Jemmy, who is 44 years old, helps in running the business by going to different schools and by catering different occasions where video or photography is needed.  They have four children between the ages of 6  and 17 years old. The children are currently going to school and also help their parents in the business as part of their daily chores.\r\n\r\nRosemarie joined the Kiva field partner, NWTF-Project Dungganon, in 2002 in the hope that she would be able to help her husband improve the quality of life of their family. With the help of her loans from NWTF-PD, she has been able to increase their family income by engaging in the photography business. Now she earns an average monthly income of $203 from her business activities.\r\n\r\nShe is a member of good standing. Her previous loan of 19,000 PHP was used to fund operations for her photography business, which had a positive impact on both the business and the family\u2019s living conditions. Now in her 14th loan cycle, Rosemarie is borrowing 20,000 PHP, which she intends to use for their photography business.  She is working hard to achieve her dreams and aspirations for her family, which are to provide them with a brighter future and a more comfortable life.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress out of earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":484406,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Photography","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"Additional

He is 53 years old. Alejandro is married and has 6 adult-aged children. To make a living, Alejandro owns and operates a specialized retail store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from buying and selling different kinds of fruits in the local community. Alejandro has been engaged in his business for over 10 years and earns approximately 6,500 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Alejandro joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Alejandro has successfully repaid a previous loan of 8,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional products to sell. Alejandro is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional inventory and provide working capital. This loan will be the 3rd loan taken out by Alejandro from HSPFI. He plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand his business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines.

Under this a fire is lit, in one corner of the courtyard outside the house, for at least two or three days.  The fish must be tended to throughout the process.  The smoked fish is then sold door to door and in the markets in Konodimini and Konobougou for cash and on credit, generally to women.\r\n\r\nMadame Azara Sogor\u00e9 hopes to earn with this loan an average monthly profit of 30,000 FCFA to be used to meet the daily needs of her household, as well as to reinvest in her business.
