A\u00f1os atr\u00e1s trabajaba en una y otra actividad que se le presentaba seg\u00fan la ocasi\u00f3n, pero desde que se comprometi\u00f3 se dedicaba a su casa, y hace 2 meses ha empezado en vender picarones (postre a base de harina de camote, en forma de donuts y se sirve con miel); prest\u00e1ndose la cocina de su suegra, por el momento prepara solo los fines de semana y el resto de d\u00edas cocina chicharrones (pedazos de carne de cerdo frito) en porciones de 1 y 1.50 soles.

Mientras tanto ha visto por conveniente dedicarse de lleno al negocio de la comida, no le es tan rentable vender solo los fines de semana, entonces ha pensado hacerlo diariamente, vender desde las 6.00pm hasta 11.00pm en la puerta de su casa.  Helen espera tener mucha suerte para captar clientela r\u00e1pidamente. Helen se incorpora a este banco comunal que ya est\u00e1 en su quinto pr\u00e9stamo, para ella ser\u00e1 el primero, pero se compromete a realizar todos su pagos correspondiente, con las esperanzas de que le sigan apoyando con futuros prestamos. El dinero que est\u00e1 solicitando es para la compra de una cocina y cacerola especial para fre\u00edr los riqu\u00edsimos picarones, y el resto de dinero ser\u00e1 para adquirir los insumos e ingredientes necesarios, tanto para los picarones, como para los chicharrones.","en":"Helen is 30 years old, lives with her partner, has 4 children, and currently lives with her in-laws. A few years ago she worked here and there wherever the opportunity arose, but since she became engaged, she has been a housewife. Two months ago she started selling donuts using her mother-in-law's stove to cook them; currently she only cooks during week-ends, the rest of the week only making pork rinds, which she sells for 1.00 to 1.50 soles. Helen's husband (partner) is a farmer, and they have just started planting citric fruits, but they have to wait about 4 or 5 more years to harvest the fruit. Meanwhile, she has seen it fit to dedicate herself completely to the food business, but realizes that it is not lucrative to sell only during week-ends, so she has decided to do it daily at her doorstep between the hours of 6 and 11 PM . Helen hopes to have good fortune in capturing clientele quickly. She has joined this community bank which is in its fifth loan cycle, the first for her, and she vows to make payments on time in hopes to continue to qualify for future loans.

Suvonkul is requesting a loan of $800 USD to enable him purchase a second dairy cow.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <p> \r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <p>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Celia and her husband Simon are a very hard-working couple that live well and planned to buy a car in addition to the one they have. They sought a loan from another financial institution for an amount of US $600.

Jeanne is a Burundian aged 48. She lives in the Cibitoke neighborhood (Bujumbura-City center).  She is married to a carpenter and is herself a tailor She prefers this trade which allows her to work with her hands and on a sewing machine over an white-collar job. In 2002, she opened her own workshop that she calls \"Maman Anitha's Sewing Workshop\"--named after her first child. \r\n\r\nJeanne is the mother of 7 children, three boys and four girls. Only one of them did not attend school. All the others are enrolled in school and one is studying law at the university. At the beginning of the socio-political crisis in Burundi (1994), the whole family took refuge in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Coming back in 2000, Jeanne continued to work as a tailor with 12 years' experience. \r\n\r\nWith the Kiva loan, she intends to add to her capital and grow her business, buying shoes, lengths of African print cloth, and fabric coming from Uganda to sell in Burundi. After that, she already has plans to open a shop of her own in the central market of Bujumbura. Since her husband is presently out of work, Jeanne is the sole breadwinner for the family, paying school fees as well as the rent for the living quarters for their son who is studying at the university, and of course their food. \r\n\r\nJeanne is very grateful for the Turame initiative which aims to reduce poverty and support small businesspeople. She is part of the Tuzinduke group, a word that means in Kirundi \"Let's Rise and Shine\". Its members are on their second loan with Turame. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Teresa Kramer, Kiva

The group is made out of 14\u00a0women, all from the same village. They are all married and mother to at least three children each. Their proximity encourages goodwill and cohesion within the group. The area where the village bank is located is very favorable to commerce thanks to the weekly markets, which facilitate the women's business such as the fattening of cattle and\/or sheep, small-scale commerce, the production and sale of peanut oil, the sale of fresh fish, etc. Given this, most of the village's women devote their time to lucrative activities. The new loan would allow them to increase their self-financing level and expand their commerce and fattening activities.\r\n\r\nMrs Mboss\u00e9 N., standing at the far right of the photo with a yellow scard in hand, is 68-year-old and a mother of 6.

Ho\u00e0ng Th\u1ecb (20209010007) is a 40 year-old female living in the town of huy\u1ec7n Y\u00ean Phong - t\u1ec9nh B\u1eafc Ninh.  She is married and has 2 school-aged children.  To make a living, M. owns & operates a business venture in the retail sector running a general store.  The main source of income for the business comes from selling a variety of different products in the local community.  M. has been engaged in this business for over 18 years and earns approximately 3.000.000 VND a month from these activities.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 2008, M. joined SEDA to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  M. has successfully repaid a previous loan of 6.048.000 VND from SEDA.  This previous loan was used to invest in expanding the business.  M. is now requesting a new loan of 8.288.000 VND which will be used to purchase additional products to sell.  The loan will be the 4th loan taken out by her from SEDA.  M. plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout SEDA:\r\n\r\nThe mission of SEDA (Center of Small Enterprise Development Assistance) is to provide microfinance services to the low income and disadvantaged people in rural areas of Hanoi and the Northern provinces of Vietnam.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in Vietnamese while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\r\n\r\n----------------------------------\r\n\r\nM.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He is married and is the father of two grown and independent children, one of which already has his own family.  He has a 15 year old granddaughter who lives with him and depends on him to provide her an education and a good upbringing.  He owns his own house where he offered the best he had to his children and now he is giving everything for his granddaughter.  Francisco's work consists of transporting goods and passengers on his motorcycle taxi, a job that he has been doing for seven years.  When he first began, it was a lot of work for him, as he was not accustomed to doing that type of work.  As a result, he had many problems with his kidneys, but through time he found ways to be able to have better health and now he is an absolute expert.  What he likes about his work is that it allows him to manage his own schedule and to give himself the necessary rest when he needs it, as well as being able to have a way to get around for his family.  It is not going great, as business is a little slow, but he has an idea to put a grocery store in the front of his house and in that way have the ability to earn additional income.  This will be his seventh loan with MFP, and is very happy to know that he will have financial support since in that way he will feel more secure as he moves ahead with his work.  On the other hand he is committed to making his payments, as he has done with previous loans that he has had.  He is very happy with the work group to which he belongs since everyone is very responsible and unified with one another.  With the requested funds, he will purchase parts to repair his motorcycle taxi, as well as pay the mechanic who will complete the repairs.  He also hopes to renew the insurance for his vehicle.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":912930,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Motorcycle Transport","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"To purchase parts and have repairs done by a mechanic, as well as renewing the insurance for his vehicle","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-11-10T00:51:14Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":450,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Francisco ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-10-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1200,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":179.94},{"due_date":"2011-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":190.15},{"due_date":"2012-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":191.87},{"due_date":"2012-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":205.78},{"due_date":"2012-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":213.45},{"due_date":"2012-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":218.81}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":67.48},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71.3},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71.96},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.16},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.05},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.05}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":138.78,"local_amount":370.09,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:50:49Z","rounded_local_amount":375.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250836049},{"amount":71.96,"local_amount":191.87,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:18:06Z","rounded_local_amount":194.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257245809},{"amount":77.16,"local_amount":205.78,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:30:49Z","rounded_local_amount":208.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263385842},{"amount":80.05,"local_amount":213.45,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:29:19Z","rounded_local_amount":216.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270098932},{"amount":82.05,"local_amount":218.81,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T10:30:39Z","rounded_local_amount":221.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276713064}],"funded_date":"2011-11-30T20:59:12Z","paid_date":"2012-05-15T10:30:39Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"David Young","image":null}},{"id":359636,"name":"Ruth Miguelina","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La socia actualmente sigue con su negocio de compra y venta de ropa, la socia viaja a Lima y compra de las tiendas grandes las ofertas y cierres de temporadas, tambi\u00e9n compra de las fabricas todo tipo de ropa para damas, caballeros y ni\u00f1os, la socia tambien compra zapatos y zapatillas para ni\u00f1os y ni\u00f1as; La socia esta muy contenta porque le esta yendo muy bien y esta teniendo buenos ingresos economicos que le permiten tener y dar a su familia una mejor calidad de vida; La socia desea invertir el prestamo en la compra de ropa al por mayor ella suele viajar a laciudad de Lima con frecuencia y ahora esta planeando su viaje la semana que viene para traer ropa y novedades para esta epoca navide\u00f1a.

She has 2 children that are school age.  Before she joined the organization, her family worked in farming and had faced many difficulties.  In 1998, she and her husband had decided to join the organization to seek a loan to invest into raising livestock.  After seeing no success in the farm animals business, Ms. Le Thi T. and her husband decided to obtain another loan to start a new business.  In the beginning, she used the new loan obtained to buy large amounts of manufactured goods to sell to the people in her village and began noticing the business success. After gaining experience with this type of business, she began selling a variety of fresh food products.  She saw the demands for fresh food goods in her village and since been investing more into these goods.  Everyday her husband buys wholesale and bulk merchandise for her to sell in her home. Ms. Le Thi T. is able to bring in more customers by offering reasonable prices on her merchandises.  As a result, her business has been stable and growing.  The income of her business is 4.000.000d\/month.  She is requesting a loan of 15.000.000d to invest into buying more food products and other goods.  This will help increase her inventory, selling them to, and meeting the needs and demands of those in her in her village. \r\n<p> <b>Translated from Vietnamese by Lynn Nguyen, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\nCh\u1ecb L\u00ea th\u1ecb T.  n\u0103m nay 42 tu\u1ed5i.

Eight years later, he saw a need for a local health facility, as at the time all medical facilities were located very far from his community.

In order to provide the post abortion care services, Charles will need to purchase the appropriate medical instruments and a sterilizer. Charles is requesting a loan of 90,000 Kenya Schillings (1,200 USD) in order to buy these items, as well as to purchase a patient examination couch and improve his clinic with renovations that will add extra space to the facility. <p>\r\n\r\nIn the future, Charles would like to add a maternity ward to the clinic and grow into a small hospital.

As if that was not enough, the cold hands of death took away her first-born due to an accident, a son she had in mind to be very supportive of her.\r\n\r\nBefore her first two loans, F. had only a little to start frying Accra beans (a mixture of ground beans) and used the profits. Throughout the years, F. has suffered the consequences of poor health and of her husband refusing to supply the needs of the children. Besides that, she and her family have simply suffered the results of poverty and the accompanying challenges of life that has brought them.\r\n\r\nF., however, has the beginnings of a solid business. She has a prime location for her poultry farm and she plans to reinforce it by buying planks and steel doors. She is well known throughout the community as being trustworthy with her customers. She also has years of experience already in running a poultry and a vegetable farm, which has helped her.\r\n\r\nWith her third GHAPE loan, F. intends to invest in the poultry farm in offering chickens for sale, By expanding her business like this, she will also be able to offer manure for sale to fertilize local farms and gardens, and will also provide such essentials as oil, salt and Maggi (a soup mix) for the family.\r\n\r\nWith the profits of this business, F. will be able to afford the school fees of her other children, and will be able to continue providing good healthful medications for them. She will be able to feed her family, provide them with clothes and will have the opportunity to save for the future as well.\r\n\r\nF. came to GHAPE because of the training scheme the organization offers, because of the terms of the loans, and because the method of repayment is \u201ccomfortable and convenient\u201d.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>About GHAPE<\/b>\r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon.

She is married and has four adult children.\r\n\r\nAnita owns and operates a sari sari (general) store, selling a variety of different products in the local community. Anita has been engaged in this business for over fifteen years and earns approximately Php 6,000 a month.\r\n\r\nAnita joined NWTF in 2000 to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of Php 19,500 from NWTF.\r\n\r\nAnita is now requesting a new loan of Php 19,500 which will be used to purchase additional products to sell.

Cristina owns & operates a general store where she sells food & daily use products. Cristina has been engaged in her business for over 8 years and earns approximately 2,500 PHP a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Cristina joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. Cristina is requesting a new loan of 7,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional inventory & provide working capital. This loan will be the second loan taken out by Cristina from ASKI.

[The Agro-industrial Women's Association of San Pedro de TR.] was formed in March 1997  when they acquired a farm from the Agrarian Development Institute, which they paid off over a period of 10 years. The group is made up of 6 women who grow greenhouse vegetables such as tomatoes, string beans, and sweet peppers, as well as producing coffee on their farm. The goal of the group is to gain additional income through promoting agribusiness activities as well as to benefit families in their community with profitable projects which are in accordance with the concepts of conservation and rational use of resources. \r\n\r\nSome of the main activities of the Association are:\r\n\r\n1.\tCoordinate with the Ministry of Agriculture, the Agrarian Development Institute and other Costa Rican public institutions to receive the technical assistance these institutions provide.\r\n2.\tProduce sweet peppers, tomatoes, chile seeds, string beans and other products, through controlled methods (greenhouses) for marketing and the generation of income. \r\n3.\tMaintain a coffee plantation, owned by the Association, which provides a fixed annual income. \r\n\r\nTheir first priority was to obtain a place where they could develop organic agriculture, encouraging women in their development as businesswomen. They have a farm in the San Pedro de Valverde Vega region in Alajuela province, located in Costa Rica's Central Valley, on the slopes of the Poas volcano.  \r\n\r\nIn addition to the coffee plantation, they own an area of greenhouses. These were damaged by strong winds in December 2010, including the partial destruction of one of the roofs. For this reason, they are requesting 228000 colones ($475) to complete these repairs, to supplement their own capital of 200000 colones from the sale of string beans which were produced in the greenhouses.\r\n\r\nMission:\r\nThe Association seeks sustainable development for itself, its members, and their families, through agribusiness diversification and new production technology, in order to offer diverse quality products in the marketplace, thereby securing new markets and opportunities for development.\r\n\r\nVision:\r\nTo be a self-governed organization of women who, by means of diversifying agribusiness activities, generate opportunities for the socio-economic development of their families. \r\n\r\nOnce the loan is granted and the different activities the group does are verified, they will demonstrate their ability to repay the amount in the specified timeframe. With this investment, they will repair the greenhouse, thereby strengthening the group's vegetable production as well.\r\n\r\nThe Association owns the farm and the greenhouse infrastructure. They split work shifts among the members, so they can support the project and at the same time tend to their families. It generates supplemental household income and allows members to support their children's education and improve their quality of life. At the same time, the coffee harvest generates seasonal employment for the region's people.

This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. <P>\r\n\r\nOne of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":256693,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cloth & Dressmaking Supplies","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":" To buy more fabrics for making clothes for re-sale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mwanza","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.516667 32.9","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-01-18T15:00:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Face","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-30T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-04-29T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-05-29T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:04:40Z","rounded_local_amount":52000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20436433},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-03-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:57:44Z","rounded_local_amount":52000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130705},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-04-29T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:26:50Z","rounded_local_amount":52000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027502},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-05-29T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:15:32Z","rounded_local_amount":52000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613503},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-06-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:03:21Z","rounded_local_amount":52000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010582},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-07-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:39:36Z","rounded_local_amount":52000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63232873},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-08-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:53:43Z","rounded_local_amount":52000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73664674},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-09-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T02:47:42Z","rounded_local_amount":52000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87105405},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-10-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T06:28:24Z","rounded_local_amount":52000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97022550},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-11-25T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:42:22Z","rounded_local_amount":52000.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103867799}],"funded_date":"2009-01-18T15:13:04Z","paid_date":"2009-12-15T14:42:22Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":88351,"name":"Christiana","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Christiana is a 49-year-old businesswoman.

He's married and the father of three children, out of which the two elder ones attend school. When he was a little boy, he started going fishing with his father. Today, his fishing business enables him to provide for himself and his entire family. Hodonou Jacob already benefited from two loans from Kiva's partner Alid\u00e9. When Hodonou Jacob compares his current living standard with his situation before he obtained the loans, he sees a clear improvement. With this third loan, he plans to buy new fishnets. In the course of the year, he would like to buy various kinds of fishnets in order to make his business more profitable.\r\n<p>\r\n<i>Alid\u00e9 means \u201cthere is always a path for the poorest\u201d in Benin\u2019s local language of Fon.

Maria has a clothing sale business, which is located on the second floor of the Sagrado Coraz\u00f3n market, a market frequented by affluent people due to its location in the centre of the Salvadorean capital. \r\n\r\nMaria has worked doing this for 15 years.

With the wish of improving her business, Maria is seeking a loan from Integral, to be able to stock her shop with skirts, blouses, trousers, and children's and adult's clothing in many styles.

T. is the group leader of a 6 member group, which has requested a loan from SEDA.  While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they all are responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.  The official name of this borrowing group is Ng\u00f4 N\u1ed9i nh\u00f3m 06 (Nh\u00f3m 06).\r\n<p>\r\nT. is married and has one infant-aged child.  To making a living, T. owns and operates a manufacturing business.  While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from manufacturing and selling wood products to local businesses and community members.  T. has been engaged in this business for over three years and earns approximately 3.000.000 VND a month from these activities.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2009, T. joined SEDA to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities.  T. has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5.152.000 VND from SEDA.  This previous loan was used to purchase raw materials to manufacture additional products.  She is now requesting a new loan of 6.496.000 VND which will also be used to purchase raw materials to manufacture additional products.  The loan will be the second loan taken out by the borrower from SEDA.  T. plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to financially support extended members of her family.\r\n<p>\r\nAbout the other borrowers in the group:\r\n<p>\r\n1.

The group is working in its 15th loan cycle with 15 members.  \r\n<p>\r\nThese ladies engage in different businesses such as retail, handicrafts, dressmaking, and other activities.  This committee is one of the oldest at its branch office.  A spirit of solidarity has already developed among its members and the group has succeeded in keeping its internal finances in order.  The members are disciplined with their payments and have always paid on time in each of their loan cycles.  \r\n<p>\r\nAnother characteristic of the members is that they are always conscientious when requesting their loans, and as a result they adjust their payment behavior accordingly.  Since they do not have a large line of credit, they always request the maximum amount because they claim it will help cover their corresponding business activities.\r\n<p>\r\nSra. Jacinta C. is 45 years old and works as a seamstress.  Her husband Esteban Florentin works as a tailor.  They have three children.\r\n<p>\r\nDo\u00f1a Jacinta has one main objective \u2013 to help her daughter finish her university studies.  She is currently earning her degree in Accounting.  Being a parent, Jacinta intends to make sacrifices in order to cover her daughter\u2019s education.  In the future, she plans to cover the studies of her other daughter who is in eighth grade.\r\n<p>\r\nJacinta wants to increase her income by acquiring materials to expand her business.  She plans to produce more varieties of clothing based on the size of her customer base and the level of demand that exists.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva

Judith has been operating her own hair and beauty salon for the past three years. The salon is open between 7:30 am and 9 pm daily and earns Judith a good monthly profit. \r\n\r\nThis will be Judith's 3rd Motisha loan with Tujijenge Tanzania. A Mothisha loan is a product offered by Tujijenge Tanzania that allows borrowers with good credit ratings to pay back their original loans faster and receive extra money before their original loan term has ended. \r\n\r\nJudith used her previous loans to expand her salon, loans which she has successfully repaid.

They make deliveries mostly, and also sell retail. They work four days a week for five or six hours a day or until they finish selling what they bought.\r\n\r\nThis loan is to purchase fish, shrimp, and other varieties of shellfish to give their customers the best.

all over the age of 15. They live in a 2-room apartment in the Tumuku quarter of the Belo subdivision in Cameroon. In 2009, hardship and tough times led Regina to become a member of GHAPE. She got her first loan of 50,000 XAF and embarked on the buying and selling of goats, earning enough to move on with life.\r\n\r\nRegina is requesting her second loan in order to buy goats for 60,000 XAF, beans for 20,000 XAF and to pay workers on her farm 20,000 XAF. She knows she is going to succeed because she has been keeping goats for a long time and had been farming long before she got to GHAPE. Her trade is actually helping the community since she offers door-to-door service. Regina has faced challenges in life when her daughter had an accident and was hospitalized and when one of her son's hands was cut off. The profit from Regina's loan will be used to take care of her and her children's health and to invest in her agriculture. Regina prefers GHAPE because she can repay in bits.\r\n  \r\nAbout GHAPE \r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon.  GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach.

History of note includes: it was once a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; the birthplace of the great Persian poet Rudaki; and the birthplace of the most famous Islamic philosopher Ibn Sina (Avicenna). The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p> \r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n<p>\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients have a viable business proposition when they request a loan.

persevere and love what you do. This is what Elsie M. is doing to attain her dreams with the help of NWTF-Project Dungganon.\r\n\r\nElsie is 40 years old, and married to Leonilo, who helps her run their scrap business. They have 4 children who are between 10 and 18 years old. 2 are in college and the younger 2 are in high school and grade school. The family lives in Prk. Kulitis, Barrio Dos Hermanas, Talisay City, Negros Occidental. It is one of Elsie's most cherished dreams that her children be able to finish college and have their own stable and comfortable livelihoods when they grow up.\r\n\r\nConcerned for her children's future, Elsie joined NWTF Project Dungganon in 2002 so that she could increase her capital in their scrap business. With the added buying capability, she was able to buy back more recyclables like scrap iron, bottles, plastic, etc. Now she is earning approximately PHP 30,000 per month from her business operations. \r\n\r\nFrom this she was able to buy a motorcycle and a small pickup truck for faster delivery of her scrap materials. She has also happily set aside some amount for her children's education.\r\n\r\nElsie's previous loan of PHP 15,000 was used as revolving capital for her scrap business and now that she's paid that off, she is borrowing the same amount so that she could continue maintaining her scrap buyback levels and be able to sell the scrap in volume, earning a neat profit.\r\n \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros  Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project <I>Dungganon<\/I>(a Hiligaynon word that means <I>Honorable<\/I>). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is  empowering these women to progress out of earning less than $1 a day to  achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them <I>Dungganon<\/I> -  a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":436277,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Recycled Materials","sector":"Retail","themes":["Green"],"use":"Additional Working Capital","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Silay, Negros Occidental","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":145,"posted_date":"2009-12-02T03:30:18Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elsie","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-11-11T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":15000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":1153.84},{"due_date":"2009-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":1153.84},{"due_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":1153.84},{"due_date":"2009-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":1153.84},{"due_date":"2009-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":1153.84},{"due_date":"2010-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":1153.84},{"due_date":"2010-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":1153.84},{"due_date":"2010-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":1153.84},{"due_date":"2010-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":1153.84},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1153.84},{"due_date":"2010-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":1153.84},{"due_date":"2010-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":1153.84},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1153.92}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":175,"local_amount":8077,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T15:59:40Z","rounded_local_amount":8225.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110739716},{"amount":50,"local_amount":2308,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:15:06Z","rounded_local_amount":2350.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118129135},{"amount":75,"local_amount":3461.08,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:53:54Z","rounded_local_amount":3524.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123965932},{"amount":25,"local_amount":1153.92,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:37:38Z","rounded_local_amount":1175.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128997843}],"funded_date":"2009-12-02T04:39:35Z","paid_date":"2010-04-15T09:37:38Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Courtney Crockett","image":null}},{"id":162360,"name":"Isak","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Isak T. is 48 years old and married with three children. Isak sells dried fruits in the local central market. He has had this business for 5 years already. Dried fruits are very popular in Tajikistan. Any hostess has some in store for serving, in case guests arrive at the house. In addition, dried fruits are, as a rule, served during all important family occasions, such as wedding parties, birthday parties and the like. Considering the constant demand for his goods, Isak's business is quite successful and brings in a stable income for his family. Isak has a large and friendly family, who always try to help each other. Now, he wants to increase his stock of goods so as to be able to better meet the demands of his buyers. With this purpose in mind, he is requesting a loan of $1,500. He will spend the loan on the purchase of dried fruits in order to increase the range he has for sale. Isak has already demonstrated himself to be a good client and has a positive credit history. He would like to thank everyone for their support, and promises to pay back the loan on time.   \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She sells different varieties of fruit in the market. She is very fair in her rates and makes good sales every day. She always gets up early in the morning to go the market because the market is far away from her house. \r\n\r\nDue to the long distance, she decided to buy a motorbike. She lacks money, so she would like to request some funding from HKL's partnership with Kiva.  She will use this funding to buy a motorbike to transport her fruit to the market in time. She will also use a part of the money to purchase more fresh seasonal fruit. \r\n\r\nShe is very experienced in her business and has been operating it for the past 6 years. Nao is confident about the positive growth of her business after the loan investment. She is the mother of ten children. Six of them are already married and live independently and the other four are enrolled in school.

She is blessed to have 6 children whom she loves more than his life and for whom she works hard, so that they have a good quality of life.\n\nChristine has been practicing mixed farming for the last five years and has gained so much experience. To afford a decent and comfortable life for her children, she has been selling milk, eggs and a variety of food crops from her farmland. To make ends meet and make extra cash, she has been engaged in a small \u201cside hustle\u201d business. \n\nThe Moek area is very populated and demand for cereal products such as maize and beans is very high. Like many farmers from her region, she finds cereal selling very enjoyable.\n\nChristine biggest challenge, however, is meeting the demand, which is really high. She lacks funds to increase her cereal business, so she is seeking a loan of 35,000 KES (Kenyan shillings) to buy different varieties of cereals.\nComing from Kenya which is a third world country and accessing funds is challenging but through institutions such as Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva, she feels relieved knowing that her dream will be achieved, and that she will be able to buy more cereals. \n\nThrough the loan, she will sell cereals to her neighbours and to the local market; this will translate to increased profit margins and an improved income level. Being a visionary woman, she intends to accumulate more profits and increase her cereal sales to other markets as this will increase her income and improve her living conditions. \n\nThe extra income Christine will earn will be used to fully repay the loan and permanently change her living conditions by building a modern house and also to secure the future of her school-aged children.\n"}},"status":"inactive","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":2046597,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy cereals from farmers to resell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Nandi Hills","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Christine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-11-13T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":35000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":2477.05},{"due_date":"2016-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":2549.45},{"due_date":"2016-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":2623.95},{"due_date":"2016-03-13T08:00:00Z","amount":2700.64},{"due_date":"2016-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":2779.57},{"due_date":"2016-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":2860.8},{"due_date":"2016-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":2944.4},{"due_date":"2016-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":3030.45},{"due_date":"2016-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":3119.02},{"due_date":"2016-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":3210.17},{"due_date":"2016-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":3303.99},{"due_date":"2016-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":3400.51}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":24.77},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25.49},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.24},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.01},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.8},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.61},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.44},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.3},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.19},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.1},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.04},{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.01}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":2343,"name":"Veronica Concepcion","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"My name is Concepcion and I sell clothes, make-up, tablecloths, ornaments and other household items.

She lives in her own house with her 17 year old daughter named Saly.  For the last 10 years, she has devoted herself to selling office and paper supplies in a stall at a market near her house. This business has proved to be quite profitable. Thanks to her friendly and charismatic manner with customers, she has been able to obtain a good number of loyal customers. Ida always tries to have her stand well supplied.  She doesn't like not having an item that a customer specifically requests in stock, so she tries to have some of everything on hand.  Ida enjoys her work very much because it makes her feel independent and she can provide her daughter with a high quality of life.  Her daughter comes to the stand to help Ida with sales.  \r\n\r\nIn the future, Ida would like to expand her business  in order to increase her income for her family.  This is her ninth loan with MFP.  She always has been very punctual with her payments and commits to continue being so.

She has carried on this business for 5 years now, and she maintains a spacious and well-equipped workplace to suit her customers' needs as best she can.  She tells us that her daily income is very good, on account of the special seasoning she uses on all the food that she prepares.  Her main customers are either city residents, passers-by on the street, or regular customers who are already familiar with her food.  She is able to count on a good turn-out of customers every day.  \r\nWith her first loan of 300 Nuevos Soles, she bought bulk amounts of chicken, rice, and kilos of sugar.  This enabled her to begin growing her business, and bit by bit her reputation grew.  Today she continues with her same business, servicing the customers who continue to visit her every day.  She personally attends to her customers to provide them with the delicious flavors and friendliness that characterizes her enterprise.  \r\nWith this loan of 3,000 Nuevos Soles, she will buy more bulk chicken, rice and sugar, as well as liters of oil.  She will also buy new kitchen utensils to replace the old ones she currently uses, enabling her to offer nicer service to her customers.  \r\nLoisith feels very confident in her ability to continue succeeding with her business, and she is very motivated to continue working hard for her success, so that she can achieve a calm, happy life.  She thanks the Movimiento Manuela Ramos for the assistance it has given her in achieving her goals and dreams.  \r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Kevin Lenhart, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":485844,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Catering","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Comprar\u00e1 insumos para la preparacion de sus alimentos como arroz , az\u00facar en kilos , etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"San Mart\u00edn","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":72,"posted_date":"2010-02-10T22:30:13Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1050,"lender_count":27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Loisith ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-01-21T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2010-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2010-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2010-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2010-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2010-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":175,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2010-02-21T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:44:21Z","rounded_local_amount":502.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123954539},{"amount":175,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2010-03-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-23T07:54:44Z","rounded_local_amount":502.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128987565},{"amount":175,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2010-04-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-02T07:56:29Z","rounded_local_amount":502.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136713591},{"amount":175,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2010-05-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-26T08:09:39Z","rounded_local_amount":502.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144746637},{"amount":175,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2010-06-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-27T07:49:01Z","rounded_local_amount":502.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151929808},{"amount":175,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2010-07-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-28T07:53:11Z","rounded_local_amount":502.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159668984}],"funded_date":"2010-02-11T03:18:16Z","paid_date":"2010-08-28T07:53:11Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kevin Lenhart","image":null}},{"id":179118,"name":"Rubelyn","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rubelyn A. is from the village of Pangantucan, Bukidnon.

The members of the group sell fish, ice, gourds, and clothing. \r\n\r\nWith the goal of increasing their earnings the members of the group decided to integrate with the microfinance organization Soro Yiriwaso (Kiva Field Partner) and they are on their seventh loan cycle. \r\n\r\nMrs. Kadia Tebe is well known and sought out in  Pelengana, especially during the wedding season (at the beginning of the rainy season) for the quality of the gourds she sells. \r\n\r\nShe will use her loan to purchase 3 packs of gourds (about one hundred grouds). She stocks up her supply of gourds in Tonan and in Segou and in the fields of Noumou Were, for those that are decorated. She completes her sales in cash and in credit, sometimes taking orders from private homes and in the market Chateau de Segoup and in Bamako. Her clientele is mostly made up of women. \r\n\r\nWith the help of this loan Mrs. Kadia Tebe hopes to earn a monthly income of 30FCFC which will be used to reinvest back into her business and part will be placed in savings. Her goal is to purchase a plot of land to build a house. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Erika Lindig, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":900,"image":{"id":603462,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Decorations Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"To purchase gourds.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"S\u00e9gou","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:20Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":900,"lender_count":29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Aminata         ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dj\u00e8n\u00e8ba            ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Houma                 ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kadia     ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Korotimi      ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mah         ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":450000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75000},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75000},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75000},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75000},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75000},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":150,"local_amount":75000,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T16:14:43Z","rounded_local_amount":75264.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177476868},{"amount":150,"local_amount":75000,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:40:04Z","rounded_local_amount":75264.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182613579},{"amount":150,"local_amount":75000,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T14:42:55Z","rounded_local_amount":75264.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188752007},{"amount":150,"local_amount":75000,"processed_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-17T00:56:36Z","rounded_local_amount":75264.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191606258},{"amount":150,"local_amount":75000,"processed_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T12:19:41Z","rounded_local_amount":75264.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195917927},{"amount":150,"local_amount":75000,"processed_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T12:12:09Z","rounded_local_amount":75264.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201360857}],"funded_date":"2010-10-04T18:36:01Z","paid_date":"2011-04-15T12:12:09Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":236723,"name":"United Sisters I Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Adama J.

He is a refrigeration technician, a barber and a merchant; he owns a small, home-based grocery store.\r\n\r\nHe\u2019s been a merchant for 20 years because back in the 80s he had a small bar\/eatery that he had for 15 years.  Five years ago he decided to go into refrigeration repairs, learn barbering and set up a small grocery store where he sells water, soft drinks and juice.  His wife and children help him tend to the store.\r\n\r\nHe needs the loan to buy barbering supplies and tools, tools to work in refrigeration and to buy soft drinks and juice for the grocery store.  With this investment he will be able to do the refrigeration jobs more quickly, have work tools that will allow him to work in the barber shop more efficiently and the stock in his grocery store will improve income.  His next goals are to improve the barber shop\u2019s locale, to have a better established grocery store and to buy a motorcycle for work.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":807570,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy barber shop supplies, tools for refrigertion repair work and to buy soft drinks and juice for his grocery store.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Leon","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.435556 -86.879444","type":"point"}},"partner_id":176,"posted_date":"2011-07-28T07:20:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":500,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Norman  David","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-06-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.66},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.66},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.66},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.66},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.66},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.66},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.66},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.66},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":41.67,"local_amount":41.67,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T09:57:11Z","rounded_local_amount":41.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227086394},{"amount":41.66,"local_amount":41.66,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:46:24Z","rounded_local_amount":41.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232848182},{"amount":41.66,"local_amount":41.66,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:54:36Z","rounded_local_amount":41.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238663308},{"amount":41.66,"local_amount":41.66,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-16T09:04:02Z","rounded_local_amount":41.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244770002},{"amount":333.35,"local_amount":333.35,"processed_date":"2011-12-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:47:19Z","rounded_local_amount":333.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250832575}],"funded_date":"2011-08-25T02:55:20Z","paid_date":"2012-01-15T10:47:19Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":318685,"name":"Mazera","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mazera is a married woman with three children, all of whom attend school.

","en":"Nurjan is a 27-year-old married woman with two children, aged 2 and 3.  She works as an English language teacher at a village school.  Unfortunately, her teaching salary does not allow Nurjan to cover all of her family's expenses.  Livestock breeding and crop-farming are an additional source of income for Nurjan and her family.

community bank, Villa Mayo, in Huancavelica. This area is known for its new types of potatoes and a chilly climate. The community bank is maD. up of 11 members.\r\n\r\nMartha S. Q. lives in Huancavelica with her husband and two children, aged 10 & 5. She has a small grocery store with a phone service. The grocery store started small yet she is improving little by little. The area has its problems, she says, as her business is sometimes too small to cover her necessities. The loan will be invested immediately in the store by purchasing more goods that her clients are interested in.\r\n\r\nAfter joining FINCA Per\u00fa she has been able to improve her business, and is very grateful that she has been able to save more and invest more in her business. Right now, Martha is saving the income she receives from her business to fulfill her dreams of making sure her children are educated to become professionals, and she would also like to move and start her business in another area, Huancayo. \r\n\r\nAna Q. R., another member of the group, also lives in Huancavelica with her husband and 3 year old son. Her business, which she has had for two and a half years, includes the buying and selling of animals such as pigs and cows. Though her business is doing well now, she has had some trouble in the past, as do all start-up businesses. Since Ana joined FINCA Per\u00fa her business has improved and she can only hope it will continue to do so. The loan she has requested will be invested in her business for the purchase of more animals and to increase her capital. She is currently saving to buy a house in Huancayo and start her business there. In addition, she hopes that with the success of her business she will be able to put her son in a good school."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1650,"image":{"id":209896,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To improve their businesses","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":70,"posted_date":"2008-10-07T16:30:40Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1650,"lender_count":45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Martha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dionisia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Adelaida","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Paulina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Albina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Natividad","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Emilia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eudocia Victoria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bertha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-10-21T20:17:04Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":4900,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":816.67},{"due_date":"2008-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":816.67},{"due_date":"2009-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":816.67},{"due_date":"2009-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":816.67},{"due_date":"2009-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":816.67},{"due_date":"2009-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":816.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":275},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":275},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":275},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":275},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":275},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":275}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":275,"local_amount":816.67,"processed_date":"2008-11-21T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-16T04:10:14Z","rounded_local_amount":818.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5314820},{"amount":275,"local_amount":816.67,"processed_date":"2008-12-21T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-15T20:44:36Z","rounded_local_amount":818.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9932437},{"amount":275,"local_amount":816.67,"processed_date":"2009-01-21T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T12:09:59Z","rounded_local_amount":818.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":10214732},{"amount":275,"local_amount":816.67,"processed_date":"2009-02-21T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T08:25:45Z","rounded_local_amount":818.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20396462},{"amount":275,"local_amount":816.67,"processed_date":"2009-03-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T18:13:37Z","rounded_local_amount":818.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27088273},{"amount":275,"local_amount":816.65,"processed_date":"2009-04-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T16:06:56Z","rounded_local_amount":818.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35981810}],"funded_date":"2008-10-07T20:17:04Z","paid_date":"2009-05-15T16:06:56Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Brett & Margaret Silberg","image":null}},{"id":72015,"name":"Aldi Forti Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This is Majula S. and Abdul B..

Her work ethic and love for her family motivated her to start her own grocery business.  It has gradually increased as she has gained more experience.  She is well-known and respected by her clientele.  She currently has regular customers who come to her store to shop because it has all the products a housewife would need.  Judith personally welcomes everyone with her cheerful and enthusiastic attitude.\r\n<p>\r\nWith this loan of 1200 soles, she will buy sacks of rice and sugar, packets of noodles, milk, various brands of canned fish, crates of eggs, and personal hygiene products. This will help her continue to provide good service to her customers.\r\n<p>\r\nJudith hopes to expand and improve her small grocery store.  She plans to make it a reality because she is the type of woman who completes what she sets out to do.  She thanks the Manuela Ramos organization for their support and helping other women who want to get ahead.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":399241,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Purchase groceries to increase her inventory","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"San Mart\u00edn","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":72,"posted_date":"2009-10-03T06:50:16Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"lender_count":2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Judith ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-09-03T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1200,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2009-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2009-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2010-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2010-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2010-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":200}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.84},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.84},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.83}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":70.83,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2009-10-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T01:53:35Z","rounded_local_amount":204.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96990584},{"amount":70.84,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2009-11-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:38:31Z","rounded_local_amount":204.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103835610},{"amount":70.83,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2009-12-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T15:05:33Z","rounded_local_amount":204.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110727344},{"amount":70.83,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2010-01-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:05:17Z","rounded_local_amount":204.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118117693},{"amount":70.84,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2010-02-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:43:20Z","rounded_local_amount":204.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123953463},{"amount":70.83,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2010-03-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:29:26Z","rounded_local_amount":204.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128986675}],"funded_date":"2009-10-03T18:54:34Z","paid_date":"2010-04-15T09:29:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ronan Reodica","image":498323}},{"id":145841,"name":"Dorothy","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Dorothy is 40 years old and married with six children.

Ganbaatar operates a raw material  and meat trading business in his town. He sells animal skins, primarily sheep and goat skins during spring time. During winter, he mainly sells meat and meat products for which the price is higher than any other season. He started his business in 1997. Over the years, Ganbaatar has become quite experienced in raw materials trading and has built a stable operation. He is now planning to expand his business in the near future. Ganbaatar's business is very important to him and his family.
