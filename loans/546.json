This group-lending methodology ensures that members cooperate to help one another repay their loans and invest wisely in their businesses and families.<\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":950,"image":{"id":93658,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"She will use the next loan from Esperanza to invest in more fishing supplies","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"DO","country":"Dominican Republic","town":"Saman\u00e1","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"19 -70.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":44,"posted_date":"2007-12-08T00:25:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":950,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Oferlina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Luisa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Cruz","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Andrea","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-12-22T04:52:21Z","disbursal_currency":"DOP","disbursal_amount":31000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":950,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":5166.67},{"due_date":"2008-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":5166.67},{"due_date":"2008-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":5166.67},{"due_date":"2008-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":5166.67},{"due_date":"2008-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":5166.67},{"due_date":"2008-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":5166.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":158.33},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":158.33},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":158.33},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":158.33},{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":158.33},{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":158.35}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":159,"local_amount":5188.42,"processed_date":"2008-01-22T10:15:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-22T09:24:47Z","rounded_local_amount":5312.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":120023},{"amount":159,"local_amount":5188.42,"processed_date":"2008-02-22T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-22T09:24:47Z","rounded_local_amount":5312.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":140182},{"amount":159,"local_amount":5188.42,"processed_date":"2008-03-22T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-22T09:24:47Z","rounded_local_amount":5312.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":163713},{"amount":159,"local_amount":5188.42,"processed_date":"2008-04-22T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-22T09:24:47Z","rounded_local_amount":5312.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188690},{"amount":159,"local_amount":5188.42,"processed_date":"2008-05-22T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-22T09:24:47Z","rounded_local_amount":5312.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216632},{"amount":155,"local_amount":5057.89,"processed_date":"2008-06-22T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-22T09:24:47Z","rounded_local_amount":5178.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":245533}],"funded_date":"2007-12-08T04:52:21Z","paid_date":"2008-06-22T09:04:57Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":30644,"name":"Noem\u00ed","description":{"languages":["es"],"texts":{"es":"Noem\u00ed is a young girl who recently got married.

Leonora has successfully repaid a previous loan of 7000 PHP from GDMPC. Leonora is requesting a new loan of 10000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell.

Usmonbek is a 37-year-old businessman. He is married and together with his wife they have 4 children. Usmonbek is a farmer, like his wife. They started their work 15 years ago. The beginning was very difficult, because they needed to invest a lot of working capital. With much effort and the help of his wife, he was able to move forward and today has a large plot of land. \r\n\r\nHis vegetables are very good quality which he says is due to the constant irrigation they receive since the business has a complete underground irrigation system. Usmonbek requests the loan for the purchase of fertilizer and seeds. This will allow him to better provide for his family.  \r\n \r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

At this time, she is working hard to continually provide for her family. A dream for most Filipino parents like Lourdes, as she herself has been a college undergraduate and believes that a college diploma is the best inheritance parents could leave to their children.\r\n\r\nLourdes operates a food stall. In the Philippines, the whole working community and most of the families only eat home-cooked meals during evenings when all of the family members are at home to take part in the meal. This is not only a usual family tradition but a matter of convenience and frugal living. It is considered a waste of money and time to spend cooking gas and food for one to two persons when buying cooked rice and viands cost less than raw food.

He sells fruit, soft drinks, bread and cold meats.  He has had this business since 2007 when he only maD. and sold bread.  He later added a snack bar and started selling fruit and meat.  Rafael only sells the bread and wheat-flour-based products that he bakes in his bakery which is well positioned.  In addition to Rafael, an employee, his wife and one of his daughters also work in the business.  It has a good turnover of customers because, as well as being located on a corner, there is also a large school in the area and the students are always buying from him.\r\n\r\nRafael's contribution margin is 35% and he currently has a net profit that will allow him to cover his expected loan instalments.  His family and operating expenses are similar.  His accounts payable are low and he doesn't sell much on credit.  Most of his total assets are fixed assets.  He currently has  low debts and all are short term.  His working capital ratio is good because he has low debts.  His inventory turnover period is quite high because many of his products are perishable.  His profit on sales is 21% owing to his high contribution margin.  His business is very profitable and he has good creditworthiness.  His goal is to better equip his snack bar with fixtures and fittings that will allow him to proviD. a better service to his customers.\r\n\r\nRafael is approaching Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo for his first loan through Kiva in order to buy bakery and snack bar supplies wholesale such as wheat flour, sugar, fat and fruit.

menores hijos en una casa alquilada que les facilit\u00f3 un familiar de ella.\n\nC\u00e9sar est\u00e1 seguro que s\u00f3lo se sale adelante con esfuerzo y dedicaci\u00f3n, y mejor a\u00fan cuando se trabaja en lo que mejor se sabe hacer. Por eso, desde hace 10 a\u00f1os, junto a su esposa, siembra en terrenos arrendados papa y arveja, y tambi\u00e9n cr\u00edan tres asnos que le ayudan a trasladar los insumos y herramientas agr\u00edcolas hacia sus terrenos. Lo que m\u00e1s lo motiva es cosechar, pues le permite apreciar la calidad de producci\u00f3n que obtuvo. Por otro lado le disgusta tener que caminar hasta m\u00e1s de una hora para labrar su chacra, pero no se da por vencido porque considera que su labor le es muy rentable, ya que nunca ha perdido lo invertido sino por el contrario le alcanza para solventar la educaci\u00f3n de sus hijos, cubrir los gastos dom\u00e9sticos e incluso para ahorrar. Para m\u00e1s adelante planea construir su casa propia y comprar m\u00e1s hect\u00e1reas de tierra que le den mayores ingresos para que pueda brindarle una adecuada calidad de vida a su familia.    \n\nEste es el cuarto pr\u00e9stamo que tiene con MFP y como ya conoce la metodolog\u00eda de trabajo de su banco comunal, est\u00e1 muy gustoso de continuar laborando activamente con su grupo, el cual est\u00e1 integrado por personas que respetan lo establecido en su reglamento interno y son puntuales en los pagos. Con el dinero ahora solicitado tiene pensado comprar una bolsa y media de semilla de arveja, cinco sacos de fertilizantes y tres botellas de insecticidas para fumigar sus sembr\u00edos.","en":"C\u00e9sar is 34 years old.  He lives with his 29-year-old wife Susana and their 3 small children in a house that they rent from a relative of hers.\r\n\r\nC\u00e9sar is sure that he can get ahead with effort and dedication, because when he works he knows that it is what he does best.  For 10 years now he and his wife have planted potatoes and peas on the fields that they rent, and have also raised three donkeys that help them to transport the supplies and agricultural tools to the fields.  What motivates C\u00e9sar the most is harvesting, since it allows him to appreciate the quality of the crop that he has obtained.  On the other hand, what he doesn\u2019t like is having to walk for mO. than an hour to work on his farm.  He doesn\u2019t give up, though, because he considers his work very worthwhile, since he has never lost what he has invested; on the contrary, he has managed to pay for his children\u2019s education, meet his household\u2019s expenses, and even to save some money.  To get further ahead he plans to construct his own house and purchase mO. hectares of land that would give him mO. income.

He is very happy to continue to work actively with his group, which is made up of people who respect the group\u2019s established rules and who are punctual in their payments.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Its target is improving the living conditions of its members through economic activities, education, cultural and social activities, the creation of solidarity within the fellowship and mutual assistance to members. The members are in the 26-52 age group. All members are illiterate except the secretary that manages administrative and bookkeeping documents. The fellowship already received three credits of $400;$1000, and $1500 that were all reimbursed smoothly. \r\n \r\nJust like the entire Ahonkp\u00e8 village, this group of women is confronted with a serious problem of potable water. The consequences are very dramatic in a village where child mortality rate is very high. The main drinking water source is a stagnant water pool exposed to all sort of water born diseases. So they had the interesting humanitarian idea of realising a drilling with views to providing the village with potable water to guarantee the health of the population chiefly the children. \r\n\r\nOn that purpose, the female fellowship \u201cNOVISSI of Ahonkp\u00e8\u201d applied for a credit of $ 2000 to achieve its project of water drilling in order to sell water to the entire population of the village. Financing this project is not only an economic action but also a humanitarian one: it will help contribute to the reduction of the child mortality rate in the village of Ahonkp\u00e8, in the suburban area of Lom\u00e9. \r\n\r\n<p> \r\n\r\nNOVISSI de Ahonkp\u00e8 est un groupe de solidarit\u00e9 constitu\u00e9 de douze (12) femmes cr\u00e9\u00e9 il y a quatre (04) ans. Il a pour objectif, am\u00e9liorer les conditions de vie de ses membres par l\u2019exercice des activit\u00e9s \u00e9conomiques, \u00e9ducatrices, culturelles et sociales, cr\u00e9er une solidarit\u00e9 en son sein et faire des entraides mutuelles entre les membres. L\u2019\u00e2ge des membres varie entre 26 ans et 52 ans. Tous les membres sont analphab\u00e8tes \u00e0 l\u2019exception de la secr\u00e9taire qui tient les documents administratifs et comptables. Le groupement a d\u00e9j\u00e0 b\u00e9n\u00e9fici\u00e9 de trois cr\u00e9dits respectivement de $400, $1000 et $1500 qui sont tous bien rembours\u00e9s sans incident.\r\n\r\nCe groupe de femme tout comme le village de Ahonkp\u00e8 est confront\u00e9 au probl\u00e8me s\u00e9rieux d\u2019eau potable. Les cons\u00e9quences sont tr\u00e8s dramatiques dans ce village o\u00f9 le mortalit\u00e9 enfantine est tr\u00e8s \u00e9lev\u00e9. La principale eau de consommation est un point d\u2019eau stagnante expos\u00e9 \u00e0 toute sorte de maladie hydrique. Alors, elles ont eu cette id\u00e9e g\u00e9niale et humanitaire de faire un forage afin de doter le village d\u2019eau potable pour garantir la bonne sant\u00e9 de la population surtout celle des enfants. \r\n\r\nA cet effet, le groupement f\u00e9minin \u00ab NOVISSI de Ahonkp\u00e8 \u00bb sollicite un cr\u00e9dit de $2000 pour r\u00e9aliser son projet de forage dont l\u2019eau sera vendue \u00e0 la population. Financer ce projet, est un acte non seulement \u00e9conomique mais plut\u00f4t humanitaire : contribuer \u00e0 la r\u00e9duction du taux de mortalit\u00e9 enfantine dans le village de Ahonkp\u00e8,

A., 32 years of age and a native of Nampula, did not attend school beyond the 5th grade because of the war. He arrived in the province of Maputo in the company of his oldest sibling in 1995 and encountered the necessity of starting a small business in an ambulatory regime. Later, he acknowledged this endeavor as a good idea now that the conditions of starting a business had already materialized in a fixed location, also because he had married and needed to better organize his life. Today he is a father of 2 children. Through his neighbors he obtained information about the services provided by Hluvuku-Adsema (Field Partner), who he approached and solicited an initial low-cost loan. He was able to open a bank account and start a small savings in case of an emergency. Right now, he employs 4 people and supports the basic familial expenses. With this loan he intends to expand his business by diversifying the products he sells. His business\u2019 impact on the community is a positive one: he provides employment for himself, his wife and his sister-in-law; he places the product as close as possible to the consumers of his village. His future plans include expanding the business and offering employment to more people in the community. <p> <b>Translated from Portuguese by Marco Alves, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>Armando A. de 32 anos de idade, natural de Nampula por causa de guerra n\u00e3o conseguiu estudar para alem da 5 classe.\r\nChegou na prov\u00edncia de Maputo na companhia do seu irm\u00e3o mais velho em 1995 e viu a necessidade de iniciar um pequeno neg\u00f3cio em regime ambulat\u00f3rio mais tarde achou por bem e j\u00e1 criada as condi\u00e7\u00f5es de fazer o neg\u00f3cio no local fixo tamb\u00e9m porque j\u00e1 tinha se casado e precisava organizar-se melhor.\r\n\r\nHoje \u00e9 pai de 2 filhos e conta que atrav\u00e9s dos vizinhos obteve a informa\u00e7\u00e3o sobre os servi\u00e7os que a HLUVUKU ADSEMA presta \u00e0 popula\u00e7\u00e3o de Boane, tendo aproximado e solicitado o primeiro empr\u00e9stimo num valor bastante reduzido tendo em conta as capacidades de financiamento da institui\u00e7\u00e3o. \r\n\r\nConseguiu abrir uma conta banc\u00e1ria e come\u00e7ou a fazer pequenas poupan\u00e7as para os momentos de crise.

For this reason, he had to abandon his studies and start making money to provide for his family. He was trained as a tailor by several master tailors in the city of Sikasso. After 17 years of experience, he became a master tailor known all over Sikasso. His workshop, located in the grand market, is a melting pot of styles and designs, and is very much visited by a diverse clientele.\r\n\r\nTo satisfy an increasing number of ever more demanding requests from his customers, he decided to join the loan program of the microfinance organisation Soro Yiriwaso, in order to buy a new embroidery machine, seven pieces of tinted \"bazin\" (a sort of damask) in Bamako (the capital of the Republic of Mali), and 200 meters of men's fabric in Bobo Dioulasso (in Burkina Faso, Western Africa).

This is 48-year-old Edda M. from Tukuyu. She is married and has four children between the ages of 15 and 20. Edda has run a timber-selling business since 2004, buying wood from the forest and selling it in towns.\r\n\r\nShe works four hours a day, seven days a week and has one employee. Edda currently earns about $400 a month from her business. She is requesting a loan of $375 to purchase additional timber. In the future, she plans to increase her stock even further -- and by doing that, expand her small company. Edda thanks you for your support!\r\n\r\nABOUT SELFINA:\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions.

Since she separated from her husband, she has had to take on the role of both father and mother in her home, which is very difficult.  But she has the support of her parents, who offered her their home and their affection.  With all of the problems she had to go through, she never stopped being an optimist with regard to her future.  She had all of the strength necessary to work in many jobs to pay for her home's expenses and saved enough to have her own business with her sister.  Now they are planning to obtain another stand in the market.  However, to accomplish this, they will have to keep selling starting at 6:00 a.m.  Mothers start visiting the markets very early so they can have the afternoons free to attend to the needs of their homes.  \r\n\r\nShe never stops caring for her children in spite of the hard work she does during the day.  This is her eighth loan with Microfinanzas Prisma.  It helps her to know that her responsibility within her group isn't only making her payments, but also the friendship and solidarity that the members have.  It isn't easy to interact and to learn how to work in a team.  The amount she is requesting will go towards acquiring another stand in the market and to increase her amount of products and capital.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Tanya Harper, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":309394,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To purchase another stand in the market","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-04-26T02:50:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":650,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Francisca","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-04-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":650}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":108.33,"local_amount":333.33,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T01:02:48Z","rounded_local_amount":336.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44596127},{"amount":112.66,"local_amount":346.66,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:45:30Z","rounded_local_amount":349.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52990394},{"amount":116.5,"local_amount":358.46,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:46:57Z","rounded_local_amount":361.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63211516},{"amount":122.38,"local_amount":376.54,"processed_date":"2009-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:28:58Z","rounded_local_amount":379.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73641023},{"amount":126.75,"local_amount":390.01,"processed_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:43:33Z","rounded_local_amount":393.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87080482},{"amount":63.38,"local_amount":195,"processed_date":"2009-10-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:10:38Z","rounded_local_amount":196.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96996641}],"funded_date":"2009-04-26T04:39:38Z","paid_date":"2009-11-16T03:10:43Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tanya Harper","image":783083}},{"id":108523,"name":"Yataka Moyo Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Fatma has been a bites (bread-like rolls) seller in the Mikunguni neighborhood of Zanzibar for ten years.

Jhonny serves as a security policeman in a super market in the western zone of Cochabamba city.  According to the owner of the super market, Jhonny is a very trustworthy, responsible, and hard-working person who complies with all the norms of the enterprise.\r\n\r\nJhonny lives in the Cero Verde zone of Cochabamba in a rental house.  After several years of saving money he was able to buy a house lot in the Huallani zone, located in the Eastern sector of Cochabamba.  But they lacked the funds to be able to construct their house.\r\n\r\nFor this reason the loan will be used to construct a house, enabling them to move and avoid paying rent.  This will fulfill their dream of having their own home and a place where their children can feel comfortable. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Harold Sims, Kiva

Lo que m\u00e1s le gusta de su trabajo es sembrar sus tierras y ver como sus cultivos van creciendo, lleva 5 a\u00f1os realizando esta actividad y considera que lo m\u00e1s dif\u00edcil es cuidar sus campos agr\u00edcolas de los cultivos. Con el tiempo, espera comprar m\u00e1s tierras y as\u00ed ampliar la cantidad de su producci\u00f3n. Este es el octavo cr\u00e9dito con MFP, en su primer cr\u00e9dito fue muy puntual con el pago de sus cuotas y espera serlo ahora tambi\u00e9n. En su grupo comunal es una social muy alegre, motivo por el cual es muy querida por el resto de sus compa\u00f1eras. Con los tres mil nuevos soles que solicita, comprar\u00e1 m\u00e1s abono para mejorar sus cultivos.\n\n","en":"Dolores, who is 31 years old, is a simple and hard working mother.  She lives in her parents' house with her 29 year old husband, Joel, and their 2 beloved children, to whom they want to give a better quality of life.  The arduous work days that Dolores has spent on her small farm have served to improve her crop and make her land more productive.  She works together with her older daughter starting very early in the morning.  They cultivate potatoes and beans, products that she will later bring to the wholesale market in the city of Tarma to sell.  What she likes best about her work is sowing her land and seeing her crops grow.  She has been in this business for 5 years and feels that the most difficult part is taking care of the crops on her farmland. With time, she hopes to purchase more land and increase her production quantity.  This is her eighth loan with MFP.  She was very timely in the repayment of her first loan, and she expects to be so now as well.  She is a very happy member of her communal bank, which is why she is well liked by the rest of the members.  With the 3000 PEN ($1075 USD) that she is requesting, she will purchase more fertilizer to improve her crops.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Marni Siegal, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":578444,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To purhcase more sacks of fertilizer.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-08-04T03:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1075,"lender_count":38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Dolores ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-07-05T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":1075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":3000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1075}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":1075,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:42:35Z","rounded_local_amount":3030.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211269247}],"funded_date":"2010-08-08T19:52:49Z","paid_date":"2011-06-15T11:42:35Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Marni Siegal","image":829283}},{"id":224091,"name":"Phoeun","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mr. Phoeun K., age 34 (pictured here) and his wife, Mrs. Nang Un, age 31, are vegetable farmers.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to epic mountain passes, a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC, and communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still lives in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Mary is an enterprising business woman who has been running her business for the past 6 years. The food items she sells are highly-favored staple foods on most food markets and at homes in Ntungamo and most parts of Western Uganda.\r\n\r\nMary is an exception to the rule. Notwithstanding the fact that she is divorced, she has showed fortitude in the face of hardship. It is a trait which is a rarity in most Ugandan women. She says that the odds were stacked against her but due to her strong resolve, she was not fazed. Her approach was to work assiduously to better her own welfare and that of her family. The entry into her business, just like any other business, was formidable but she remained firm in the face of the hurdles she encountered.\r\n\r\nIn many ways, affirmative action programs have been invaluable to her, just like they have been to many women entrepreneurs all across Uganda. Farming is the second string to her bow and, needless to say, her farms provide all the food items she sells after harvesting.\r\nMary says that her monthly sales income totals up to Uganda shillings 800,000.

to Fernando\u2019s Bar!! Fernando is 56 years old and is originally from Xilembene, in the Gaza Province. He is single and father of 2 daughters (25 years old and 11 years old) who live in South Africa with an uncle, as their mother died a couple of years ago. <P>\r\n\r\nFernando lived in the capital Maputo most of his life, completing primary school and working as a government employee for the FRELIMO Political Party. When he retired 3 years ago, he decided to open a bar in Ponta D\u2019Ouro, a beach village on the border with South Africa, very famous for its tourism, especially among South Africans. <P>\r\n\r\nThe bar is located near the village\u2019s central open-air market and serves only Mozambican national brands. A glass of beer costs MTn 50 (US$ 2) and a bottle of rum, his most-sold product, costs MTn 150 (US$ 6). Fernando loves his bar and to serve clients. He has become quite close to some of them, and together they recently started to sell T-shirts and hats with Fernando\u2019s brand name (\u201cFernando\u2019s Bar \u2013 Ponta D\u2019Ouro\u201d). These customers produce the clothing in South Africa and bring it to Ponta for him to sell at the bar; the profit is split 50\/50. A T-shirt is sold for MTn 350 (US$ 14) and hats go for for MTn 50 (US$ 2). With the bar, Fernando makes from MTn 50,000 (about US$ 2000) up to MTn 200,000  (US$ 8200) per month, depending on the season and South African holidays, and with the sale of clothes he is making up to MTn 100,000 (US$ 4100) per month, and he is incredibly satisfied about it. <P>\r\n\r\nOn top of supporting his daughters, Fernando also helps 3 sisters and his mother who live in Zipeto, near Maputo. He goes to Maputo around once a month to buy inventory for his bar and spends around MTn 5,000 (US$ 200) in food for his family (in total around 15 people). As he doesn\u2019t have a car, he goes with the minibus and pays MTn 300 (US$ 12.50) for  the round-trip ticket. <P>\r\n\r\nHluvuku is part of Fernando\u2019s life. He has already had 5 loans that he used in the bar (for expansion and increase of inventory), the first one in August 2005 of MTn 6,000 (US$ 250). This sixth loan of MTn 30,000 (US$ 1200) will also be used to increase inventory and prepare for South African holidays in April. In the future, Fernando plans ask for a leasing loan to buy a good car to help him buy merchandise and sell his signature clothing at close beaches. He also dreams of building a small house in Ponta (he currently lives in the back of the bar) and a kitchen in the bar to sell food to his clients. With his motivation, charisma and will to grow his business, he is definitely going to succeed in life."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":145348,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pub","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Increase

Elizabeth R. is 33 years old and from Mwanza. She is married with three children, who are between the ages of 4 and 16.

She purchases vitambaa (material), vitenge (a traditional Tanzanian cloth with wax print), and kanga (printed cotton fabric often with a border along all four sides) and makes them into clothing, primarily for women. She has been running this business since 2006. She works at the business for eight hours per day, six days per week. Elizabeth currently earns about $100 USD a month from her business. She is requesting a loan of $400 USD in order to buy one tailoring machine, and more materials for making clothes. In the future, she plans to open another store. Elizabeth thanks you for your support!\r\n<p>\r\nABOUT SELFINA:\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":255997,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Tailoring","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"To buy one tailoring machine, and materials for making clothes.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mwanza","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.516667 32.9","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-02-01T08:00:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elizabeth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-29T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-04-29T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-05-29T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:04:44Z","rounded_local_amount":50437.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20436410},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-03-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:57:36Z","rounded_local_amount":50437.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130682},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-04-29T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:26:56Z","rounded_local_amount":50437.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027479},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-05-29T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:15:29Z","rounded_local_amount":50437.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613480},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-06-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:03:09Z","rounded_local_amount":50437.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010559},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-07-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:39:51Z","rounded_local_amount":50437.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63232854},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-08-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:53:43Z","rounded_local_amount":50437.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73664658},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-09-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T02:47:41Z","rounded_local_amount":50437.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87105389},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-10-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T06:28:23Z","rounded_local_amount":50437.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97022534},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-11-25T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:42:21Z","rounded_local_amount":50437.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103867783}],"funded_date":"2009-02-01T14:39:32Z","paid_date":"2009-12-15T14:42:21Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Susan Napier","image":null}},{"id":88059,"name":"Ny\u00e8taa Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Le groupe Ny\u00e8taa est compos\u00e9 de huit (08)  femmes,  toutes mari\u00e9es  qui ont un \u00e2ge moyen de 32 ans et 5 enfants.

Millets is obtained from their daily work during harvest season in the men's fields, as well as at the weekly fair at the grand market in S\u00e9gou.

Because of her separation, she became responsible for taking care of her home.  Thanks to the support she gets from her parents, she can provide for her children.  \r\n\r\nShe has always liked to be well kept, and she was interested in studying cosmetology.  She learned not only how to cut hair, but she also learned how to give cleansing treatments, massages, and different skin treatments.  Since her parents provided a place in their home, she opened a beauty salon two years ago.  Every day she offers better service to her customers who loyally visit every month.  \r\n\r\nGladys wants to put a Spa on the premises.  To do that, she needs to set up and expand her space to offer diverse beauty services.  But, she cannot do that due to lack of funds.  To that end, she works in the beauty salon every day from nine in the morning until six in the evening.  She tries to rest early so that she can see to her daughter who needs her attention.  \r\n\r\nGladys is asking for an individual credit from MFP.

Camba-og, Hinigaran Negros Occidental. Analyn is 34 years old.  She is married to Jose Hernal, who presently operates a Tangkop business, which is a kind of fishing using a fish trap in deeper water just off the shoreline. Food is placed inside the trap to attract the fish, crabs and shrimp. After an hour, whatever is in the center of the maze-like cage is harvested. The couple has 3 children who are 12 to 17 years old. \n\nBased on experience,  Analyn knew that she could not rely on her husband's income from the Tangkop or fish trap because it is seasonal and the catch can sometimes be erratic. During stormy weather, her husband could not go to his fish trap and collect the catch. This is the reason why Analyn joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2002 - to be able to borrow money to add to her capital and start a general store which could provide her family with a more steady daily income. \n\nBecause of Analyn's regular income from her business, she could send their children to school and also provide for the daily household expenses. She earns an average monthly income of PHP 7,000 from her general store. Having her own income has gone a long way in improving the quality of life of the M. family.\n\nAnalyn's credit history with Kiva's partner NWTF-Project Dungganon has been good. She always pays her dues on time and completely pays off her loan within the loan term. Her last loan, which was her 12th from NWTF-PD -- amounting to PHP 17,000 -- was invested in her general store. She industriously paid her weekly installments.  Now that she has paid it off, she is borrowing her next cycle loan of PHP 19,000 to fix her husband's fish trap so that he can continue with his fishing business. \n\nThey intend to use the profits from this loan to start a rice retailing business to further increase their income and save up for their children's college education. \n\nAnalyn is shown here in front of her General Store as it is quite difficult to photograph her in the middle of the sea where her husband's Tangkop or fish trap is located.\n \nAbout NWTF: \n\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the calling of not just of a few but thousands of women. Through the alleviation program, these women have progressed from earning less than a measly $1 a day, to surpassing realities beyond their dreams. They have learned to live a life where they can finally be called honorable. This is Project Dungganon. \n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":396031,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fishing","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Maintenance of Tangkop (fish cage)","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Hinigaran, Negros Occidental","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":145,"posted_date":"2009-10-03T09:17:14Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Analyn","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-09-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":19000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":760},{"due_date":"2009-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":760},{"due_date":"2009-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":760},{"due_date":"2009-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":760},{"due_date":"2009-11-02T08:00:00Z","amount":760},{"due_date":"2009-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":760},{"due_date":"2009-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":760},{"due_date":"2009-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":760},{"due_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":760},{"due_date":"2009-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":760},{"due_date":"2009-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":760},{"due_date":"2009-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":760},{"due_date":"2009-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":760},{"due_date":"2010-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":760},{"due_date":"2010-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":760},{"due_date":"2010-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":760},{"due_date":"2010-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":760},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":760},{"due_date":"2010-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":760},{"due_date":"2010-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":760},{"due_date":"2010-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":760},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":760},{"due_date":"2010-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":760},{"due_date":"2010-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":760},{"due_date":"2010-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":760}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":85,"local_amount":3800,"processed_date":"2009-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T04:08:18Z","rounded_local_amount":4030.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97004163},{"amount":68,"local_amount":3040,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:08:30Z","rounded_local_amount":3224.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103848934},{"amount":68,"local_amount":3040,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T16:01:46Z","rounded_local_amount":3224.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110739602},{"amount":68,"local_amount":3040,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:15:04Z","rounded_local_amount":3224.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118129028},{"amount":68,"local_amount":3040,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:53:52Z","rounded_local_amount":3224.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123965825},{"amount":68,"local_amount":3040,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:37:50Z","rounded_local_amount":3224.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128997739}],"funded_date":"2009-10-03T15:49:56Z","paid_date":"2010-04-15T09:37:50Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":145499,"name":"Hadija","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Hadija runs a provisions kiosk in the market square.

She is a committed LAPO client. She sells yams and has been in the business for five years. The profit from this trade enables her to support her husband, who is a motor repairman, in providing for the needs of the family.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Unidas<\/i> which translates as \"The Women\u00b4s Bank of United Hands\". The nine women members live in the rural area of Pococ\u00ed, Lim\u00f3n, located near the Caribbean coast of Costa Rica. Opportunities for employment are scarce in Pococ\u00ed; many families rely on the production of subsistence crops and raising livestock in order to maintain their standard of living. The members of this group are involved in various productive activities including hen rearing for the production and sale of eggs, chicken rearing in order to produce quality poultry products and pig rearing in order to produce pork products. This loan will be used by each individual member to make necessary investments for the growth of their businesses to increase revenues and for the improvement of the lives of their families. The majority of this loan will be put towards the purchase of livestock and animal feed.\r\n\r\nFlor E. R. is a 39-year-old mother of four and the elected president of <i>Banco Mujer Manos Unidas<\/i>. She lives with her husband and three of her children. One of her daughters is studying Business Administration at the National University in Sarapiqui. She has one and a half years left until graduation. \r\n\r\nOn their land, Flor and her family have planted subsistence crops including rice, beans, corn and plantains, among others. At the moment, Flor is raising 20 chickens, one pig to be slaughtered and sold, and 30 hens whose eggs will later be sold. She plans to invest this loan in the purchase of 40 more hens as well as nutrients and vitamins to feed them.  Flor will be able to use family-produced corn to feed her chickens, but she will need to buy special vitamins to fight off dangerous parasites which could infect the animals. Her main challenges are coping with the high costs of animal vitamins and the occasional electricity problems at home, due to the fact that Flor and her family live in a rural area, 600 meters from the nearest road. \r\n\r\nAt the moment, Flor is altering her production methods in order to produce 100% organically. This method of production is favourable to Flor because she \"wants to provide a higher quality product and [she] is more comfortable eating food when [she] is conscious of the composition of all the nutrients used in its production\" (meat products, crops, fertilizers and gas). Her main goal is to increase organic production on her land and to become independently sustainable, meaning she would like to use only home grown products in production. She would also like to install a biodigester (equipment used to harness animal discharge in order to produce gas for cooking). This equipment is sometimes donated to farmers by the Costa Rican government. \r\n\r\nFlor has known the other members of her group for 8 years. She says that applying for a loan in a group is better because the women can help each other to succeed in their businesses and repay their loans. \r\n\r\nZelmira F. plans to use this loan to buy chicks and nutrients to feed them. When the chicks are ready, she will sell them and their eggs to neighbours and acquaintances in the community. Zelmira sells 12 eggs for 1000 colones (roughly $2 US). She mentions the importance of maintaining the good health of her animals in order to ensure a quality end product.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3250,"image":{"id":520300,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Underfunded

Cruz, Benito Soliven. She is 30 years old. Carolyn is married and has 1 infant child. To make a living, Carolyn owns and operates a business venture in the agriculture sector, raising livestock. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from raising pigs for fattening and sale. Carolyn has been engaged in her business for over 3 years and earns approximately 3,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Carolyn joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Carolyn has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase baby livestock to raise and sell in the future. Carolyn is requesting a loan of 7,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase baby livestock to raise and sell in future. This loan will be the 3rd loan taken out by Carolyn from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to financially support immediate members of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 29 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists, and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She has been in this business for four years, since her husband became unemployed and they came to Cartagena with her mother and a little bit of capital.\r\n\r\nThey started living on the income from her business preparing this food, with the support of a small pension of her mom's.  Zaida tells us that her business has done very well and her household income has increased.  Her husband helps her and also travels to sell goods.  For this reason, he is often absent for long periods of time and during these times her business supports the household.  Zaida's business activity has been important for all of them because she has managed to get together enough money for a down payment on a house.

This water is easily contaminated with bacteria that can cause water-borne diseases. If Bogesia A community had a way to treat their drinking water, it could reduce the cases of water-borne diseases, keeping Bogesia A community at school and work.\n\nThis is why Susan is requesting a loan for a chlorine dispenser on behalf of  community. Susan was elected to represent her community as a volunteer promoter. She is not only representing her community on Kiva, but also volunteers her time to educate the people of her community on the importance of safe water and how to use the chlorine dispenser when they come to fetch water at their local water point. The loan will be used for the installation of the dispensers and the initial supplies of chlorine. Susan wants to be a promoter because she envisions a community free of water-borne diseases.\n\nThe Kiva loan will be repaid by Evidence Action (www.evidenceaction.org) on behalf of the community, through the sale of carbon credits. Using the chlorine dispenser generates carbon credits by avoiding the need to boil water to make it safe to drink. Revenues from the sale of carbon credits to organizations and individuals wanting to reduce their carbon footprint will be used to repay Kiva lenders and also to make sure that Susan\u2019s community can have access to safe water now and in the future.\n"}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1806236,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Health","sector":"Health","themes":["Innovative Loans","Water and Sanitation"],"use":"To reduce the burden of water-borne diseases by providing access to safe drinking water via chlorine dispensers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kuria East","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":324,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2250,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Susan ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Enock ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rahab ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Samuel ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jane ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-01-28T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":2250,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":72,"loan_amount":2250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2018-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":562.5},{"due_date":"2019-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":562.5},{"due_date":"2020-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":750}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2019-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":562.5},{"due_date":"2020-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":562.5},{"due_date":"2021-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":750}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":872390,"name":"Boniface","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Boniface is 45 years old.

She comes from Gulu district in the northern part of Uganda. Currently she is living in one of the residential areas located in Kampala known as Nakawa Quarters. She is 30 years old, and she currently is totally responsible for her children without any assistance.\r\n<br><br>\r\nHelen left Gulu because she felt the North was unsafe due to the war, and she also needed to search for some kind of work so that her family could survive. It was not easy finding work in Kampala, so Helen started a small business. She would cook food and then take it to busy places and sell it. That was how she found Life in Africa: she came to us to sell her meals. She soon became a member and is now employed in the bracelet-making project. She has proved herself to be an understanding and patient person with great interpersonal skills.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nHelen is very active and committed to the activities that LIA offers at our center. Over time, through Helen\u2019s job at LIA, she was able to save some money that enabled her to start a small charcoal business in her effort to set up a side income to sustain herself and her family. She has proved to have a good head for business and has developed a solid customer base. She now plans to expand this business. <P>Currently Helen\u2019s charcoal stall is located in her residential area and it\u2019s being managed by one of her family members. They share the stall, each selling their own goods, and they take turns at working the stall.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nHelen has now entered into a partnership with another dealer to travel up-country to buy charcoal at a lower price. They will split the transport costs which will allow each to make a greater profit.\r\nShe has managed to save 150,000 Uganda shillings (US$ 90) and she is requesting a loan in the amount of 200,000 Uganda shillings to finance the expansion. Helen plans to reinvest the profits so that her business can continue to grow. With her good reputation and solid customer base she is very confident that her business will succeed and her family will benefit greatly.

Victoria has a small store where she sells food staples such as flour, sugar, and beans. She also sells fruits and vegetables.\r\n<p>\r\nLucila is 37 years old.  She is married and has two children.  Lucila sells a variety of drinks from a store located at her in-law\u2019s house.

His dream is to establish six manzanas (about 10 acres) of pineapples, in order that he can leave an equal inheritance to each of children, who like him have worked hard to maintain production.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Katy Long, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":229272,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farm Supplies","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Purchase materials such as pesticide and fertilizer to improve crops","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Managua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.150833 -86.268333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":98,"posted_date":"2008-11-24T13:10:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":625,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jose Manuel ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-11-14T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":12000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":12000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":625}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":29.45,"local_amount":565.53,"processed_date":"2008-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-15T18:25:39Z","rounded_local_amount":583.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5281522},{"amount":595.55,"local_amount":11434.47,"processed_date":"2009-07-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T09:34:19Z","rounded_local_amount":11791.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63111665}],"funded_date":"2008-12-10T20:17:12Z","paid_date":"2009-08-15T09:34:19Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"katy long","image":null}},{"id":79883,"name":"Dilafruz","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Vegetable farming is a traditional occupation in northern Tajikistan, especially in Dilafruz\u2019s village. Having a fairly large amount of land surrounding her house, this mother of four decided to try growing vegetables. Neither she nor her husband has been able to find steady employment, and she has been observing the success of her relatives and neighbors who sell vegetables at the market. She has experience growing and selling produce and wants to now do so more intensively to generate more income for her family. She has many ideas about how to be competitive by growing the right crops in a certain way, and she is sure that she will do well. She is requesting a loan to purchase mineral fertilizer and seeds so she can grow her business. Dilafruz sincerely thanks you for your generous heart. \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road, the end of Alexander the Great's rule, and the birthplace of the great Persian poet Rudaki and the most famous Islamic philosopher Ibn Sina (Avicenna). The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, and Central Asian traditions. But Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She began the business out of necessity for work to support her sons and to pay different debts.  In the beginning she had a stable job but due to her situation she had to leave it.  It was then that she decided to search for a new mode of income and it was by her own initiative that she decided to establish her store.  She began with few products such as soap and candies.

He is a very hardworking man. He is married to Alicia, who is 28, and they have 3 children. They all live together in their own home, located in the Roca community, in Quimbiri. Ciro is the breadwinner for his family; since childhood his parents raised him to work on the farm. He is a farmer, and has worked his own lands for 16 years, growing coffee and coca leaf, which are plants native to the Apurimac River valley.\r\n\r\nDuring the harvest season, help from day laborers is necessary, as they quickly pick the beans and coca leaves. What he enjoys most about his work is harvesting, as he feels the months of hard work are reflected in the quality of the fruits.  The most difficult part is transporting his goods from the farm to the collection centers, which are located in San Francisco. Here the best prices are offered for his products. In the future, he would like to purchase more land in order to increase cultivation and grow cacao and banana. \r\n\r\nThis is his first loan with MFP. He believes this contribution will help him greatly with his business. He is grateful to the Institucion Prisma for extending this credit to him. With the money requested, he will contract day laborers for clearing weeds, and purchase coffee seeds for planting.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":712719,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Purchase

She is married with 4 children. For the past nine years, she has operated a health store which sells vitamins and health care items.\r\nGroup Loan Disbursement meetings are always interesting. One has to have patience. We arrived in Katwe, a slum area on the outskirts of Kampala around 3:00PM. Most disbursements occur in the afternoon because the chairperson and treasury have to go to the bank, collect the money, and return to their village. Sometimes even lines at banks can be a couple of hours. Once they have returned to the village, someone is sent out to tell all the members that it is time to meet. \r\n<p>\r\nWe arrived at the meeting place, a simple concrete home in Katwe. Most homes are adobe. Removing our shoes, we entered through the draped doorway. We took our seat on a comfortable but worn sofa and waited. Over the next two hours, people arrived and took a place on the floor. We waited for all to arrive. As people came through the draped doorway into the darkened room, they would greet us with \u201cYou are most welcome\u201d and then take their place in the room. By the time all had arrived, there were 28 persons in a 12ft. by 12ft. room lit only by the light of the doorway. There is a peaceful calm in groups. Ugandans rarely raise their voices.

(A \u201ctanda\u201d is when a group agrees that each member will contribute a quantity of money weekly, biweekly or monthly, and then that sum is distributed to a group member.
