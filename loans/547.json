Suyono has a food stall business that sells meatballs, chicken soup called \u201csoto\u201d and \u201cgado-gado\u201d (a kind of salad eaten with peanut sauce). This business was inherited from his father. It has been running for 11 years. Suyono is married to Desi and blessed with a daughter: Putri, who is 8 years old and in the second grade of elementary school.\r\n\r\nThe challenge for Suyono in running the food stall business is the increasing price of meat in the market. With the capital that he currently has, the quantity of meat that he is able to buy is lower. In order to generate more income, Suyono is thinking to improve his business by selling fruit ice, but unfortunately Suyono does not have enough capital to do so. \r\n\r\nHe learned that TLM would like to help entrepreneurs like him.  He is applying for a loan of IDR 4,500,000 from TLM to purchase a refrigerator to store the fruit, a blender and some wood to create a small table. Suyono hopes TLM will approve his loan application to improve his business.

He is a role model, a mentor, and an inspiration to many young farmers in his village because of his resilience despite personal challenges and his passion to support his parents and siblings as a primary source of income. The living conditions in the Endebes, Kitale area are very tough and one needs to have tough skin in order to survive. Paul has always shown the resilience to beat all odds. \n\nBecause of the hardcore poverty in his village, Paul started practicing mixed farming and has been doing it for the past 3 years. Paul's sources of income are from producing vegetables, maize, and eggs. These products are very perishable and require timely delivery to the market, which is a problem for Paul. The Endebes area has a poor road network and poor feeder roads that really hamper timely delivery of products to the market. \n\nPaul with great humility is kindly seeking a loan to buy a motorbike. With the motorbike he will deliver products to the market on time and reap more profits because the products will still be fresh. Paul is very determined to succeed, and because he is much disciplined with finances, he plans to accumulate profits to provide a secure future for himself and for his parents and siblings. Paul's dream is to provide a secure future for his siblings.

This is 27-year-old Haika C. from Mbeya. She is married with 3 children, between the ages of 3 and 9. Haika has been running a business selling phone accessories since 2005.<p>\r\n\r\nDespite being a \u2018developing\u2019 country (forgive the label, there remains no consensus on an acceptable definition), it is amazing how many people have mobile phones in Tanzania and in Africa in general. Not just professionals, but grandmas in villages, school kids, street sellers. It can probably be attributed to a number of factors, led by the fact that it is the only form of phone communication available to most people because there are few landlines, and followed closely by how relatively cheap mobile phones are here.<p>\r\n\r\nShe works at the business for 12 hours per day, 7 days per week. Haika currently earns about $60 USD a month from her business. She is requesting a loan of $475 USD in order to increase stock of phone accessories. In the future, she plans to increase phone accessories and varieties of phones in her business.

She lives with her two children, who are ages 10 and 4 and who study at the elementary school, and her mother who is 70 years old. Reina works making and selling tortillas, which she sells Monday through Sunday, more around midday than in the afternoons. Her mother helps her so she is able to work more efficiently in order for her to be able to help the many customers who fill her business, especially during peak hours. This business has been a great help for Reina and her whole family. She is requesting this loan in order to buy a larger quantity of corn and, also, to buy cans of propane gas to be able to keep some in storage for occasions during the year when gas is running short which can be detrimental for her business.

This business, although it has not produced many profits because of nearby supermarkets and street markets, has enabled her to live, covering her basic necessities (food and bills).  She lives with her husband.  With this loan, she will purchase merchandise, since, due to the recent earthquake of February 27 of this year, Mercedes lost 90% of her merchandise because of a small collapse of one wall in her house.  She suffers constant pain in one of her legs because of varicose veins, but she has been able to keep herself going by keeping up with her business, including her dream to have a small bakery.  Loans have very much helped Mercedes to get ahead in her business.  She also very much enjoys the relationships among her fellow group members, the good treatment from her consultant, and classes about how to correctly help clients.  \r\n<br>\r\nLinares is an important urban center in the Maule region, located in the central region of the country.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from operating \"tricycle\" (three-wheeled) transport services. Benedicta is just starting this business.\r\n\r\nIn 2011, Benedicta joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Benedicta is requesting a loan of 10,000 PHP which will be used to purchase tires and other accessories. This will be the first loan taken out by Benedicta from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has seven branches covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Each day she rises very early to prepare the stuffed potatoes, which leaves her little time to attend to her children as the preparation is more work over time.  Since she kept having more children and it become difficult to care for them and work, her husband found a job in construction and she decided to change and sell \"salchi-papas\" (a fried sausage and potatoe snack) which she sells from Monday to Friday from 5pm until 9:30pm and Saturdays she works cleaning houses, while attending to her children in the afternoon.\r\n\r\nWith FINCA Carolina's business has changed and she has learned to save.  She buys ingredients wholesale so that she can earn more.  She does not like to pay if other members lack resources, but she knows the rules of the village bank.  She needs an 800 soles loan to buy oil and potatoes as ingredients for the preparation of the salchi-papas.\r\n\r\nCarolina dreams of finishing the construction of her home and putting in a small grocery store.  She has made a goal to achieve this in two years and with the help of her family and hard work, hopes to do so.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Daniel Kahn, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":257068,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Purchase of oil and potatoes as indgredients","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":70,"posted_date":"2009-01-17T03:50:13Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":275,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Carolina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-13T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":800,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2009-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2009-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2009-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":200}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":68.75,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2009-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T08:28:35Z","rounded_local_amount":217.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20397259},{"amount":68.75,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2009-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T18:17:17Z","rounded_local_amount":217.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27088963},{"amount":137.5,"local_amount":400,"processed_date":"2009-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T16:12:09Z","rounded_local_amount":435.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35982299}],"funded_date":"2009-01-17T05:12:14Z","paid_date":"2009-05-15T16:12:09Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Daniel Kahn","image":986682}},{"id":88511,"name":"Tith","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mr. Tith K. lives in the Thlos village in Takeo province.

With this loan, they would like to buy raw materials, such as brightly colored fabrics, buttons, zippers, thread, embroidering materials, yarn, etc. to make a variety of pretty dresses, which they hope to sell more of this Christmas. \r\n\r\nThey would like to thank the institution for the support it has provided with this loan, which has benefited their workshop greatly, helping it grow in sales and become a bigger attraction to new clients. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Violeta Rubiani, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":449433,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"Buying raw materials to make dresses","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Managua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.150833 -86.268333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":98,"posted_date":"2009-12-15T22:40:18Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Daisy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-12-11T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":8000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2010-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2010-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2010-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2010-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2010-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2010-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2010-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":51.24,"local_amount":1024.75,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T09:52:20Z","rounded_local_amount":1065.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118003335},{"amount":49.96,"local_amount":999.29,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T07:53:28Z","rounded_local_amount":1038.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123841502},{"amount":50.79,"local_amount":1015.84,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T07:49:35Z","rounded_local_amount":1056.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128874424},{"amount":49.91,"local_amount":998.23,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T09:30:19Z","rounded_local_amount":1037.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136604303},{"amount":51.2,"local_amount":1024.09,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T08:31:19Z","rounded_local_amount":1064.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144639767},{"amount":46.9,"local_amount":937.8,"processed_date":"2010-06-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:00:11Z","rounded_local_amount":974.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151821551},{"amount":53.73,"local_amount":1074.54,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T09:03:53Z","rounded_local_amount":1117.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159561559},{"amount":46.27,"local_amount":925.46,"processed_date":"2010-08-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T09:17:22Z","rounded_local_amount":962.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166770495}],"funded_date":"2009-12-16T00:35:03Z","paid_date":"2010-09-15T09:17:22Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Violeta Rubiani","image":null}},{"id":166620,"name":"Sakina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sakina is thirty-nine years old.

Her husband is a pensioner and her elder son is currently a guest worker in Russia, usually sending about 250 dollars monthly.\r\n\r\nMisirat\u2019s family deals in livestock. They have three milk cows, one horse and a few sheep and also produce milk and milk products such as yogurt, sour cream and kefir (a fermented milk drink). For this loan she is planning to buy a milk cow. In the future she hopes to increase the number of her milk cows and produce enough milk to have supply agreements with kindergartens.\r\n\r\nMahpuba, 51, is married and has four children: three daughters and one son. Her elder two daughters are working in Russia as salespersons and her husband works in a tobacco plant as crew chief. She is asking for the loan to buy a milk cow. \r\n\r\nJanysh is the youngest member of this group. He is just 26 years old and is married with one little daughter. His wife is a member of a farming collective. Janysh lives with his parents, but he hopes in near future to buy proper land and build his own house.

She regularly attends their weekly fellowship meetings and pays her weekly dues consistently.

She is consistent in paying her dues because she used the money she borrowed to expand and improve her businesses.     \r\n\r\nTo ensure the success of her business, she would like to apply for a 10,000 Philippine peso loan.

Hanadi's husband, Ahmed, runs an electronics accessories store selling items such as batteries, electric machines cords, etc. Hanadi's husband needs to improve the store, adding shelves and showing windows as well as purchasing more goods to sell and increase his returns.\n\nHanadi is a housewife and helps her husband by working in the store. The store serves a good number of clients, and selling more goods will be helpful to improve it and have better income.\n\nHanadi's husband appears here in the picture as Hanadi is not comfortable having her picture online since she comes from a conservative background.\n\nImportant information about this loan:\n\nFATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan. For more information on lending in the Muslim world, please visit our FAQs."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1550,"image":{"id":633412,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Electronics

It is the fourth time that this group has requested financial aid from Alid\u00e9 so that they can increase their business volume. Alphonsine is 60 years old and married to an accountant called Godens. The couple has three children, all educated, one of whom remains a dependent. Alphonsine lives with her husband and dependent child. She covers the various family expenses together with her husband. She did not attend school and now has an activity selling various groceries (corn, bread) as well as clothing, in her neighborhood; this allows her to provide for her family's needs, as well as her own, without any difficulty. Alphonsine has been carrying out this business for the past seven years. She gets her supplies in Benin. With a view to responding better to customer demand, she would like to increase her stock. In order to do this, Alphonsine is requesting a fourth loan from Alid\u00e9 together with the other members of the Alodononzo group. The first three loans have all been fully repaid.

Especially remarkable are Senegal\u2019s networks of rotating savings and credit associations, known as tontines. Commonly organized by groups of twenty to thirty housewives who live in the same village, the tontines provide poor women throughout the country with small loans to finance modest income-generating activities. Repayment rates within these associations are excellent, because they are based on local reputation and personal trust between the members. However, their financial resources are limited to the contributions of their members, frequently subsistence farmers with very little disposable income. This has prevented the traditional tontines from meeting the demand for rural microenterprise loans and restricted their impact on the economic development of their communities. Senegal Ecovillage Microfinance (SEM) works to bridge this gap by linking traditional village credit associations with outside sources of finance.

This is why Vida has asked for a loan to invest and increase her working capital so that she can continue with her business and survive with her family who are always making efforts to improve their financial situation.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Laure Kwon, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":257124,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Games","sector":"Entertainment","themes":null,"use":"Working capital","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Leon","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.435556 -86.879444","type":"point"}},"partner_id":96,"posted_date":"2009-01-17T18:00:18Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":450,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Vida Luz ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-14T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":8500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":772.73},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":772.73},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":772.73},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":772.73},{"due_date":"2009-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":772.73},{"due_date":"2009-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":772.73},{"due_date":"2009-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":772.73},{"due_date":"2009-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":772.73},{"due_date":"2009-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":772.73},{"due_date":"2009-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":772.73},{"due_date":"2009-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":772.7}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":40.91},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":40.91},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.91},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.91},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.91},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.91},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.91},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.91},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.91},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.91},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.9}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":40.91,"local_amount":772.73,"processed_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T08:41:04Z","rounded_local_amount":816.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20399987},{"amount":40.91,"local_amount":772.73,"processed_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T18:35:52Z","rounded_local_amount":816.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27091985},{"amount":40.9,"local_amount":772.73,"processed_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T16:38:18Z","rounded_local_amount":816.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35985369},{"amount":40.91,"local_amount":772.73,"processed_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T23:09:26Z","rounded_local_amount":816.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44445985},{"amount":40.91,"local_amount":772.73,"processed_date":"2009-06-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T20:39:32Z","rounded_local_amount":816.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52956626},{"amount":245.46,"local_amount":4636.35,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T14:00:31Z","rounded_local_amount":4896.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63174053}],"funded_date":"2009-01-17T19:53:05Z","paid_date":"2009-08-15T14:00:31Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"L K","image":355766}},{"id":88527,"name":"Hilda","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"<p>Hilda C. is a 35-year-old mother and seaweed farmer.

It has produced famous thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. A civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged an already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural productivity and the manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent viable business prospects.

He lives in the community of Palestina Alta, located in the beautiful jungle of Cuzco where they have their own home.  For Cirilo, nothing in this life is impossible, his strength has raised him up to get ahead.  He is always involved in his work, always proving that \u201cthere is always something to do.\u201d  This has turned him into a perseverant person worthy of admiration.  Apart from growing cacao and coffee, he also works for other people doing farm work, earning money when he is not busy with his work.  In this way he is able to have additional income for his family.  Generally he works on his own from 7 in the morning until 6 in the evening but at times his family helps him.  Normally he sells his products in his community at market prices to help its economy.  His main hope is to increase his cacao and coffee plantings.  For this he needs to equip himself with more fields.  This will help increase his production and his earnings, with the goal of improving his quality of life.  This is his third loan with MFP which he is committed to pay on time and also wants to comply with his community bank because of the good path it is putting him on.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is married to Felipe, a cook in a food stall, and is the mother of five children. Four of her children are already working, while the youngest is in high school. By the grace of God, Andrea has managed to support her older children's schooling up to college level. At this time, she is working hard to send her youngest to college. This is a dream for most poor Filipino parents; Andrea herself has been an undergraduate, and she believes that a college diploma is the best inheritance parents can leave to their children.\r\n\r\nAndrea maintains a direct selling business. She sells clothing, footwear, undergarments, cosmetics, and other products through the popular direct selling brands like Avon, Fullerlife, Natasha, Boardwalk, Marikina Shoe Exchange, and other direct selling brands. A customer's order is bought in cash by the dealer and then given to the customer with a one-month-to-pay credit. Dealers' prices are lower than those in the catalogue, and these are the profits that dealers are investing on as their income. Aside from direct selling, she sells breakfast every morning. Her regular customers are her neighbours and the local community. She earns a minimum of Php 510 in sales every week.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a loan of Php 10,000. She will be using the loan to buy orders for her customers. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nAndrea fervently hopes that her child will be able to graduate one day.

When her husband disappeared she was left with only one form of income, a pension from the minister of education.  This money was not sufficient since her children study in a modest school in the city center.  Therefore Maria began to sell different market goods such as clothing which she brought from the capital city.  This business has yielded good result and she will continue selling.  Thanks to her efforts and skillful management of the funds that her work generates Maria was able to save up and purchase a motorcycle taxi which her son drives.

For 20 years he has been selling food, since cooking is one of his most outstanding skills.  He has always been very demanding about the quality of food, and with time he decided to specialize in becoming a chef.  Once he discovered his gifts in the kitchen, he opened a seafood restaurant in the southern beaches of his city.  In this place, tourists spend weekends at the sea, and are don Juan's most frequent customers.  But since he only works there on weekends, he put a little restaurant in his house which his wife takes care of, and he cooks there during the week.  Without a doubt, though, what he would like to do is get a bigger location so his restaurant becomes one of the most welcoming to foreigners, who are his most frequent customers and for whom he wants to provide the best service.<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\nThis will be Ju\u00e1n's fourth loan with MFP and he hopes to continue working together with the group that has taught him how to work as part of a team.

Her greatest monthly expenses include feeding the family and school fees for her children. Her major business challenges are transportation and seasonality, which makes her business difficult. Hajara has been in this business for four years and with MCDT for eight years. She has had 17 loans, working with the same group mates.

She is aiming for monthly profits of 120,000 CFA francs, which she will use to reimburse her loan and contribute to her family\u2019s daily needs, with the rest going towards continuing her business.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":740756,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"to purchase a variety of items for inventory","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Koutiala","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2011-04-01T19:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1075,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sali","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-03-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2011-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2011-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2011-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2012-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2012-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":179.17},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":179.16},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":179.17},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":179.17},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":179.16},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":179.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":179.17,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2011-05-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T12:00:21Z","rounded_local_amount":83564.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211301480},{"amount":179.16,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2011-07-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T09:30:24Z","rounded_local_amount":83564.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221750817},{"amount":179.17,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2011-09-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T10:13:27Z","rounded_local_amount":83564.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232881997},{"amount":179.17,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2011-11-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T11:12:30Z","rounded_local_amount":83564.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244655401},{"amount":179.16,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2012-01-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:48:14Z","rounded_local_amount":83564.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257283027},{"amount":179.17,"local_amount":83333.35,"processed_date":"2012-03-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-11T08:20:14Z","rounded_local_amount":83564.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270139765}],"funded_date":"2011-04-03T16:58:53Z","paid_date":"2012-05-11T08:20:14Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Chelsea Rosendale","image":754499}},{"id":290161,"name":"Lidia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"\nLidia R.

Gairat has worked for many years in the difficult business of raising cattle. He is an exemplary husband in that he always tries his hardest to provide food for his wife and two children in their home.\r\n\r\nAfter purchasing his cattle, Gairat provides them with all the right conditions for their growth: taking care of their food and protection and making sure they don\u2019t get lost. Once they\u2019re fully mature, Gairat sells them in his area and also provides their milk for sale. His wife (pictured) helps him with taking care of and feeding his animals.\r\n\r\nCurrently Gairat needs to purchase cattle to raise and for this reason is turning to IMON International to obtain a loan of 3,000 Somoni. He thanks Kiva for the support that it presents to small entrepreneurs. \r\n\r\n\r\n<b>More about Tajikistan and IMON International<\/b>\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

She lives with her elderly parents in the neighborhood of Purhuararca.  She is a modest person who has dedicated her entire life to helping her younger siblings, taking care of her nieces and nephews whom she loves very much.  But, like a good country woman, she farms for a living.  Together with her sister, she grows various kinds of animal feed, such as oats, alfalfa, and barley, which help her with her business buying and selling alfalfa.  Her experience has shown that this is the best quality feed and the most difficult to produce, since it needs a lot of care.  After buying different sown fields of feed, she markets her produce in the town of San Pedro de Cajas once a month.  Occasionally, she will also market in the neighborhood of Palcamayo.  Because she is aware of her economic needs, she also buys large quantities of sheep, which she fattens and resells at a higher price.  This provides her with extra money to use in case of emergency.  She belongs to the Productores de Purhuararca Communal Bank and this is her fourth loan with MFP, where she hopes for your support in order to continue to pursue her goals.  She promises to make her payments on time.
