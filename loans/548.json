Their families have worked in this industry for centuries. This artisan product has an important history and is in high demand in Nicaragua because of the variety of styles and colors making hammocks versatile, light, transportable, comfortable, economic, durable and pleasant to look at.\r\n\r\nThe coordinator of this group is se\u00f1ora Evangelina L. Gonzales who makes and sells the thick yarn which is used for making hammocks. At first, when the business was small, without available capital to invest, they didn't have enough products. Now, it has grown, and with the loan they are requesting they'll be able to offer more colors and thread. \r\n\r\nThe other members are Amalia V. and Ana S. who have been making hammocks for years. They say that at the beginning, running a business was hard since they didn't have the necessary resources, but today it has significantly improved. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Sierra Visher, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":511500,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Textiles","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"Colored thread","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Masaya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.966667 -86.1","type":"point"}},"partner_id":120,"posted_date":"2010-03-22T19:30:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":575,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Evangelina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Amalia Del Socorro ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ana Josefa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":12000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2010-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2010-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2010-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2010-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2010-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2010-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2010-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2010-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2010-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2010-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2010-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2010-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2010-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2010-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":750}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.94},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.94},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.93},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.94},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.94},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.94},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.93},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.94},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.94},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.94},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.93},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.94},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.94},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.94},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.93},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.94}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":32.84,"local_amount":685.39,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T07:48:29Z","rounded_local_amount":690.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128872745},{"amount":136.25,"local_amount":2843.41,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T09:29:06Z","rounded_local_amount":2865.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136602766},{"amount":179.07,"local_amount":3737.12,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T08:29:29Z","rounded_local_amount":3766.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144638125},{"amount":226.84,"local_amount":4734.08,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T08:59:19Z","rounded_local_amount":4771.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151819961}],"funded_date":"2010-03-22T23:46:29Z","paid_date":"2010-07-15T08:59:19Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sierra Visher","image":607386}},{"id":191446,"name":"Yang","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Yang P., 28, is a seamstress in a garment factory, while her husband, Mr. Thorng Sithoeun, shown at the right of the photo, is a construction foreman.

She sells taro, which she plants and harvests. Aufaatasi has 2 years of experience in this business.  Aufaatasi needs a loan of WST$2000 to purchase general farm supplies and equipment. She plans to use the earnings (estimated to be 400 talas or US $167 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Aufaatasi joined SPBD. This is her 3rd loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Aufaatasi's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.

She earns her living by operating a grocery store business.  Her husband Eddie, who is 48 years old, works as a transport mechanic to earn a living.  They have two children who are 17 and 20 years old.\r\n\r\nRosemarie joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1999 because she aspired for something better for her family.  With the help of her past 21 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Rosemarie has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow.  Her previous loan of PHP 19,500 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 12,000, improving the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 22nd loan cycle, she is borrowing PHP 19,500 which she intends to use to buy stocks of peanuts and dry goods for her grocery store so that she can continue to save for the future education of her children. Rosemarie S. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through this program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

He lives in his own home with his wife, Deys, who is 26, and their 3 beloved children, for whom they want to provide a better quality of life.  Ronaldo has learned over time that he has to work very hard if he wants his crops to be the best in the town, and so with a lot of effort he has succeeded in producing coffee, achiote, pineapple and stevia crops that are highly sought after in the markets in the city of Pichanaki.  What he likes most about his work is harvesting his products.  He has been doing this work for 8 years, and what he considers most difficult is fumigating his crops since the chemicals he uses are very dangerous.  Over time, he hopes to cultivate all of his lands, since in this way he will be able to improve his production.  This is the second loan he has taken from MFP, and he has always been very punctual with his payments; he expects to do the same with this loan.  In his communal bank he is very supportive with the rest of his fellow group members.  With the 1,000 Peruvian soles he requests he will buy coffee plants, since coffee is what is now selling the best.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":676590,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

Alejandro has been engaged in his business for over 11 years and earns approximately 10,000 PHP a month. He also purchases and sells fruits along with his wife. They have six grown children and live in the village of Eastern, Wao, Lanao del Sur. \r\n \r\nIn 2009, Alejandro joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services.

This previous loan was used to to purchase additional inventory and was employed as working capital. \r\n\r\nAlejandro is now requesting a new loan of 15,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase tools needed for his business as well as to help pay for his utilities. This loan will be the sixth loan taken out by Alejandro from HSPFI. He plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand his business. \r\n \r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n \r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and reaches out to the poor households of northern Mindanao.\r\n \r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":290676,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Restaurant","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To buy rice, beans, cooking oil, sugar, wheat flour and maize flour","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mwanza","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.516667 32.9","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-03-22T14:20:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":625,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ashura","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-04-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":800000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":160000},{"due_date":"2009-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":160000},{"due_date":"2009-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":160000},{"due_date":"2009-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":160000},{"due_date":"2009-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":160000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":125,"local_amount":160000,"processed_date":"2009-05-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:13:18Z","rounded_local_amount":162500,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613674},{"amount":125,"local_amount":160000,"processed_date":"2009-06-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:01:23Z","rounded_local_amount":162500,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010753},{"amount":125,"local_amount":160000,"processed_date":"2009-07-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:38:03Z","rounded_local_amount":162500,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63233039},{"amount":125,"local_amount":160000,"processed_date":"2009-08-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:52:09Z","rounded_local_amount":162500,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73664830},{"amount":125,"local_amount":160000,"processed_date":"2009-09-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T02:45:24Z","rounded_local_amount":162500,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87105542}],"funded_date":"2009-03-22T15:59:10Z","paid_date":"2009-10-16T02:45:24Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jeff Avery","image":233371}},{"id":100475,"name":"Carlos","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Carlos tiene la responsabilidad de mantener su hogar, y gracias al apoyo de su pareja han logrado satisfacer las necesidades de sus dos hijos, quienes tienen lo necesario dentro de su casa donde habitan todos como familia. Todas las madrugadas Carlos sale a comprar pescado en las playas que est\u00e1n cercanas a su hogar para luego venderlo en el mercado mayorista, pues la venta de pescado es una de las actividades m\u00e1s rentables en su localidad, debido a que los comerciantes, ya sean mayoristas o  minoristas visitan ese mercado por la calidad y cantidad de productos. Esto favorece el negocio de Carlos, pero lo dif\u00edcil es despertar a las tres de la ma\u00f1ana y salir a comprar el pescado para  luego trasladarlo al mercado, donde solo puede vender hasta las ocho de la ma\u00f1ana, ya que  los comerciantes s\u00f3lo salen desde muy temprano, y si por alg\u00fan motivos demora en llegar, tiene pocas posibilidades de acabar de vender su producto. Es por ello que en cuanto m\u00e1s pronto salga de casa, tiene mayor ventaja de terminar temprano. Con el tiempo, Carlos desea tener una asociaci\u00f3n de comerciantes pesqueros para ver la posibilidad de exportar los productos o distribuir a diversas ciudades. Carlos es fundador del grupo que desde hace tres a\u00f1os se form\u00f3 en MFP, y este es su quinto pr\u00e9stamo. Como presidente de su banco comunal tiene una grata experiencia de trabajar junto a sus compa\u00f1eras, quienes son muy trabajadoras y comprometidas, a pesar de que por algunas circunstancias se llegaron a desanimar en alg\u00fan momento, siguen trabajando juntos. Adquirir mayor cantidad de producto ayudar\u00e1 a mejorar sus ingresos, y es lo que har\u00e1 con los 1500 soles que ahora solicita. ","en":"Carlos is responsible for the maintenance of his home.  He has been able to meet his two children\u2019s needs thanks to the help of their mother.  The children have everything they need in their house where they all live as a family.  \r\n\r\nEvery morning at daybreak Carlos leave for the beaches that are closest to his home to buy fish.  He later sells them in the wholesale market.  Selling fish is one of the most profitable activities in his area because the merchants, big and small, visit this market for its quality and quantity of products.  This works to his favor.  But, it is difficult to get up at three in the morning, and leave to buy fish to later take to the market, where you can only sell until eight in the morning.  The merchants leave very early; if for any reason you are late getting there you have little chance of selling all of your fish.  Therefore, the earlier he leaves home, the better chance he has of finishing early.  \r\n\r\nIn time, Carlos would like to have a Fishermen\u2019s Merchant Association to see about the possibility of exporting or distributing products to different cities.  \r\n\r\nCarlos is the founder of the group that formed three years ago in MFP.  This is his fifth loan.  As president of his community bank he has the gratifying experience of working together with his companions. They are very hard working and committed.  In spite of the fact that under some circumstances they are momentarily discouraged, they keep working together.  \r\n\r\nAcquiring more product will help him increase his income, and that is what he will do with the 1500 PEN that he is now asking for. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":300611,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish Selling","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Increase merchandise","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-04-16T22:50:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":500,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Carlos","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-03-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.35}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-04-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:50:16Z","rounded_local_amount":262.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36012417},{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T00:59:00Z","rounded_local_amount":262.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44596006},{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-06-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:43:48Z","rounded_local_amount":262.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52990270},{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-07-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:45:34Z","rounded_local_amount":262.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63211394},{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-08-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:27:47Z","rounded_local_amount":262.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73640902},{"amount":83.35,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-09-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:40:09Z","rounded_local_amount":262.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87080369}],"funded_date":"2009-04-17T04:35:24Z","paid_date":"2009-10-15T23:40:09Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ginny Kalish"}},{"id":104571,"name":"Benkadi Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Les femmes du groupe Benkadi ont en moyenne 50 ans, 5 enfants et vivent majoritairement dans des grandes familles polygames.

Their ambition is to acquire agricultural equipment (carts and oxen). <br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1825,"image":{"id":309802,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"To buy grain and condiments ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"S\u00e9gou","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2009-05-01T07:00:22Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1825,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ami","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Oumou                  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fanta                   ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ma\u00efmouna                 ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Aminata                 ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Babou              ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatoumata     ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marama          ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alimata            ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-04-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":900000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1825,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2009-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2009-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2009-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2009-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2009-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":150000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":304.17},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":304.17},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":304.17},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":304.17},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":304.17},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":304.15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":304.17,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2009-05-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:39:04Z","rounded_local_amount":152030.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44621252},{"amount":304.17,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2009-06-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:21:43Z","rounded_local_amount":152030.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53020229},{"amount":304.17,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2009-07-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T19:19:15Z","rounded_local_amount":152030.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63242982},{"amount":304.17,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2009-08-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T22:42:41Z","rounded_local_amount":152030.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73678754},{"amount":304.17,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2009-09-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T03:55:17Z","rounded_local_amount":152030.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87112597},{"amount":304.15,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2009-10-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T07:08:19Z","rounded_local_amount":152030.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97028160}],"funded_date":"2009-05-06T16:12:31Z","paid_date":"2009-11-16T07:08:19Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Daniel Kuey","image":669418}},{"id":108667,"name":"Kossiwa","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Cette dame exerce comme activit\u00e9 g\u00e9n\u00e9ratrice de revenu le commerce d\u2019articles de mercerie, elle a commenc\u00e9 ce commerce en 2006 et s\u2019approvisionne  au grand march\u00e9 de lom\u00e9.

Max is a kind and friendly 40-year-old lady who is married with six children aged 22 \u2013 11 years. She also helps to care for two orphaned relatives and two abandoned children. Of her children, one is at the university while the rest are in secondary schools. She works so hard to ensure that all her children reach university level and get good jobs to support themselves.\r\n\r\nFor ten years, Max has had a business dealing in agricultural products, buying and selling coffee and cotton from Mirarikye. The coffee and cotton are sold to the coffee factories and ginneries respectively, hence enabling her to make monthly profits of UGX 300,000. Her main challenge is that during the rainy season, the roads become impassable, hence increasing the cost of transportation of the produce.\r\n\r\nMax employs coffee and cotton collectors and provides them with bicycles, hence enabling them to make enough purchases.

She lives in the tranquility of her home with her husband (Rosendo) who is 65.  Her grown children, 29 year old Grermer and 21 year old Edilson, live with them.\r\n\r\nShe and her husband rent pool tables in the large living room of their house.  To do this she took out the furniture and set up this unique business.  It is very well received, especially on the week-ends.  Her regular customers are her neighbors and friends.  They visit her pool room to entertain themselves.\r\n\r\nIn the future, Gloria is thinking of buying more pool tables to make her business grow.  She does not have much competition.  Additionally, this hard-working woman sews during the afternoons, and she makes lovely dresses.\r\n\r\nThis is the first time she has had a loan with MFP.  She is in agreement with the work the communal bank does because she has known all of the members for a long time.  She will use the money she is now asking for to buy tools for sewing and for her pool business.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":409688,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Tailoring","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"Buy tools for sewing","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-10-20T01:00:15Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gloria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-10-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":900,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2009-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2010-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2010-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2010-03-13T08:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2010-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":150}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.16},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.16},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":54.17,"local_amount":150,"processed_date":"2009-11-14T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:54:42Z","rounded_local_amount":155.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103843057},{"amount":108.33,"local_amount":300,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T21:07:46Z","rounded_local_amount":311.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734633},{"amount":54.17,"local_amount":150,"processed_date":"2010-02-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:48:57Z","rounded_local_amount":155.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123959716},{"amount":54.16,"local_amount":150,"processed_date":"2010-03-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:32:50Z","rounded_local_amount":155.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128992563},{"amount":54.17,"local_amount":150,"processed_date":"2010-04-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:37:25Z","rounded_local_amount":155.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136717349}],"funded_date":"2009-10-20T07:30:32Z","paid_date":"2010-05-15T11:37:25Z","journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ginny Kalish"}},{"id":149756,"name":"Mable's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mable M. has been running a secondhand clothing sales business for six years and generally generates 30,000 Ugandan shillings per week in profits.

She had to look for the way to earn more income for her family so she gets up at 5 every morning to do everything around the house, go to school to do her job and then afterwards leaves to sell her products. This is Maria's life, but it doesn't get her down as each day she herself gives it value. It is for this reason that she requires this loan, to purchase primary materials. She dreams of expanding her business and not being bad with her payments.  \r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jane McCrory, Kiva

SPBD's loans are Toetu's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He is 58 years old and single. To make a living, he operates a barber shop, providing hair cutting services to local community members. He has been engaged in his business for over thirty-five years and earns approximately $225 a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Rustico joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and ability to engage in business activities. He has successfully repaid a previous loan of 8,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to purchase materials needed to provide the service. \r\n\r\nRustico is requesting a new loan of 11,000 PHP which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This will be his 3rd loan from HSPFI. He plans to use the additional revenue generated to improve his business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She says that she\u2019s asking for a loan to continue investing in her business and she says that her dream is to set up a stable locale and open a women\u2019s underwear shop at home so that her neighbors won\u2019t have to go all the way to town and have to pay transportation costs.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":881079,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy cosmetics.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2011-10-06T18:40:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":575,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Blanca","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-09-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":8000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":470.59},{"due_date":"2011-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":470.59},{"due_date":"2011-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":470.59},{"due_date":"2011-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":470.59},{"due_date":"2011-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":470.59},{"due_date":"2011-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":470.59},{"due_date":"2011-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":470.59},{"due_date":"2011-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":470.59},{"due_date":"2011-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":470.59},{"due_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":470.59},{"due_date":"2011-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":470.59},{"due_date":"2011-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":470.59},{"due_date":"2011-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":470.59},{"due_date":"2011-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":470.59},{"due_date":"2012-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":470.59},{"due_date":"2012-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":470.59},{"due_date":"2012-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":470.56}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.82},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.83},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.82},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.82},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.83},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.82},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.83},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.82},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.82},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.83},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.82},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.82},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.83},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.82},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.82},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.83},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.82}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":179.78,"local_amount":2501.25,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:23:05Z","rounded_local_amount":2519.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238618927},{"amount":179.78,"local_amount":2501.25,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:04:17Z","rounded_local_amount":2519.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244573172},{"amount":113.97,"local_amount":1585.76,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:12:56Z","rounded_local_amount":1597.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250784883},{"amount":101.47,"local_amount":1411.74,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T10:27:29Z","rounded_local_amount":1422.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257193455}],"funded_date":"2011-10-10T13:59:32Z","paid_date":"2012-02-15T10:27:29Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":347201,"name":"Lorna","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lorna is 55 years old, married, and has six children 3 of whom are in school. \r\n\r\nLorna has a pig raising business in the Philippines.

She is 26 years old and is the mother of 2 children who are still dependent on her.  She is married and her husband works delivering food for pigs.  Belcka used the first loan she acquired to invest in the purchase of pigs, her occupation for the last four years.  Currently, she buys piglets and raises them in a pen in the house of her mother-in-law, and then sells them both wholesale and retail, in her town market and to her neighbours.  This generates a monthly income which permits her to pay back her loan punctually.  With this loan of 1000 soles, which will be repaid in six months, she will buy a sow-pig (breeding pig), which will permit her to increase her livestock numbers.

He uses his skills in manufacturing and selling hollow blocks. He has been engaged in his business for over two years and earns approximately 20,000 PHP a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Francisco joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and his ability to engage in business activities. Francisco has successfully repaid a previous loan of 8,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to to finance his sand and gravel business.\r\n\r\nFrancisco is requesting a new loan of 11,000 PHP which will be used to purchase items for a planned sari-sari (variety) store on his business site. This loan will be his 3rd from HSPFI. He plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement the income of his family and support the education of his children. \r\n\r\n\r\n<b>About HSPFI:<\/b>\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines.

Occ. She is 35 years old. Rosela is married and has 3 school-aged children. To make a living, Rosela owns and operates a business venture in the retail sector running a general store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling daily use products such as milo (sachet), shampoo, soap and toothpaste in the local community. Rosela has been engaged in her business for over 2 years and earns approximately 5,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Rosela joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Rosela is requesting a loan of 5,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Rosela from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business.\r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three unit offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":125,"image":{"id":463279,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To purchase additional products to sell.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Misom, Balliangao Mis.

Even though she is separated from her husband, she works very hard every day to provide for her two little ones.\r\n\r\nHer husband left her a small VW van (van for 12 people) so she can rent it and in this way support her children. Every day a chauffeur works with this van to transport passengers. Her eldest son helps out as a payment collector in his free time; despite his young age he obtains some profit from his work. Gregoria is also a teacher in an elementary school and is devoted to her profession part-time every weekday, so that she has enough time for her youngest son. With the earnings from the van they have enough to get by comfortably. She is very proud of her children because they help her out a lot and because they are good students and have a scholarship in their schools, which allows her to save a lot of money. In the future she wants to buy another van to rent it and in this way earn more money.\r\n\r\nThis is the 1st loan she has with MFP and she is very grateful with everyone that makes the loan that keeps her working possible.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is married and has one child, not currently in school. Jane has a business selling charcoal and firewood, which she has had for less than a year.\r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Jane has requested a loan of 200,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to purchase more charcoal and firewood to sell. With the help of the loan, Jane hopes to generate greater profits and be able to buy food and medication for her child.\r\n\r\nIn the future, Jane hopes to own a plot of land. She is a member of BRAC\u2019s Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program, which has helped improve her prospects for the future by teaching her how to expand a business and be self-reliant.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>Note to lenders:<\/b>\r\nBRAC Uganda has recently begun posting a new loan product to Kiva that funds young entrepreneurs in BRAC\u2019s Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. This Kiva borrower is receiving a new ELA loan.\r\n\r\nThe ELA program first provides disadvantaged adolescents, usually girls who are out of school, with livelihood training and financial literacy skills. Afterwards, ELA participants can receive micro-finance loans to expand their small businesses. These loans offer adolescents a unique chance to access finance at a young age and improve their prospects for the future, and target a segment of the population not typically served by traditional micro-finance.\r\n\r\nKiva is privileged to partner with BRAC Uganda in posting these new loans, and give Kiva lenders the opportunity to fund deserving young entrepreneurs and support a promising new sector in micro-finance.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":100,"image":{"id":594277,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Charcoal

aluminio, pero tambi\u00e9n tiene un veh\u00edculo que utiliza como moto taxi, usualmente usado en el municipio de Malambo como medio de transporte. Inicialmente, cuando su esposo dej\u00f3 de trabajar como empleado, emprendieron  el  negocio donde ofrec\u00eda servicios de alquiler de lavadoras y de video juegos, pero la alta competencia que se gener\u00f3 en esta poblaci\u00f3n relacionada con estas actividades, los oblig\u00f3 a retomar la experiencia de 10 a\u00f1os de su esposo en la fabricaci\u00f3n de productos de hierro y  aluminio con los que en la actualidad han logrado  sostenerse en el mercado.\nEste es su segundo financiamiento con la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, con su primero logr\u00f3 aumentar sus ingresos y con ello terminar de construir su apartamento, el que ahora le ofrece nuevos ingresos por concepto de arrendamiento.  Su plan es organizar gradualmente su taller con mejores y m\u00e1s adecuadas herramientas y el mejoramiento locativo del mismo.

At first when her husband stopped working as an employee they set up a business in which they offered washing machine and video game rental services, but the competition that was generated in this community related to these types of businesses was stiff. They were obliged to fall back on her husband's ten years of experience producing iron and aluminum products, by which they currently have successfully maintained their presence in the market. \r\n\r\nThis is her second loan with the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo. With the first loan she successfully increased her income and thus was able to complete the construction of her apartment, which now offers her new income by way of rental. Her plan is to gradually organize her workshop with better and more appropriate tools and to improve its location. \r\n\r\nShe will use her Kiva loan to buy basic supplies such as aluminum, iron, locks, screws, nuts, glass panes, rivets and washers. She will take advantage of the end-of-the-year season during which customers, due to bringing in additional income, typically improve their living conditions and so place orders for doors, grille work and windows from Ingris's workshop. Therefore she hopes to increase her working capital, expand her customer base and raise her profits which would be favorable to the family income and ever-improving quality of life of her three children who range between the ages of 6 and 13. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":850,"image":{"id":622584,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Blacksmith","sector":"Manufacturing","themes":null,"use":"To purchase basic supplies such as aluminum, iron, locks, screws, nuts, panes of glass, rivets and washers\r\n\r\n","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Malambo-Atl\u00e1ntico","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2010-10-23T03:50:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":850,"lender_count":32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ingris Patricia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-10-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":113119},{"due_date":"2010-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":115837},{"due_date":"2011-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":117768},{"due_date":"2011-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":119731},{"due_date":"2011-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":121726},{"due_date":"2011-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":123755},{"due_date":"2011-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":125818},{"due_date":"2011-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":127915},{"due_date":"2011-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":130046},{"due_date":"2011-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":132214},{"due_date":"2011-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":134417},{"due_date":"2011-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":137654}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":64.1},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65.64},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.74},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.84},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.98},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.13},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.3},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.48},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.7},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.92},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.17},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":78}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":64.1,"local_amount":113119,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T14:08:36Z","rounded_local_amount":115887.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182550796},{"amount":65.64,"local_amount":115837,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T13:14:09Z","rounded_local_amount":118672.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188688407},{"amount":66.74,"local_amount":117768,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T03:39:13Z","rounded_local_amount":120650.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191427624},{"amount":67.84,"local_amount":119731,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-16T08:40:16Z","rounded_local_amount":122661.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":196001043},{"amount":68.98,"local_amount":121726,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:05:32Z","rounded_local_amount":124705.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206157206},{"amount":113.76,"local_amount":200754,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:17:50Z","rounded_local_amount":205667.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211230209},{"amount":116.47,"local_amount":205528,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:49:05Z","rounded_local_amount":210558.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221673310},{"amount":70.65,"local_amount":124678,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:06:48Z","rounded_local_amount":127729.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232803031},{"amount":215.82,"local_amount":380859,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:34:58Z","rounded_local_amount":390181.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263325131}],"funded_date":"2010-10-23T12:12:34Z","paid_date":"2012-03-15T09:34:58Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Meg Wolfe-Roberts","image":555476}},{"id":244745,"name":"Ingrid","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Ingrid forma parte del banco comunal \u201cEl Eclipse Valdiviano\u201d, perteneciente a la ciudad de Valdivia.

He is married to Amuteng Florence and is a father of two young children. The family lives together in 3 rooms in Funam-Samtang, a quarter in the Mbengwi Momo Division North West Region of Cameroon. \r\n\r\nDue to the untimely death of C.' parents while he was still young, he was unable to attend secondary school which is one of his set backs now in life. Since then, he has been struggling doing odd jobs. He was encouraged by one of his neighbors, who is a member of GHAPE, to join the organization. C. joined GHAPE in 2007. He took his first loan and invested it in a motor bike business. He used his second and third loans to purchase (palm) kernels. \r\n\r\nComparing his life in the past when he was not a GHAPE member and now, he says he is very fine and that his life has changed dramatically. With this loan, C. wants to buy a kernel-crushing machine. \r\n\r\nWith his experience and the high demand for (palm) kernels, C. is convinced that his business is going to succeed. The profit from this business will be used to add to his capital, provide medication to the family, and also provide school needs for the children. He prefers a loan from GHAPE because of the low interest rate and the training he frequently receives from the GHAPE staff.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout GHAPE \r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon.  GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach.  Every client is trained in business management, basic health, life skills, financial management, profits and losses, and family values.  Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement.  GHAPE instils a sense of family and community within its clients and staff and has developed a strong bond of trust between the organization and its clients.

Once she learned the business, she joined the \"Mujeres con Futuro\" (Women With Futures) community bank because she needed new funds to support the business.

She also subsequently added sales of pork meat.\r\n<p>\r\nWith her own earnings and other loans from the community bank, she set up a small store in her house where she works most days so she only has to travel out to sell her products once a week now.\r\n<p>\r\nThe recently-granted loan of S\/.1,000 (about US$333) from Manuela Ramos, to be repaid in 4 months, will be used to buy merchandise like writing supplies and lamps for the store.

Since her childhood, she was working the land, where was sowing bananas, citrus, coffee, and kion, but five years ago, she started her business of buying and selling fruits and kion with the help of her husband, who is responsible for traveling to farmhouses in the morning to make the purchases. After accumulating the products in his warehouse, Doris puts the kion in sacks and puts the fruit in boxes, so that her cargo is ready when the truck that transports them to the market in Lima arrives. Doris is very happy with her work and what she likes most is selling, which lets her be in contact with people and lets her forget about some physical discomforts that she has. In all this time, her business has generated very good incomes, which have permitted her to pay for her children\u2019s educations, which she hopes to continue even more than agriculture. Doris is very motivated by being part of this new community bank and has offered support in the educational talks to her credit advisor, and in this way, she promises to pay her installments punctually.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b><br>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Davlyatbek is 58 years old and lives with his wife and two children. He has dedicated himself to farming grain, carrots, and other vegetables for more than 5 years.

It served as a key post along the Silk Road and marked the end of Alexander the Great's extensive rule. It was the birthplace of the great Persian poet Rudaki and famous Islamic philosopher Ibn Sina. And it is home to epic mountain passes, communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>IMON\u2019s History<\/b><br>\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

They live in their own home located in the community of Jose Olaya, Pangoa. Custodio is a humble man with a desire to excel. He says that when he arrived to this place in search of better living conditions, he realized that things were not so easy. However, as he is a man of action, he quickly adapted to the ways of work. Thanks to his effort and perseverance, he demonstrated skill and since then has never lacked work. He also won't always work as a laborer.

A motorcycle will enable him to do volunteer community health work, along with income-generating activities, more efficiently. \n\nAdditionally, he will enroll in the local clinic to be on call for any emergencies at night.

weaves huipiles (the typical dress of Guatemala women) by hand and raises chickens, ducks, and turkeys.  She has woven since she was a little girl, but with more simple patterns.  Five years ago she began to weave really detailed and fancy huipiles, such as for weddings.  These cost a lot to weave, not only in terms of thread, but also, more than anything, in terms of time.  She works for up to two or three months on one huipil, but she can sell them in the city of Antigua Guatemala for 3,000 to 3,700 Guatemala Quetzals (US$400-500), depending on the quality and level of detail.  Alejandra is very talented and weaves very beautiful huipiles.  \r\n<p>\r\nShe is requesting this loan to purchase more thread for weaving her huipiles and to buy more chickens and turkeys, food for them, and medicine to prevent illnesses.  She also would like to make improvements to the shelter where she keeps them, such as constructing better walls and buying more corrugated tin to better protect them from the rain.  Right now she has one cow in addition to a bunch of chickens, ducks, and turkeys.  When they are big she takes them to the market in the nearby city of San Martin Jilotepeque for sale.\r\n<p>\r\nAlejandra is married and her husband works in construction in Guatemala City.  They have six children ranging in age from six to twenty-one years old.  All of her children have studied or are currently studying, but only up to the sixth grade because of a lack of economic resources.  Her oldest son just got married in February and, while this was a very happy occasion, it cost a lot, so this loan would help Alejandra a lot right now, as resources are currently a little tight.  This is her first loan with FAPE and she is really excited to have the opportunity to invest in her businesses.  She notes that if she doesn\u2019t have thread, she can\u2019t work, so she needs this loan right away to help her continue working.  \r\n<p>\r\nAlejandra has many dreams for her businesses and her family.  She wants to expand her businesses enough to increase her income to be able to pay for more school for her children and to be able to buy more necessities for them, such as shoes and better clothing.  More than anything she dreams that her children study, find jobs, prosper, and get ahead in life.  \r\n<p>\r\n<b>Translated from Spanish by Megan Montgomery, Kiva Fellow.<\/b>\r\n<p>\r\nAlejandra teje g\u00fcipiles (el vestido t\u00edpico de mujeres en Guatemala) a mano y cr\u00eda pollos, patos, y chompipes.  Ha tejido desde chiquita, pero con dise\u00f1os m\u00e1s sencillos.  Hace cinco a\u00f1os, empez\u00f3 a tejer g\u00fcipiles muy detallados y elaborados, como para bodas.  Estos cuestan mucho para tejer, no solo en t\u00e9rminos de hilo sino, m\u00e1s que nada, en tiempo.  Ella trabaja por hasta dos o tres meses en un g\u00fcipil, pero los puede vender en la ciudad de Antigua Guatemala por 3.000 a 3.700 Quetzales Guatemaltecos (aproximadamente $400-500), dependiendo de la calidad y nivel de detalle.  Alejandra tiene mucho talento y sus g\u00fcipiles son bell\u00edsimas.  \r\n<p>\r\nEst\u00e1 pidiendo este pr\u00e9stamo para comprar m\u00e1s hilo para tejer g\u00fcipiles y para comprar m\u00e1s pollos y chompipes, comida para ellos, y medicinas para ellos para prevenir enfermedades.  Tambi\u00e9n tiene ganas de mejorar el refugio donde guarda los pollos, como con unas vallas mejores y m\u00e1s l\u00e1mina para protegerlos de la lluvia.  Ahora tiene un ganado adem\u00e1s que varios pollos, patos, y chompipes.  Cuando est\u00e1n grandes, los lleva al mercado en la ciudad cercana San Martin Jilotepeque.  \r\n<p>\r\nElla es casada y su esposo trabaja como alba\u00f1il en la ciudad capital de Guatemala.  Tienen seis hijos de edades desde seis a veintiuno a\u00f1os.  Todos sus hijos han estudiado o est\u00e1n estudiando, pero solamente hasta el sexto b\u00e1sico por falta de recursos econ\u00f3micos.  Su hijo m\u00e1s grande acaba de casarse en Febrero, y aunque este era una ocasi\u00f3n muy feliz, cost\u00f3 mucho, entonces ahora este pr\u00e9stamo la ayudar\u00eda much\u00edsimo en este momento, porque tiene pocos recursos ahora.  Este es su primer pr\u00e9stamo de FAPE, y est\u00e1 muy emocionada de tener la oportunidad de invertir en sus negocios.  Dice que si no tiene hilo, no puede trabajar, entonces necesita el pr\u00e9stamo ahorita para ayudarle en seguir trabajando.  \r\n<p>\r\nAlejandra tiene muchos sue\u00f1os para sus negocios y para su familia.

","en":"Genoveva is 57 years old.  She is a very happy woman who remains active in her work.  She lives with the father of her 7 children, 6 of whom still live at home.  She raises cows and plants crops, but of those two activities, she enjoys caring for her animals the most.\r\n<p>\r\nShe wakes up each morning to gather the necessary amount of fodder to feed her cows.  Once the cows are together in a single place, she locks up the calves in a corral until she finishes milking and feeding the adults.  The milk is delivered to a buyer who pays 1.60 soles per liter.  After that, she packs a lunchbox on to her back and walks 3 to 4 kilometers to where her husband is working in the fields.\r\n<p>\r\nGenoveva is very happy to do this work every day because it generates a good income and allows her to accumulate money to maintain her home. In the future, she plans to purchase more calves that become full grown dairy cows that can help increase her daily earnings. \r\n<p>\r\nGenoveva is on her ninth loan with MFP and is committed to completing her payments as she has done previously. She enjoys very much the companionship and support of her communal bank group. Part of the money she is requesting will be used to purchase another plot of land to plant oats that will feed her cows.  The remaining funds will be set aside to buy fertilizer for her potato fields.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":825,"image":{"id":349891,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Purchase fertilizer and animal feed","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-07-11T08:20:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":825,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Genoveva","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-06-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":825,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":2500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":825}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":825,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2009-12-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T15:22:49Z","rounded_local_amount":2512.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734008}],"funded_date":"2009-07-11T15:42:49Z","paid_date":"2010-01-15T15:22:49Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ronan Reodica","image":498323}},{"id":125099,"name":"Faustina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Faustina O. is married and has two children.

She has done this for 26 years and has managed to build up a clientele.  She began with loans and her objective has been to improve her house in order to have a decent place to live.  She lives in a neighborhood in the outlying area of the city, where there is contaminated water, which is troubling since each family has to pay expenses to make their own drain and be able to be in hygenic conditions.  Her plans are to expand her business and sell more.  With this credit she will purchase zinc in order to change out a bad sheet on her roof.  She does not want to suffer through another winter this way, since she has to move her things so they don't get ruined.

Sonia is very knowledgeable about agriculture and she hopes to use this loan to exploit the benefits of her home-made organic fertilizer. Occasionally, Sonia offers workshops to people interested in agriculture and farming.\r\n\r\nSonia has cited communication problems as one of her main obstacles. At the moment, she is waiting to hear back from the government body in charge of phone installations to find out how she might go about getting a phone in her home. Another obstacle for her has been a lack of access to financial services. In the past, Sonia has not been able to obtain the economic resources necessary for the expansion of her poultry-selling business.

who live in La Rita, Lim\u00f3n, located near the Carribbean coast of Costa Rica. The loan consultant who has been working with these women describes them as a motivated collection of individuals with the desire and ability to work hard towards the success of the group as well as the overall improvement of living conditions for the members and their families. In general, the main obstacle to the success of these women has been a lack of access to working capital. This loan will enable the group members to invest in their businesses and expand operations. \r\n\r\nThe women of this group are involved in various productive activities including the rearing and selling of animals (pigs and chickens) as well as commercial and industrial activities. Nuvia, Tania, Yesenia and Lilliana R. have businesses selling clothing in their community. For these women, this loan will be used to finance the purchase of inventory items such as clothing for men, women and children as well as shoes and jewelry. \r\n\r\nLilliana Morin and Doris are in the business of animal rearing. While Lilliana raises chickens and pigs, Doris only handles chickens. For these two loan recipients, this loan will be used to finance investments in livestock, animal feed and construction materials (for the construction of animal pens).\r\nRita is the elected president of this group.  During the week, she takes care of her children and carries out domestic tasks at home. During this time, clients come to peruse various items she has for sale such as clothing, jewelry and shoes. On the weekends, she travels from door to door in her community selling items to clients. Sometimes, her husband goes with her and they travel to neighbouring communities in order to find new clients.\r\n \r\nRita says her main goal is to increase the income generated from her sales business. She says that with more revenue, she will be able to provide a higher standard of living for her family. She would also like to increase the amount of revenue she receives from sales to stores as opposed to individual clients. Rita explained that, like other group members, her main hindrance has been a lack of access to working capital. She says that this loan represents an opportunity to overcome this obstacle. \r\n\r\nThe members of The Women\u00b4s Bank of Faith have been neighbours and friends for a number of years. The group acknowledges the advantages of the group lending model: the ability for each group member to act as a loan guarantor as well as recipient. They also acknowledge the potential disadvantage which could manifest itself if any members have trouble making repayments, as each individual is responsible for all repayments.  \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2675,"image":{"id":612583,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"For the purchase of clothing, jewelry, livestock and animal feed","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CR","country":"Costa Rica","town":"La Rita, Lim\u00f3n","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"10 -84","type":"point"}},"partner_id":151,"posted_date":"2010-10-05T17:40:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2675,"lender_count":90,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lilliana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yensy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tania","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Doris","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yessenia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lilliana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nuvia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ana Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-09-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"CRC","disbursal_amount":1350000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":2675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":215808.46},{"due_date":"2010-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":219405.27},{"due_date":"2010-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":223062.02},{"due_date":"2011-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":226779.72},{"due_date":"2011-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":230559.39},{"due_date":"2011-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":234385.14}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":427.62},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":434.75},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":441.99},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":449.36},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":456.85},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":464.43}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":427.62,"local_amount":215808.46,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T14:02:03Z","rounded_local_amount":216940.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177411576},{"amount":434.75,"local_amount":219405.27,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T14:09:34Z","rounded_local_amount":220556.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182551365},{"amount":441.99,"local_amount":223062.02,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-19T09:52:33Z","rounded_local_amount":224232.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":189148786},{"amount":906.21,"local_amount":457350.84,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T08:42:49Z","rounded_local_amount":459749.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":196970535},{"amount":464.43,"local_amount":234373.41,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-30T07:52:12Z","rounded_local_amount":235602.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201289980}],"funded_date":"2010-10-08T00:19:35Z","paid_date":"2011-04-30T07:52:12Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":240680,"name":"Maria","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Maria C. worked as a hair stylist for many years at Ofir\u2019s Beauty Salon in Brownsville.

He says that even though the loan was small, \"it took me over a hump and enabled me to launch my business with a more complete website, an employee and a strong infrastructure.\"  Without this loan, Frank says getting Business Startups on its feet would have been more difficult.\r\n\r\nACCION Texas-Louisiana was Frank\u2019s first choice for taking out a loan, and is the first loan he has taken out for his business.  \"I have known about ACCION for many years.  I believe in its philosophy and the concept of micro loans.  I also know many people at ACCION.  It is a great organization with great people.\"\r\n\r\nMr. L.\u2019s advice to other small business owners is, \"\u2026 dream big, plan carefully, be persistent, work hard and have faith.\"  On his website, he gives free advice and examples of essential things to consider when starting a business.  This helps entrepreneurs understand the preparation needed for starting a business, and how Business Startups can help meet those needs with expert advice and planning.\r\n\r\nCheck out the Business

She herself was not able to complete her education, and her dream is to enable her children complete their education. She has customers from her community and from among her neighbors as she stands out in her field due to her good prices and the quality of the items in her store.

camino, la actividad economica de la comunidad es la agricultura \u00f3 comercio ya que crian animales como borregos, puercos, pollos y guajolotes para poderlos vender, es manera de poder tener ingresos extras mas que nada de las se\u00f1oras ya que los hombres salen a trabajar y muchos de ellos se van a la ciudad de M\u00e9xico en busca de un trabajo, En el grupo de la carrera se encuentra

cebolla etc; la se\u00f1ora tiene poco mas de 4 a\u00f1os que se animo a vender verdura en su comunidad, no tiene un lugar estable en el que pueda estar vendiendo, lo que hace es andar caminando casa por casa para ofrecer su mercancia, y se le dificulta mucho la caminada y andar cargando la verdura, tambien que le calcula en el peso para poder dar los kilos, pero muchas veces la gente siempre le pide mas porque dice que le falta para completar el kilo, son estas las cosas que en ocasiones desaniman a la se\u00f1ora de seguir con el negocio, la se\u00f1ora Victoria piensa invertir el crdito en comprar mas verdura para salir a vender y tener un poco mas de ganancias y tambien utilizar las cosas que no se vendan para que ella pueda hacer su comida en casa, le gustaria mucho a la se\u00f1ora

The community is large and located on the skirts of a mountain.  To get to it one must travel quite a bit.  Although there is a highway in good condition there is no taxi or bus service.  People relate that it\u2019s quite normal for them to walk quite a bit to get into or to leave their community.  However, they are now used to this and the road doesn\u2019t even seem very long to them anymore.\n\nThe community\u2019s economic activity is farming or commerce since they raise such animals as lambs, pigs, chickens and turkeys to sell.  This is a way of earning extra income more for the women than the men because the men to out to work and many of them go to M\u00e9xico City to look for work.\n\nThe La Carrera group has a representative, Victoria, who tells us about her business.  Her business is selling vegetables.  She sells squash, carrots, squash blossoms, cactus paddles, chayote, cilantro, onions, etc.  It\u2019s been a little more than four years now that she ventured to sell vegetables in her community.  She does not have a fixed location to sell so she does it going house to house to offer her merchandise.  It\u2019s quite difficult for her to walk so much carrying her vegetables.  She also has to calculate the weight to sell by the kilo and often people insist on more because they claim the kilo is short.  These are the things that sometimes discourage her to continue with the business.\n\nVictoria plans to use the loan to buy more vegetables to go out to sell and have a bit more profits and she uses the items she doesn\u2019t sell to prepare her meals at home.  She\u2019d very much like to have a locale of her own to sell several things and to have a large store in order to not have to be wandering about anymore and be able to stay at home with her business.\n\nVictoria has three children going to school.  She\u2019s 37 years old and has been married 14 years.  She lives wither family in her own house and her husband works in M\u00e9xico City.\n\nThe rest of the group members are: \n\n1.-Mar\u00eda \u00c1ngela, she raises sheep and chickens to sell\n2.-Mar\u00eda Bonifacia, she makes napkins and embroiders\n3.-Fidelina, she has a grocery store\n4.-Alejandra, makes napkins, sews and also knows how to embroider\n5.-Julia, raises and sells sheep\n6.-Ernestina, raises chickens and turkeys\n7.-Noe, raises sheep to sell\n8.-Mar\u00eda, knows how to embroider and sells tablecloths\n9.-Abel, has a grocery store in his community\n\nThere are 10 members in the La Carrera group and they named it that way after a community that\u2019s very near them and they like the name very much; that\u2019s why they decided to name their group that.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3925,"image":{"id":816696,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to sell fruit and vegetables.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:45Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":3925,"lender_count":135,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Angela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Bonifacia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Victoria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fidelina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alejandra ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Julia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ernestina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Noe ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Abel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-07-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":46000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":16,"loan_amount":3925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-29T07:00:00Z","amount":5750},{"due_date":"2011-09-29T07:00:00Z","amount":5750},{"due_date":"2011-11-29T08:00:00Z","amount":5750},{"due_date":"2012-01-29T08:00:00Z","amount":5750},{"due_date":"2012-03-29T07:00:00Z","amount":5750},{"due_date":"2012-05-29T07:00:00Z","amount":5750},{"due_date":"2012-07-29T07:00:00Z","amount":5750},{"due_date":"2012-09-29T07:00:00Z","amount":5750}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":490.63},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":490.62},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":490.62},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":490.63},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":490.62},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":490.63},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":490.62},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":490.63}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":1471.88,"local_amount":17250,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-16T08:10:42Z","rounded_local_amount":17321.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227202012},{"amount":981.25,"local_amount":11500,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:12:08Z","rounded_local_amount":11547.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232807421},{"amount":981.25,"local_amount":11500,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:23:02Z","rounded_local_amount":11547.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238619010},{"amount":490.62,"local_amount":5750,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:04:03Z","rounded_local_amount":5773.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244572768}],"funded_date":"2011-08-19T18:02:27Z","paid_date":"2011-12-15T10:04:03Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":322636,"name":"Lluvia Dorada De Ixtlahuaca Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Este grupo se llama \"Lluvia Dorada\" y se ubica en el estado de M\u00e9xico.

She is also happy and friendly. She lives with Santos who is in active service for the military. They have two children, ages 14 and 9, and live in a lovely house that they bought through a lot of hard work. \r\n\r\nLaura rents vehicles known as mototaxis. She started with savings from her husband, buying one mototaxi and looking for a responsible driver. She found one of her neighbors who pays her 30 nuevos soles per day to rent the vehicle. This way she was able to save and buy second mototaxi that she rents to another neighbor who she considers to be responsible. What she likes about her business is the additional income that it generates, as well as watching her capital increase. She doesn't like when it rains because her vehicles break down. She has plans to keep growing and now wants to make her house bigger and build rooms to rent to singles. \r\n\r\nThis will be her 4th loan with MFP.

Huancavelica is considered one of the poorest regions of Peru and has many limitations being a very mountainous area (altituD. ranges from 2,000 \u2013 5,000 meters above sea level), the cold, the difficulty of growing crops and the lack of an adequate infrastructure of roads and communication systems.\r\n<p>\r\nBCR \u201cDios es Amor\u201d is located at approximately 4,000 meters above sea-level, in the community of Pilpichaca, in the district with the same name, province of Huaytar\u00e1. The main activities of the population are growing potatoes and wheat at lower altitudes, and raising sheep and alpaca in the higher areas. The area is known for alpacas and their wool production. Because of the high altituD., the area is not very suitable for agriculture, but the natural grass (pasture) makes it very favorable for raising alpacas and sheep. In the small town of Pilpichaca, on the main road from Huancavelica to the \u201cV\u00eda Libertadores\u201d highway that connects Ayacucho with the coast and Peru\u00b4s capital, L., there are some shops and some produce cheese, but alpaca wool and meat production is the main activity.\r\n<p>\r\nCurrently the bank is starting its first loan cycle with 19 female borrowers and a total loan of 4,400 soles (about 1,575 US$). Most of the loans are of 200 soles, with three exceptions of loans of 400 soles. As the group is just starting its first cycle, the group was not able to save, except for the initial loan to start. But all agree to save in the future.\r\n<p>\r\nOne of the members of the community bank is Lourdes C. C.. Lourdes has a small grocery store where she also sells sweets. Her 200 soles loan she will use to fill up her small store again. During the breaks at the local school, she also sells sweets at the entrance of the school. In the future she hopes to be able to buy a house in a bigger city and run a business there. And like most women, she wants her children to be professionals when they leave college. In the shorter run she will be saving for her children\u2019s education and to increase her business. Now that she has entered in FINCA Peru, she wants to learn how to work more enthusiastically and responsibly and how to save.\r\n<p>\r\nVictoria S. D. S. has her business of selling clothes at local weekly or biweekly markets. Other business she runs are buying and selling of cheese, trout and sheep. With her 200 soles loan she will buy new merchandise to go to the markets. Her dream for the future is to have a small restaurant and to grow little by little.

R. is 49 years old, married, and has 7 children, 3 of whom depend on her. Her oldest daughter is 19 years old and she is in her 5th year of secondary school. Her son of 13 years is in 6th grade of primary school. Her 3 year old daughter is in 2nd grade of primary school. Her husband works as a farmer. Yolanda wishes to make her business more active, because the difficult situation in her country is hard to endure. Furthermore, she wants to continue to contribute help to her children, because they need to have a future that is full of studies, so that in the future they may survive on their own.\r\n\r\nYolanda\u2019s economic activity is a local store in which she sells products like candy, basic grains, ice, soft drinks, chicken, and liquor. Her business is located in her house that is located on Colegio Pureza de Maria 100 Varas Arriba. Yolanda started her business because she didn\u2019t have a stable job as a source of income for her and her family, so she decided to begin the sale of shopping bags and basic grains. In the beginning, she didn\u2019t sell a lot of these products, and so she decided to increase the size of her business and decided to invest in another business of video games and to stock up her store with more products. It is this way that she secured her own workplace that functions as her source of income for her family. This loan is to be used to buy controls for the videogames that she sells, and for her store, because she has to offer a large variety of products to her clients\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Matt Capetola, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":875,"image":{"id":240758,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To buy video game controllers and to stock her store.

He has a business selling secondhand furniture in a rented premises.  His memories of childhood are in the fields, and until now he has done that wonderful activity but only two days a week when it is fruit harvest time.  The purchase and resale of used furniture is a very profitable business.  After each sale he can earn up to 700 soles ($225 USD), put he tells us that at this time his sales are down.  Because of this he is harvesting bananas every weekend, until the demand for furniture improves.  Although he really likes being in his furniture store, Luis does not fail to care for his crops because, for him, they are part of life.  Luis has recently begun to learn about municipal banks, and is very thankful to be a part of one.  This is his first loan, and he is committed to paying the installments on the arranged dates.

SDA Primary school, Makeni was founded in 1978 by SDA Makeni to use education as a vehicle for spreading the Adventist message. They train young boys in the morals and ethics of the Adventist Mission. Presently, the school has a population of fifty-six pupils and a staff of twelve teachers.<p>\r\n\r\nPresently, SDA Makeni suffers a number of constrains. First, they lack a water-well. The tap-head of the well they used to have has been stolen, forcing the children to fetch drinking water from the neighborhood. Second, SDA suffers from lack of sufficient benches and classrooms. They used to have sufficient benches, but rebels used all of those benches as firewood. Then Plan Sierra Leone (an NGO) provided them with new ones, only for people around the neighborhood to steal all of them again. Thus the children have to carry their own benches from home every day to school.<p>\r\n\r\nHowever, with the change of administration three months ago, SDA Primary school is revitalizing, thanks to the new headmaster, Mr. Benjamin Kamara (not part of this loan). The new administration is able to buy benches for classes five and six through school fees subsidies and development funds. The school has also been able to hire two security guards to keep thieves at bay. And for the first time in the history of the school, they will be organizing athletics for the pupils. This will give popularity and fame to the school.<p>\r\n\r\nWith this loan, some of these teachers will start a small business and those who are already running small businesses will invest the loan into their business. Some of the staff members will be using the loan to buy pieces of furniture, others to pay either for their children in their education or pay for themselves to pursue further studies. Others will use their loan in home building projects.  <p>\r\n\r\nAbdul K. K. (back row, second from right) is the leader of this group of teachers. Abdul was born in Mamamah, about 110 miles from Makeni. He is age forty-eight, married to a teacher and the two of them have two children. One of their children is in class four and the other is in class two. Abdul will invest his loan in business and he has been in business for over four years now.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1875,"image":{"id":290802,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Market","sector":"Food","themes":["Conflict Zones"],"use":"Invest in Business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SL","country":"Sierra Leone","town":"Makeni","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"8.883333 -12.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":57,"posted_date":"2009-03-22T06:30:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1875,"lender_count":64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Abdul K.","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Adama","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mabel M.","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Edna F.","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mara M.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

She gets up very early in the morning to go to the wholesale market in order to be able to stock her business with fresh fruit and vegetables as they are perishable foods for which she has a lot of demand.  By mid morning she has no merchandise left and this makes her feel very satisfied and means that her work is very profitable.\r\n\r\nIn addition to this work, she also sells cakes and jellies (jell-o) which she makes herself.  What she likes most about her business is chatting to her customers and also the fact that the provisions which she doesn't manage to sell she uses for her family's meals.  She has been in this business for 6 years and the most difficult thing about her work is packing shopping bags since she suffers from lower back pain.  In the future she is planning to add a second level to her house.  This is her ninth loan from MFP and she pledges to be punctual in her repayments in order to avoid making things difficult for her community bank.

Albeiro works everyday from 5:30 am until 8:00 pm, and although his workday is long, Albeiro believes that only with responsibility, an enterprising spirit and dedication can he make his dream come true, the dream of turning his fruit and vegetable store into a supermarket that offers his customers a large variety of products so he will be able to build his own house.\r\n \r\nRight now Albeiro wants his fruit and vegetable store to have more and more customers, and as a strategy he intends to stock a large variety of products and make some changes to the premises. To do this, he needs a loan because his income is not high enough to cover such an investment.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1125,"image":{"id":768586,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to stock his fruit and vegetable store and make changes to the premises","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Medell\u00edn","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":"2011-05-14T21:00:01Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1125,"lender_count":40,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Albeiro Arleyson ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-05-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":2000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":1125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":87790},{"due_date":"2011-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":90156},{"due_date":"2011-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":92586},{"due_date":"2011-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":95082},{"due_date":"2011-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":97645},{"due_date":"2011-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":100277},{"due_date":"2011-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":102980},{"due_date":"2012-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":105756},{"due_date":"2012-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":108606},{"due_date":"2012-03-11T08:00:00Z","amount":111534},{"due_date":"2012-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":114540},{"due_date":"2012-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":117628},{"due_date":"2012-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":120798},{"due_date":"2012-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":124054},{"due_date":"2012-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":127398},{"due_date":"2012-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":130832},{"due_date":"2012-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":134359},{"due_date":"2012-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":137979}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.38},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.71},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.08},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.49},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.92},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.41},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.93},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.48},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.09},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.74},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.43},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.17},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.95},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.78},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.66},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.59},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75.58},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":77.61}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":49.38,"local_amount":87790,"processed_date":"2011-06-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:22:50Z","rounded_local_amount":88986.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216535238},{"amount":50.71,"local_amount":90156,"processed_date":"2011-07-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-20T07:44:18Z","rounded_local_amount":91384.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":222355498},{"amount":51.65,"local_amount":91820,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-16T08:15:32Z","rounded_local_amount":93071.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227220242},{"amount":108.84,"local_amount":193493,"processed_date":"2011-10-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:42:36Z","rounded_local_amount":196129.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238645967},{"amount":54.13,"local_amount":96223,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:31:49Z","rounded_local_amount":97534.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250814707},{"amount":115.74,"local_amount":205764,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T10:51:26Z","rounded_local_amount":208567.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257223495},{"amount":65.04,"local_amount":115632,"processed_date":"2012-02-11T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:02:03Z","rounded_local_amount":117207.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263361517},{"amount":629.51,"local_amount":1119122,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:06:49Z","rounded_local_amount":1134370.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270074907}],"funded_date":"2011-05-29T14:24:30Z","paid_date":"2012-04-15T10:06:49Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":302164,"name":"Martine","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"N\u00e9e en 1973, Martine est mari\u00e9e \u00e0 Michel un m\u00e9canicien Auto.

So she works selling detergents, disinfectants, soap, and chlorine, among other products. She hires salespeople who are paid a salary, and they sell products door to door.  She also sells from her home, mainly to neighbors and businesses, to whom she gives a better price as they buy larger quantities. Flor works every day from 8:00 am to 6:00 pm and sometimes even later when she has to receive or deliver orders.  She has been dedicated to this activity for 4 years and is doing very well.\r\n\r\nFlor will use the requested loan to buy more products, such as bleach, detergents, disinfectants, soaps, etc. Her dreams are to have a distributor at the provincial level.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":798599,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy chlorine, detergents, disinfectants, soap etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Portoviejo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2011-06-24T23:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":775,"lender_count":28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Flor Del Roc\u00edo","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-06-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":770,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":96.25},{"due_date":"2011-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":96.25},{"due_date":"2011-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":96.25},{"due_date":"2011-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":96.25},{"due_date":"2011-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":96.25},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.25},{"due_date":"2011-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":96.25},{"due_date":"2011-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":96.25}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.88},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.87},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.88},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.87},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.88},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.87},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.88},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":96.87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":96.88,"local_amount":96.25,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:05:49Z","rounded_local_amount":96.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216504269},{"amount":193.75,"local_amount":192.5,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:47:53Z","rounded_local_amount":193.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221668235},{"amount":193.75,"local_amount":192.5,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T09:10:10Z","rounded_local_amount":193.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227036981},{"amount":193.75,"local_amount":192.5,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:04:03Z","rounded_local_amount":193.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232797546},{"amount":96.87,"local_amount":96.25,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:13:44Z","rounded_local_amount":96.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238608640}],"funded_date":"2011-06-27T08:31:15Z","paid_date":"2011-11-15T10:13:44Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Angela Yeh","image":827898}}]}
