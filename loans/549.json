They have four children aged 24, 23, 20 and 16 years old. She has been in the tailoring business for 17 years, assisted by an employee. \r\n\r\nHilderh had tried securing a bank loan but that was futile since the only tangible asset she had was her sewing machine, which was not acceptable within the banking circles.

Before she joined, Teodora already had a small vegetable farm, but she kept it for their family's consumption only. When some of her neighbors started inquiring about buying some of the vegetables that her family could not consume, Teodora got the idea that it would be a good income source if she increased her production and sold vegetables in the local market. As the volume of production grew, she started building good customer relations and soon had many regular customers, some of whom bought vegetables in bulk. Teodora also raised pigs in her backyard as a supplementary source of income. All these ventures were made possible because she is able to access loans for capital from NWTF-Project Dungganon, and the relationship prospers because Teodora always pays her weekly installments on time and fully pays her loan within its loan term.\r\n\r\nBecause her vegetable farm can for now sustain itself, Teodora plans to expand her pig fattening business. She is planning to borrow PHP 25,000 for her 8th cycle loan for this specific purpose.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the calling of not just of a few but thousands of women.

They are 50-years-old on average, have 5 children, and live in the Bagadadji quarter of Segou village (the 4th administrative region of Mali).They know each other through neighbors, are professional, and work trading miscellaneous articles. After having paid back their last 5 loans, they are together for their sixth loan. They plan on using it to buy 10 pieces of waxed cloth, 4 embroidered dress fabrics, 10 bed sheets, 5 cotton suits for men (Faso danfani), 20 5-meter damasque fabrics, products for dying, 3 tons of wood charcoal, 1 truckload of firewood, 15 sacks of unshelled peanuts, and supplies to make incense. They buy the cloth and linens in bulk once a month in Lom\u00e9, Guin\u00e9e Conakry and Burkina Faso while they purchase the damasque fabric and dye products in Bamako; the firewood and charcoal are provided by transporters from Konobougou. The peanuts and the incense supplies are bought at the Chateau market at Loulouni and Koutiala's stalls. Now, with the holidays approaching, provisions and sales are increasing. They sell the clothing and incense in Sikasso, Dioila, and Macina, traveling across the Angouleme and Bagadadji regions, while the wood and charcoal are sold to households and the peanuts are sold at the weekly fair in Segou and at the Segou Coura Market. Sales, both wholesale and retail, are made in cash and credit to male and female customers. They expect an average monthly profit of 62,500 FCFA. This profit will repay the loan and the tontines, fulfill their small family needs, assure fresh food, pay for their children's travels to study in Bamako, and finance participation in social events. Their ambitious hard work continues to make their commercial activities profitable and assure the health and education of their children.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Kelly Percival, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1425,"image":{"id":429734,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"Achat d\u2019articles divers. - Buying of miscellaneous items","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"S\u00e9gou","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:39Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1425,"lender_count":38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Dj\u00e8n\u00e8ba                  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kadiatou                  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ma\u00efmouna        ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Aich\u00e9               ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Awa                                      ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-11-10T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":625000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":104166.67},{"due_date":"2010-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":104166.67},{"due_date":"2010-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":104166.67},{"due_date":"2010-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":104166.67},{"due_date":"2010-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":104166.67},{"due_date":"2010-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":104166.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":237.5},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":237.5},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":237.5},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":237.5},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":237.5},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":237.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":237.5,"local_amount":104166.67,"processed_date":"2009-12-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T17:03:41Z","rounded_local_amount":104747.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110763562},{"amount":237.5,"local_amount":104166.67,"processed_date":"2010-01-09T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:36:12Z","rounded_local_amount":104747.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118152393},{"amount":237.5,"local_amount":104166.67,"processed_date":"2010-02-08T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T11:18:36Z","rounded_local_amount":104747.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123991235},{"amount":237.5,"local_amount":104166.67,"processed_date":"2010-03-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:59:54Z","rounded_local_amount":104747.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":129021505},{"amount":237.5,"local_amount":104166.67,"processed_date":"2010-04-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T12:15:03Z","rounded_local_amount":104747.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136746307},{"amount":237.5,"local_amount":104166.65,"processed_date":"2010-05-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T10:03:18Z","rounded_local_amount":104747,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144778859}],"funded_date":"2009-12-04T05:24:55Z","paid_date":"2010-06-15T10:03:18Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kelly Percival","image":null}},{"id":158505,"name":"Elvira","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Elvira L. lives in Hacienda Malisbog 4, Brgy E Lopez, Silay City, Negros Occidental. She is 45 years old. Her husband, Rogelio, works as a tricycle driver within their village and around Silay City. She has two children who are presently attending school. Her dreams in life are to help her husband generate additional income for the family, so that her children can finish their studies. She also wants to improve her family's living conditions.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 1998 Elvira joined the Kiva field partner, NWTF-Project Dungganon, to have capital to invest in a business. She used her loan for a tricycle as the source of their income. She also invested in the buying and selling of scrap, like empty bottles, scrap iron, plastics and many other things that can be useful and acceptable to sell. As she continued her loans with NWTF, her business grew and earned additional income for the family. She would get a minimum income of $77 a month, which she used for her family. \r\n<p>\r\nPreviously, Elvira borrowed 19,500 PHP as additional capital for her scrap business and it was paid back on a weekly basis, and fully paid within her loan term without any delay. Because of her good credit performance, she was able to access a bigger loan. She recently borrowed  25,000 PHP for her 18th cycle loan, to use as additional capital for her scrap business. The income will be used for the education of her children and for her business.\r\n<p>\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress out of earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed on a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest

The dairy goat she intends to buy is not just an ordinary goat. It\u2019s a breed that produces between 2-5 liters of milk a day. With this goat, she will produce more milk which will translate to more income. Demand for goat milk in the Chuka area is high but the supply is low.

She is a 50-year-old married woman, with two children who are in school. She treks to Asamang, a town in the eastern region of Ghana, to purchase palm oil from the producers in bulk so she can sell it to her customers. She says increased prices of rice and fuel have affected her working capital and she can no longer buy enough palm oil to sustain her business.

She is divorced which is why she lives with her children Edita, a 26 year-old, Jos\u00e9 Carlos, a 24 year-old, and Julio C\u00e9sar, a 22 year-old.  She works in the making of shoes thanks to the teachings of her parents who also worked in this business.  She starts very early, sewing, gluing and more so that in the afternoons she can account for what she has produced and deliver to people who have placed orders with her, ending at about 7 or 8 at night.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b><br>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Oriental. She earns her living by raising hogs.\r\n \r\nFlordeliza\u2019s husband helps her in raising hogs, cows and other animals to sell, and they have five children, some of whom are still in school while the others are adults. They also help their parents in the business as part of their daily chores.\r\n\r\nFlordeliza joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1999 in the hope that she would be able to help her husband improve the quality of life of their family. With the help of her loans from NWTF-PD, she has been able to increase their family income by engaging in hog raising and other animals to sell. Now she earns an average monthly income of Php 10,000 from her business activities.\r\n\r\nFlordeliza is a member of good standing. Her previous loan of Php 15,000 was used to fund operations of her hog raising and other animals, and had a positive impact on both the business and the family\u2019s living conditions. Now she is borrowing her 14th loan in the amount of Php 15,000, which she  intends to use on her hog raising business. Flordeliza is working hard to achieve her dreams and aspirations for her family, which is to provide them with a brighter future and a more comfortable life.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\n  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of  thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means \"Honorable\"). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress out of earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them \"Dungganon\" -- a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":448153,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Additional

She's married to Joseph SAGBO, a cook. She's the mother of two children, and has another child to support. Some children attend school. For approximately five years, the family has been living in l'Etoile in Cotonou, the economic capital of Benin. The couple supports the family together. Conforte never attended school. To provide for herself, she sells biscuits as an ambulant saleswoman. She gets her supplies in Lom\u00e9, Togo, a country that border Benin. She's been running this business for four years. She's a previous client of Kiva's partner, ALID\u00e9, who repays her loans without problems. Conforte experienced some financial difficulties when repaying her previous loan: one of her child got burned, a situation which induced expenses. Today, she ambitions to expand her business in order to better satisfy her customers and raise her income to match her expenses.

district of Cochabamba. She studied Physiotherapy and works with people of limited resources in the hospitals around the city. \r\n\r\nShe looks after her mother and elderly grandmother; her father abandoned them when Cecilia was three years old. She has been working since she was very young to be able to help her mother, who is sick, and her grandmother, who suffers from rheumatism. Cecilia tries to help her grandmother however she can, because the visits to the specialist, and the medicines she has to take for the pain, are very expensive.\r\n\r\nCecilia is seeking the loan to buy materials for her therapy work. She already runs a clinic at home where she can treat patients, just as she does when she visits them at their homes. She is trying to work as much as possible and maximise her income so she can help as much as she can with the household exprenses. Cecilia is a very responsible, hard-working woman.\r\n\r\nIn the future, she would like to have a surgery where she can help everyone who comes needing physiotherapy treatment.

He has been practicing mixed farming for the last 6 years and employs one farmhand. He sells his milk, tomatoes, and beans to the local market. He mainly depends on the income from his farm to cater to the basic needs of his family. Ambrose is 37 years old and married with five children.\r\n\r\nHe has requested for this loan of 31,200 Kes through Juhudi Kilimo to purchase and insure a dairy cow. The extra income from the sale of milk will enable him to improve the living standards of his family.

He formed his family with Emilia, his wife of 24 years, there.  They have two adult children: Felicitas and Elisa.  Now, they live by themselves in their own house.  He feels very happy because he now lives only with his wife after so much work to raise their children.\r\n\r\nThis dedicated man works in farming.  He learned while still very young by watching the farming techniques needed to plant and to cultivate the land.  Because of this he currently grows lima beans, potatoes and peas.  Field work is by no means easy and Cipriano cares for his fields with much dedication.  He relates that during harvest time he hires day workers to help him bring in the harvest that he then sells to wholesalers that offer the best prices for his crops.

It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, PHP 5 worth of cooking oil or an egg. Anita earns an income by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house and her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 500 PHP in daily sales.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, Anita is requesting a PHP 10,000 loan, which she will use to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nAnita hopes to be able to expand soon, just as she dreams of being able to give her family a good future through all her hard work.

With the amount that she asks for she will buy a larger quantity of sweets for her store.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Breanne Kochert, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":242251,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Increase of the merchandise that she sells","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"HUANCAYO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.066667 -75.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2008-12-25T05:00:12Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":175,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Julia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-11-20T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2009-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2009-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2009-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2009-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2009-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":85}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":29.05},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":29.05},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":29.05},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":29.05},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.05},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":29.05,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2008-12-19T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T01:24:58Z","rounded_local_amount":89.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9957896},{"amount":29.05,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2009-01-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T14:08:27Z","rounded_local_amount":89.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":10228251},{"amount":29.05,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2009-02-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T20:07:27Z","rounded_local_amount":89.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20423483},{"amount":29.05,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2009-03-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:39:18Z","rounded_local_amount":89.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27116745},{"amount":29.04,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2009-04-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:48:37Z","rounded_local_amount":89.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36011676},{"amount":29.76,"local_amount":85,"processed_date":"2009-05-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T00:56:13Z","rounded_local_amount":91.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44595285}],"funded_date":"2008-12-25T10:11:17Z","paid_date":"2009-06-16T00:56:13Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Breanne Kochert","image":398211}},{"id":84591,"name":"Marcelita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Marcelita O. is already 31 years old, married to Argie who is an OFW (Overseas Filipino Worker).

Ipil-ipil, Brgy Vito, Sagay City, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating 3 business ventures: sari-sari (general) store, fishing, and pig fattening businesses. Her husband Francisco B., who is 45 years old, works as a fisherman to earn his living, and also helps in his wife's business activities. Their only child is 19 years old. \r\n\r\nCarmelita  joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1992 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 29 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Carmelita  has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 29,500, which was funded by Kiva lenders, helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 10,000, uplifting the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 30th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 35,000, which she intends to use to purchase more stock to sell in her general store and also to buy a side-car for her motorcycle transport so that she can continue to save up for the future to sustain their daily needs and to educate her daughter. Carmelita B. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She earns her living by operating three business ventures:   food production, buying and selling medicines, and buying and selling rice. \r\n\r\nHer husband, Orly G., who is 41 years old, works as a farmer to earn his living. They have one child who is 11 years old. \r\n\r\nMarlyn joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2004 because she aspired for something better for her family.  With the help of her past 15 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Marlyn has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 10,300 Philippines pesos (PHP) helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 20,000, thus uplifting the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 16th loan, she is borrowing PHP 21,000, which she intends to use to buy spices and ingredients for the food she makes. She would like to continue to save up for the future education of her children and family needs. Marlyn G. is a Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable) woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.  \r\n\r\n<b>About NWTF:<\/b> In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon. Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams.

Bobbie, who has been in the insurance business for nine years, started her business with TWFG Insurance Services in 2007.  Her business offers personal and commercial insurance lines to customers, including health and life insurance.\r\n\r\nBobbie has two employees who work with her in Corpus Christi, as well as agents in Laredo, New Braunfels, and Lufkin (all cities in Texas).  Until now, Bobbie has relied on referrals and word-of-mouth advertising to bring in business, in addition to networking extensively with local realtors and the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce.  With this loan, she will print and distribute a brochure promoting the services TWFG offers.  Having already established a strong clientele in Corpus Christi, this mail-out will focus on reaching potential clients in nearby towns.  This marketing effort will hopefully generate new business and provide a better understanding of possible new markets.  Bobbie\u2019s long-term goal is to open a second local office, and she will use the response from this mail-out to evaluate potential locations.\r\n\r\nFor Bobbie, owning her own business means that every day is interesting.  With the insurance industry as competitive and time-intensive as it is, she says that \u201cburn-out\u201d is a major problem for insurance agents.  She thinks that she stays engaged because she is always doing different things.  As a single mother, Bobbie says that owning her own business allows her to set her own schedule.  She loves being able to spend time with her son and attend his various activities.\r\n\r\nThis is Bobbie\u2019s second loan with ACCION Texas-Louisiana.

Numan lives in the Jabalia Refugee Camp in Gaza Strip. He is a taxi driver; he took out a loan from FATEN to perform car maintenance. The taxi is the only source of income for the six family members. \r\n\r\nNuman doesn't have enough cash to pay for the car maintenance, therefore FATEN's loan is necessary to improve the family's financial situation.\r\n\r\nNuman appears in the picture next to the taxi. \r\n\r\nAbout this loan product:\r\n\r\nFATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. \r\n\r\nFATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. \r\n\r\nAs with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

She is 54 years old, and is widowed with one adult-aged child. To make a living, Leonora owns and operates a business venture in the retail sector running a sari-sari or general store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from selling both food and daily use products in the local community. Leonora has been engaged in her business for over a year and earns approximately 1000 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2009, Leonora joined Kiva partner, GDMPC, to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Leonora is requesting a loan of 5000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be her first from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve her family's general living conditions. \r\n<p>\r\n<b>About GDMPC<\/b><br>\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three unit offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n<p>\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

En el barrio Bellavista de Malambo, municipio ubicado en el \u00e1rea metropolitana de Barranquilla, todos la conocen porque tiene este negocio que inicio, cuando le llevaban la tela, tomaba medidas, dise\u00f1aba y elaboraba la ropa de acuerdo a lo solicitado y que fue creciendo tanto, que empez\u00f3 a fabricar por tallas y a comercializar en las poblaciones del Departamento del Atl\u00e1ntico. Ella ha pasado por muchas dificultades familiares, pero siempre se ha sobrepuesto y le han servido para mejorar; as\u00ed Fu\u00e8 cuando se separo de su esposo y se mudo sola a Medell\u00edn, ciudad de Colombia reconocida por sus pasarelas de elegancia, glamour y sensibilidad de modistos y dise\u00f1adores colombianos e internacionales; all\u00ec fu\u00e8 donde perfeccion\u00f3 su arte, pues trabajo desde su negocio para dise\u00f1adores de ferias internacionales realizadas en esa ciudad, y pudo, mediante un cr\u00e9dito del estado, reiniciar su negocio e intentar regresar por sus hijos a Malambo, decisi\u00f2n que no concreto porque fue favorecida por subsidios del programa de Familias en Acci\u00f3n del estado y por eso  hace 6 anos, se estableci\u00f2 en esta poblaci\u00f3n para desde all\u00ed apoyar los estudios de sus hijos sin interrumpirlos. \n\nAracelys ingres\u00f3 a la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo con el programa de grupos solidarios en el a\u00f1o 1995 y recibi\u00f3 5 cr\u00e9ditos antes de que algunas compa\u00f1eras del grupo empezaran a trabajar en empresas, ella misma cambiara de ciudad y este grupo se desintegrara;  cuando ella regres\u00f2 de Medell\u00edn, encontr\u00f3 nuevamente el apoyo de la Fundaci\u00f3n, adquiri\u00f3 una fileteadora y comenz\u00f3 a trabajar para terceros.

Esta es la raz\u00f3n por la que solicita un cr\u00e9dito de $2.300.000 que invertir\u00e1 en la compra de una m\u00e1quina industrial, a fin de confeccionar en tela pesada, como la de los jeans y poder tener la suya propia con lo ahorrado por concepto de arriendo. \n\nAracelys Mar\u00eda, sue\u00f1a con adquirir su propia marca, tener una mejor vivienda y ver culminada la educaci\u00f3n de sus hijos; su mayor desaf\u00edo es organizar una infraestructura completa para ejercer su arte y ayudar en la educaci\u00f3n de sus hijos sin el ingreso de su esposo, por eso duplica sus esfuerzos y tambi\u00e9n se dedica simult\u00e1neamente a la venta de mercanc\u00edas cosm\u00e9tica.","en":" For 21 years, Aracelys Maria Ramirez M., 44 years old, has been dedicated to the profession of seamstress. She is an authentic female head of household who has always participated in productive, reproductive, educational, domestic and community activities to acheive a better future for her 5 children. In the Bellavista de Malambo neighborhood, a town located in the metropolitan area of Baranquilla, everyone knows her. When she started this business, they would take her the fabric, she'd take measurements, and she would design and make the clothing according to what they had ordered. It grew so much that she started to make clothes in sizes and sell them in the towns of the Atlantico Department. She has gone through many family hardships but she has always overcome and they have improved her. That is what happened when she separated from her husband and moved alone to Medellin, a city in Colombia known for its elegant runways, its glamour, and the sense of its Colombian stylists and designers.   She was able, with a state credit, to begin her business again, and try to return for her children to Malambo. This decision didn't happen because she was favored by the Families in Action program of the state and that is why, 6 years ago, she established herself in this town to support her children's studies from there without interruptions.  \r\n\r\nAracelys entered the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo with the support groups programs in 1995 and she received 5 loans before some of the other members of the group started to work in businesses, she herself changed towns, and the group began to disintegrate.  When she returned to Medellin, she again found the support of the Fundaci\u00f3n. She acquired a sewing machine and started to work for others. For 2 years she sewed for a clothing wholesaler in a small factory.  Now she does it for a chain of stores that has supplied her with a 2 needle machine, but she must pay rent for the pieces and the work exclusivity. This activity does not make her a lot of money. This is the reason she is asking for a loan of $2.300.000  which she will invest in the purchase of an industrial machine. This will be in order to sew with heavy fabrics, such as denim, and to be able to keep for herself what she pays in rent.  \r\n\r\nAracelys Mar\u00eda dreams of acquiring her own label, having better housing, and finishing her children's education. Her biggest challenge is organizing a complete infrastructure to pracrice her art and help in the education of her children without her husband's income. This is why she doubles her efforts and at the same time sells cosmetic merchandise. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ellen Donohue, Kiva

At 6:00 or 7:00 am, people come to the dam to fish.  They say that the big fish are not easy to trap and weigh about two kilos or more, but they need to take a boat to the middle of the dam to catch them.  \r\n\r\nThe group is called Progreso Mazahua [Mazahua Progress] because the group wants progress, and they come from the community of Mazahua, where adults speak the Mazahua language and children learn it in school.  The group has nine members, seven women and two men.  Members of the group are involved in trade, but also people who have animals: cattle, horses, poultry, and sheep.\r\n\r\nTeresa is the representative of the group.  She works doing embroidery and sewing.  She makes tablecloths, jackets, napkins, and she makes her children's clothes.  Teresa is 39 years old and has been married for nine years.  She has two young children.  The oldest is about to turn five and the youngest is two years old.  They don't go to school yet.  Her husband works buying and selling cattle and raises animals.  They live in their own house.  Teresa wants to help her husband with the household expenses, so she sells her embroidery.  She said a difficulty she has in her business is finding customers who want to purchase her products because few people are interested in purchasing art right now.  \"The loan will give me a lot of help making embroidery and from there I can help with the costs and with the income I can do something else, for example, another business and see the way to improve and pay the loan.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He lives in his own house, which is constructed of rustic materials. Caciano is a young man who is focused on his responsibilities and works with great conscientiousness to excel with his plantings of cacao. After he harvests the cacao, he takes it to the city of San Francisco to sell. There are various buyers there, who, knowing the quality of his products, don't hesitate to wait for him so that they can buy his harvest wholesale. What he likes most about his work is planting his fields and making them fertile and productive. He has been doing this work for five years. He considers the most difficult part of his work to be fumigating his plantings for pests, since he has to do it with great care, because the chemical products cause reactions and he fears for his future health. \r\n\r\nThe loan he is applying for is for maintaining his crops. In the future, he hopes to continue saving his income, because he wants to buy new fields. This will be his first loan from MFP. He knows that the money from the loan will be very beneficial for the development of his work. He feels happy to belong the group of members of his communal bank. With the 1000 PEN, he will hire day workers so that they can help him in the maintenance of his fields, for example, by pruning, clearing, and fumigating.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":980631,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to hire laborers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-01-19T04:30:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Caciano ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-12-24T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":375}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":375,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:32:12Z","rounded_local_amount":1009.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308451256}],"funded_date":"2012-01-19T17:47:59Z","paid_date":"2012-10-16T09:32:12Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Pam McMurry","image":null}},{"id":417570,"name":"Achol","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Achol lives in bor.

Jane is a hard working and bold lady who knows what she wants, no matter what. She is the leader of Kanyansheko Bakyara Twimukye group in Ibanda and a widow, with 7 children. All of her children are in O level school. She also cares for many relatives, although they do not stay with her. Jane has had a business of rearing goats for sale for 3 years, in Nyakigando village. The main business challenge is the failure to access drugs for her animals. She is able to make 50,000 UGX as profits per week, hence being able to look after her children.

This is 31-year-old Matron M. from Mbeya. She is married with one  2-year-old child.  Matron has been running a tailoring business since 2007. Her business is making different types of clothes.\r\n\r\nShe works at the business for 9-12 hours per day, six days per week. Matron currently earns about US$50 a month from her business.

Matron thanks you for your support!\r\n\r\nABOUT SELFINA:\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through microleasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":351119,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Tailoring","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"To purchase additional stock of tailoring material ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbeya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.9 33.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-07-11T16:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Matron ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-07-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2010-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":83333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-08-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:55:56Z","rounded_local_amount":87400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73665081},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T02:50:54Z","rounded_local_amount":87400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87105793},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-10-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T06:32:47Z","rounded_local_amount":87400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97022903},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:44:59Z","rounded_local_amount":87400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103868144},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-12-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T16:47:07Z","rounded_local_amount":87400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110757340},{"amount":66.65,"local_amount":83333.35,"processed_date":"2010-01-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:34:54Z","rounded_local_amount":87400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118146434}],"funded_date":"2009-07-11T20:51:36Z","paid_date":"2010-02-15T12:34:54Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Allison Bruce","image":77230}},{"id":125583,"name":"Se\u00f1or De Puquin Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"\nLos socios son un n\u00famero de 16, ellos pertenecen al banco comunal \u201cSE\u00d1OR DE PUQUIN\u201d, ubicado en el distrito de Huanchac en la provincia y departamento del Cusco. \n\nNuestros socios alternan sus diferentes actividades con el comercio minorista, ellos requieren este capital de trabajo para invertir en sus diferentes negocios peque\u00f1os, ellos venden comida, algunos tienen sus stand en colegios y laboran en el recreo de los alumnos, otros solicitan para aumentar su negocios en el mercado de confraternidad, otras socias tienen un peque\u00f1o cafet\u00edn y tienda de abarrotes, para lo cual solicitan el pr\u00e9stamo.\n\nLos socios agradecen y valoran el pr\u00e9stamo otorgado mediante este medio, y se comprometen a cumplir con el pago en el plazo establecido.\n","en":"There are 16 members in the Se\u00f1or de Puquin Community Bank, which is located in the Huanchac district, Cusco province and department.\r\n\r\nThe members have different small businesses.

They have 2 children, 5 year old Sarai and 2 year old Tany, and the four of them live in their own home located in the rural area of Santa Clara. Their future plan is to acquire their own farm land. For 5 years they have been working hard on rented land where they sow potatoes, peas, beans, and other vegetables which, after each harvest, they sell in the central marked of the city Tarma. Each harvest is a result of Eduardo's hard work and brings him good profits which, thanks to the support of the community bank, he is saving up. In very little time he will be able to buy his own land. He predicts that this will bring him greater income and he will be able to buy much more. This is his sixth loan from MFP, and he is grateful for the lessons offered to the bank members which motivate him to be successful and think of the future. He will use this loan to buy organic fertilizer which he will apply to his \"arenosa\" variety potatoes which he will be harvesting in the coming months. He will also buy pea seeds.

His wife runs a grocery shop and they have two children aged four years old and one year old whom they wish to give a good education to the university level. His business is located at the busy Kibuye market in Kisumu. Kisumu is the region in Kenya that harbors Lake Victoria and is commonly referred to as the lake basin.\r\n\r\nCliffton runs a carpentry shop in which he makes beds, cupboards, couches and other things for the local people. He has been operating this business for nine years now and has managed to provide employment to two people. He says that this business is profitable and the major challenge he has is financial constraints.

He has 10 years of experience working as a car mechanic.  In 2005, he opened his own car repair shop. He states that his business income is barely sufficient to satisfy his needs. So from time to time, he also works in a locA. company in order to earn extra money and be able to meet his financiA. obligations.

Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He is married and a loving and responsible father of one child.  Since 1999, he has been working in the business arena and has a rich enough experience to continue and expand his business.  He is involved in buying and selling dried fruits and animal husbandry.  He has received several loans from Imon International and repaid all of them successfully.  This loan would allow Tuichiboi to expand his business and, thus, pay for his son to go to a university.  His life would improve quite a bit, and he is grateful to all for the support.

He earns a living by selling clothing, blankets and covers.  Due to his family\u2019s economic situation, he was unable to continue studying.  For the past 5 years he has worked and progressed little by little to earn a salary.  William really likes what he does, thanks to this job he has hopes for a better future.

He has to endure the cold at night and the strong heat during the day, but William always does his best because he knows that every sacrifice has a reward.  He is a new member of his community bank and is applying for his first loan with Microfinanzas Prisma.  He will be very punctual with his payments because he is very grateful for this opportunity and will not disappoint the people who trust him.  With this money he will increase the number of blankets to sell in order to increase his earnings and help his business.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Rachel Crouch, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":258401,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"buy blankets to sell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Juliaca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15.5 -70.133333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-01-19T17:50:11Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"William","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":165}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":54.28},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":54.28},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.28},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.28},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.28},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.6}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":54.28,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-02-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T20:02:04Z","rounded_local_amount":170.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20423640},{"amount":54.28,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-03-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:33:10Z","rounded_local_amount":170.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27116909},{"amount":54.27,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-04-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:42:32Z","rounded_local_amount":170.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36011830},{"amount":54.28,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T00:58:31Z","rounded_local_amount":170.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44595424},{"amount":54.28,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-06-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:37:29Z","rounded_local_amount":170.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52989671},{"amount":53.61,"local_amount":165,"processed_date":"2009-07-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:39:17Z","rounded_local_amount":168.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63210792}],"funded_date":"2009-01-19T19:25:10Z","paid_date":"2009-08-15T16:39:17Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Rachel Crouch","image":59003}},{"id":88735,"name":"Mrs. Saroeurn Chev Village Bank Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Thirteen people living in Tang Kley village in Kampong Chhnang province comprise this village bank loan, and they will use the loan for various purposes.
