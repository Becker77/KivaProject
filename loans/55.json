None of her children goes to school because she couldn\u2019t raise school fees.  She rents a one-room house where she lives with five people. Gorreth takes care of additional family members. The family has access to electricity, but no piped water, and gets three meals a day. \r\n<p>\r\nShe incurs transportation costs to and from Kawala.  She works in a semi-urban area which is on the outskirts of Kampala. Gorreth works seven days a week, receiving an average of twenty-five customers a day. She sells to all categories of people, at both retail and wholesale prices. \r\n<p>\r\nGorreth owns a canteen at the Nakulabye Church of Uganda primary school. Her major business challenges include the ever-increasing prices of cooking oil, baking powder, charcoal and the rainy season, which hinders her customers from reaching her because she works from an open place. Her monthly expenses include rent, feeding the family and medication.  \r\n<p>\r\nShe has been in this business for seven years and with MCDT for four years, now servicing her seventh loan. Gorreth joined MCDT because it was near her home and the group was easy to work with. She wants to use this loan to buy more baking powder and cooking oil. She is hoping to see her business grow bigger, and she would like to start distributing samosas, chapatti and pan cakes to different nearby schools.\t\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":428558,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cafe","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To

While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nYolanda is married and has 5 adult children. To make a living, Yolanda owns and operates a general store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from selling food and daily use products in the local community. Yolanda has been engaged in her business for over 5 years and earns approximately 3000 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2011, Yolanda joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Yolanda is requesting a loan of 5000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the 1st loan taken out by Yolanda from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve her family's general living conditions. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 38 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Typically, Nepali households grow crops on small plots of terraced land.  Rice (bhat), lentils (daal), and vegetables (thakari) are the staples of the Nepali diet.  With a Kiva loan, BPW's borrowers are able to purchase greater amounts of seed and fertilizer.  With more seeds and fertilizer, a borrower is able to grow cash crops to be sold in the local market.  Such crops allow households to move beyond subsistence and provide much-needed income throughout the year. \r\n\r\nThis loan was administered by Kiva's local partner MFI, Patan Business and Professional Women.

Since he did not have the opportunity to advance at school for social reasons, Bassirou rapidly launched himself into buying and selling hardware products (cement, paint, quicklime, wire, glues, etc.). He has a hardware store in Sikasso's Grand Market and is in great demand from his customers for the quality of his products.\r\n\r\nIn order to satisfy his ever-growing customer base, he decided to collaborate with the microfinance institution, Soro Yiriwaso. He is on his first loan from the institution, so that he can boost his activity and respond better to customer demand.

The others are not at a school going age.  I am 29 years old.  \r\n\r\nSince I was child I have loved education, but I couldn\u2019t go to study because my parents wouldn\u2019t allow me to go to school.  They suggested I stay at home and make embroidered dresses.  My mother taught me this art.  \r\n\r\nWhen I got married and became a mother, I decided to give my children a good education because it has become essential in every walk of life.  \r\n\r\nMy husband\u2019s earnings are not so good, but he wants to start a business of clothes selling.  I have successfully repaid my first loan, which I took from Asasah (a microfinance institute of Pakistan).  Now I am applying for a loan to buy clothes to resell. \r\n\r\nI am a group leader of a few more members in my community.  Sajida Parveen Baji wants a loan to repair a vehicle named \u201cShahzore\u201d.  I. A. Baji wants a loan to buy more mobile phones for her mobile phone selling business.  Mahnaz Baji wants a loan to buy wood to resell.  Salma Baji wants a loan to buy materials (sugar, milk and dry fruits) for her sweetmeat selling business. \r\n\r\nThis is a group loan.  The loan funds will be distributed among the group members, each of whom will invest in her own business.  The members mutually guarantee one another's loans.  If one member does not repay, the other members are responsible.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":240354,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing

Simon is married and has one son, Duncan. He purchases his clothing stock from Nairobi and Busia. Simon does not ascribe fixed prices to his clothes, but, in the tradition of most merchants in Kenya\u2019s markets, negotiates for each item. <P>\r\n\r\nThe challenges, he says, are stiff competition from other sellers and the ups and downs of Kenya\u2019s economy. It is hard to predict when people will have money here. This is Simon\u2019s first loan, and he plans to use it for more clothing stock and, if he can afford it, new sewing machines for tailoring. As an aside, I asked him who his favorite football team is. Breaking with most Kenyans, he said Barcelona FC instead of Manchester United. <P>\r\n\r\nIn this video, you can hear me greet Simon saying \"Idhi Nade\" -- which is Luo for \"How are you?\" Simon responds, \"Adhi maber,\" meaning \"very good.\" Most people living in Kisumu descend from the Luo tribe, the same tribe as Obama's father. At the end,  you will hear me fluctuate between Kiswahili and Luo saying \"Asante Sana\" in Kiswahili, meaning \"Thank you\" and Erokamano, which in Luo, means \"thank you.\" The voices you hear in the background are coming for a weekly K-MET borrower meeting. To see what one looks like, check out the first video in this blog post: http:\/\/fellowsblog.kiva.org\/2009\/05\/14\/m-banking\/ <P>\r\n\r\nK-MET, the NGO giving the loan, is unique in that it is not a traditional MFI. Rather, it is a development corporation focused on raising health standards in Kenya.

She sells cold drinks, gelatin, flan and homemade popsicles out of her home.  Her husband owns a small hardware store.

She invested her very first loan of 300 soles (about $100) in selling fruits.  Rosario plans to invest part of this loan of 1800 soles in her home-based dessert business.  She will also invest part of it in purchasing fish for sale together with her father.  Rosario\u2019s father buys fish in the small agricultural and fishing communities along the Ucayali, the wide brown river that flows past the city of Pucallpa and joins the Amazon to the north.  He then resells the fish in Pucallpa\u2019s port.\r\n\r\nRosario\u2019s loans from Manuela Ramos have enabled her to grow her business; she is now able to help her husband with household expenses.

Luego dice, que su esposo la dejo, pero que eso solo le ha servido para seguir adelante y ser una mujer m\u00e1s fuerte e independiente. ","en":"Cirila is a member of the Magnolia Communal Bank.  She is 52 years old, and she lives with her 19 year old daughter.  Her daughter has enrolled in the Universidad San Crist\u00f3bal in order to get her teaching degree.\r\n\r\nCirila sells eggs, ice cream, and gelatin in an itinerant manner.  She will use the loan to buy more merchandise from Lima.  During the July 28th festivities (Peruvian national holiday) Cirila will also sell fabric and metal rosettes. \r\n\r\nCirila remembers very well the day she became of member of FINCA Per\u00fa.  It was the 9th of December over 20 years ago, and there were only ten banks.  \u201cLa Morenita\u201d (The Virgen of Guadalupe) suggested joining FINCA Per\u00fa.  La Morenita told her \u201cdo not disappoint me, be punctual.\u201d  From that day on Cirila has always been punctual and responsible.\r\n\r\nShe had her first savings ready to buy a car.  However, her husband became ill, and they paid for his surgery.  Then, she says, her husband left her.  Nevertheless, this only served her to get ahead and to be a stronger and more independent woman.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":816769,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy seasonal products to sell.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":70,"posted_date":"2011-07-21T16:30:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Cirila ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-06-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2011-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2011-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2011-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.75},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.75},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.75},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":93.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":93.75,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:44:32Z","rounded_local_amount":257.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221666007},{"amount":93.75,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-19T08:03:49Z","rounded_local_amount":257.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227034808},{"amount":93.75,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T08:59:29Z","rounded_local_amount":257.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232795360},{"amount":93.75,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:10:38Z","rounded_local_amount":257.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238606191}],"funded_date":"2011-07-22T07:29:22Z","paid_date":"2011-11-15T10:10:38Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ginny Kalish"}},{"id":322502,"name":"Mamadrasul","description":{"languages":["ru","en"],"texts":{"ru":"\u041c\u0430\u043c\u0430\u0434\u0440\u0430\u0441\u0443\u043b \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0436\u0438\u0432\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u0432 \u0433\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0435 \u041a\u0443\u0440\u0433\u0430\u043d-\u0422\u044e\u0431\u0435. \u0415\u043c\u0443 53 \u0433\u043e\u0434\u0430. \u041e\u043d \u0436\u0435\u043d\u0430\u0442. \u0423 \u043d\u0435\u0433\u043e \u0434\u0432\u043e\u0435 \u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0439. \u0415\u0433\u043e \u0436\u0435\u043d\u0430 \u0434\u043e\u043c\u043e\u0445\u043e\u0437\u044f\u0439\u043a\u0430, \u0430 \u0441\u044b\u043d\u043e\u0432\u044c\u044f \u043d\u0430\u0445\u043e\u0434\u044f\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0432 \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0438. \u0421\u0430\u043c \u043e\u043d \u0438\u043c\u0435\u0435\u0442 \u0432\u044b\u0441\u0448\u0435\u0435 \u043f\u0435\u0434\u0430\u0433\u043e\u0433\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0435 \u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0437\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435. \u041e\u043d \u0431\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0435 8 \u043b\u0435\u0442 \u0437\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0442\u043e\u0440\u0433\u043e\u0432\u043b\u0435\u0439 \u043d\u0430 \u0440\u044b\u043d\u043a\u0435. \u0410\u0440\u0435\u043d\u0434\u0443\u0435\u0442 \u043f\u043e\u043c\u0435\u0449\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435, \u0433\u0434\u0435 \u043e\u0442\u043a\u0440\u044b\u043b \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0443\u043a\u0442\u043e\u0432\u044b\u0439 \u043c\u0430\u0433\u0430\u0437\u0438\u043d. \u041a\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0438\u0442 \u0431\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0442 \u0434\u043b\u044f \u043f\u043e\u043a\u0443\u043f\u043a\u0438 \u043a\u043e\u043d\u0444\u0435\u0442, \u0441\u0430\u0445\u0430\u0440\u0430, \u043c\u0443\u043a\u0438, \u0441\u043b\u0438\u0432\u043e\u0447\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043c\u0430\u0441\u043b\u0430 \u0438 \u043a\u043e\u043b\u0431\u0430\u0441\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u0438\u0437\u0434\u0435\u043b\u0438\u0439.","en":"Mamadrasul lives in the town of Qurgan-Tube.

They all live in the 'Darsalam de S\u00e9gou' neighbourhood (the fourth largest administrative area of Mali), and came to meet one another as parents, through marriage and through their trading activity in the market at  'M\u00e9dine de S\u00e9gou'.\r\nThe group members buy and sell jewelry (ear rings, chains, lipstick and hair colouring materials) shoes, handbags, logs for the fireplace and juices made from ginger and sorrel 'oseille de Guin\u00e9e'.\r\nWith a view to increasing their working capital and available cash, the group members applied to the microfinance institution Soro Yiriwaso and are now on their sixth collective loan. Madame Niamoye (second on the left, dressed in blue and white) plans to use the loan to buy raw materials to make regional juices (sugar, flavourings\/essences, ginger and Guinea sorrel (oseille de Guin\u00e9e)). In order to prepare the juices, she peels the ginger with a knife, washes it thoroughly, crushes it with a pestle and mortar, soaks it in water for at least two hours, and then mixes the liquid with the other ingredients before topping it up with fresh water to obtain the correct dilution. The resulting blend is placed into plastic sachets and chilled in the freezer ready for sale. \r\nThe juices are sold to a mixed customer base, for cash and credit, both from her home and at M\u00e9dine market. Madane Niamoye hopes to make an average 40,000 CFA profit monthly with this loan, which will be used for savings, and re-invested in the business, as well as to cover the family's day to day basic needs. Her goal is to purchase a large freezer so she can grow the scale of her business through this partnership with Soro Yiriwaso.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1525,"image":{"id":929664,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Soft Drinks","sector":"Food","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"to buy ingredients for the preparation of regional juice specialities","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"S\u00e9gou","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2011-11-25T13:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1525,"lender_count":49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kadiatou                              ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Coumba                             ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Oumou      Batara    ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Niamoye                              ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Aminata                                 ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-11-16T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":750000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2012-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2012-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2012-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2012-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2012-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":125000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":254.17},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":254.16},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":254.17},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":254.17},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":254.16},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":254.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":254.17,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2011-12-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T11:22:53Z","rounded_local_amount":125251.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250874391},{"amount":254.16,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2012-01-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:48:15Z","rounded_local_amount":125251.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257283215},{"amount":254.17,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2012-02-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-30T08:04:33Z","rounded_local_amount":125251.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263424724},{"amount":254.17,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2012-03-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-11T08:20:16Z","rounded_local_amount":125251.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270139990},{"amount":254.16,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2012-04-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-25T08:52:05Z","rounded_local_amount":125251.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276756963},{"amount":254.17,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2012-05-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-16T09:08:29Z","rounded_local_amount":125251.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283251736}],"funded_date":"2011-11-25T19:17:49Z","paid_date":"2012-06-16T09:08:29Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Alistair Assheton","image":1674519}},{"id":371708,"name":"Henrietta F.'s Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Pictured here are teachers from one of the secondary schools in Lunsar, a town in Northern Sierra Leone.

She started working when she was a child.\n\nJosefina is excited to be taking her 3rd loan with Esperanza after having successfully repaid her previous loan and grown her business. She plans to use this loan to invest in her business by buying beans to cook and sell every morning to her neighbors. She also want to buy household products and silver jewelry to sell from home and by walking to sell in the afternoons.\n\nJosefina will use the profits to invest in her business. Her dream is to give her children a healthy life full of opportunities. In the meantime she plans to continue enjoying her work.\n\nThis Esperanza associate\u2019s story is representative of her group and of Esperanza's Haitian and Dominican  clients generally (many of whom recently emigrated to the Dominican Republic from Haiti). Her group is located in the urban slums surrounding Santo Domingo. This area, like nearly all impoverished areas of the Dominican Republic, suffers from unreliable electricity and running water (none of which is potable).\n\nThe sixth woman is named Ana (the one

She earns her living by operating three business ventures: a general store , an RTW (Ready-To-Wear) clothing business and a pig-fattening business. Her husband, Alex B., who is 41 years old, works as a farmer to earn his living and also helps in his wife's business activities. They have two children who are 7 and 9 years old.\r\n\r\nRita joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2003 because she wished for something better for her family. With the help of her past ten loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, she has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 28,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 4,000, thus uplifting her family's standard of living.\r\n\r\nThis time, for her 11th loan, Rita is borrowing PHP 29,500 which she intends to use to buy more stock for her general store so that she can continue to save for the future of her family.\r\n\r\nRita is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>About NWTF:<\/b>\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress out of earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.\r\n\r\nHelp NWTF continue in its mission to help the poorest in the Philippines by visiting the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.kiva.org\/team\/nwtf_philippines\" target=\"_blank\">NWTF lending team<\/a>

With the help of her past four loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Cristina has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. \r\n\r\nHer previous loan of PHP 10,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 8,000, uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her fifth loan, she is borrowing PHP 20,000, which she intends to use to buy more stocks for the grocery store so that she could expand into produce business.

Eliza keeps and sells chickens, working at the business for 1-4 hours per day, 7 days per week and is assisted by one employee. Eliza currently earns about 90 USD a month from her business. She is requesting a loan in order to increase number of chickens in her project. In the future, she plans to move the business to a new location. Eliza thanks you for your support!\r\n\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":319821,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Veterinary Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To increase number of chickens in her project","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbeya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.9 33.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-05-15T19:00:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elza\t ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-05-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":500000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":375}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":375,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2010-05-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-10T13:05:50Z","rounded_local_amount":503062.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144773293}],"funded_date":"2009-05-16T00:45:21Z","paid_date":"2010-12-10T13:05:50Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Nobles Microfinance Club","image":130048}},{"id":112709,"name":"Eulalia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Eulalia is a native of Cabgan, Punta Miray, Baliangao, Mis.

Her husband is an engineer, and together they were able to build a house for their family. Now, Paola has her own business selling used clothing, which she buys by the bundle. A variety of nice clothing comes in each bundle, and she sells each item for a fair price. She started the business with her own money, with hopes of generating her own income in order to continue to support her children as best she could. Though her children are now independent, she still wants to help provide her grandchildren with an education. She has been able to grow her client base, bit by bit, and so is looking to buy more bundles of clothing in order to catch the eye of more new clients. She is pleased with the opportunity to take out this loan, and hopes to sell more merchandise so that she can earn more money. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Cynthia McMurry, Kiva

He is 50 years old, married and the father of 5 children, ages 20,17, 15, 9 and 6.  The four youngest children go to school.  Jeremias finished seventh grade but did not continue because he was drafted into military service.  He lives in his own house with his family and does not support anyone other than his children.\r\n\r\nHe left Manjacaze to go to Boane after his discharge from the military in 1987, and he came in search of a job and better living conditions.  For more than eleven years he has worked for a security company.  He has no employees and earns a salary of 4,817 meticais, plus another 5,000 meticais per month from his own business.  He uses this money for household expenses and also manages to save some in his bank account.\r\n\r\nJeremias has never had loans from other banks.

Ana is seeking a loan to buy agricultural supplies, such as manure and fertilizers, for growing corn. This will enable her to fertilize her crops and obtain a better yield.\r\n\r\nAna\u2019s goals are to fulfill her loan obligations and continue working. She would like to increase the area under cultivation to improve the profitability of the business and contribute to bettering the quality of life for her family.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jeffrey Hersk, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":571071,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"agricultural supplies such as manure and fertilizer","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Canton Monte Grande, San Miguel","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":167,"posted_date":"2010-07-22T15:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":300,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ana Aracely","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-07-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":300,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":21.69},{"due_date":"2010-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":22.23},{"due_date":"2010-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":22.99},{"due_date":"2010-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":23.17},{"due_date":"2010-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":24.28},{"due_date":"2011-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":24.54},{"due_date":"2011-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":25.16},{"due_date":"2011-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":26.11},{"due_date":"2011-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":26.44},{"due_date":"2011-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":27.16},{"due_date":"2011-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":27.78},{"due_date":"2011-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":28.45}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.69},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.23},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.99},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.17},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":24.28},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":24.54},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.16},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.11},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.44},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.16},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.78},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.45}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":22.01,"local_amount":22.01,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:44:02Z","rounded_local_amount":22.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166894913},{"amount":27.06,"local_amount":27.06,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:29:47Z","rounded_local_amount":27.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172162933},{"amount":26.98,"local_amount":26.98,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T15:26:06Z","rounded_local_amount":26.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177458811},{"amount":38.52,"local_amount":38.52,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-19T10:11:59Z","rounded_local_amount":38.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":189181593},{"amount":25.91,"local_amount":25.91,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T04:55:27Z","rounded_local_amount":25.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191474429},{"amount":49.83,"local_amount":49.83,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:49:41Z","rounded_local_amount":49.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201339596},{"amount":26.93,"local_amount":26.93,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:39:41Z","rounded_local_amount":26.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206209618},{"amount":82.76,"local_amount":82.76,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T09:21:12Z","rounded_local_amount":82.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221734880}],"funded_date":"2010-07-22T16:31:34Z","paid_date":"2011-08-15T09:21:12Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"jeff hersk","image":384019}},{"id":220085,"name":"Eden","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Eden D. is from the village of Agay-ayan, Gingoog City.

This will be her 14th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 18,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey towards economic freedom.

Maligaya, Brgy. Magara, Roxas, Palawan. She earns her living by operating 3 business ventures:   buying & selling \"pawid\" made of nipa,  buying & selling fish and a general store businesses.  Her husband Ferdinand A., who is 40 years old, works as a farmer to earn his living and also helps in his wife's business activities.  They have 6 children who are 3 to 20 years old. \r\n\r\nGilda joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2005 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 8 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Gilda has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 15,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 8,000, thus uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 9th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 17,000 which she intends to use as additional capital for her business so that she could continue to save up for the future education of her children and fulfill her plans of buying a photocopying machine. \r\n\r\nGilda A. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from preparing and selling cooked food for daily meals. Magdalina has been engaged in her business for more than three years and earns approximately 1,500 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2011, Magdalina joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Magdalina is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase raw ingredients needed to cook food for sale. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Magdalina from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.

She is 63 years old and lives happily with her husband in her own house. For more than 50 years she has been engaging in embroidery, trimming the typical dresses of her region: she owes the wiD. experience she has in this art to her mother, who also taught her how to till the land and to breed animals. Thus she works alone day by day in her own house, but there are times when she needs to pay for workhands to help her in her production: her embroidery workshop is renowned and considered prestigious in her area, something that favors her by granting her recurring customers. She thinks her job is profitable because her customers are willing to pay what she asks, considering it to be fair seeing the quality and finish she offers. On top of this she also engages in agriculture, and every 6 months she returns to her lands to harvest. She says she will always engage in her job, and for this reason she has put her mind to increasing the knitting production, as she has more embroidery requests and wants to satisfy them on time. This is her thirds loan with MFP through the group loans of her communal bank. She likes meeting up with her group and share experiences, and for this reason she believes her team to be sound and to be working in unity. Showing the same determination, she has decided she will invest the loan in the purchase of more materials for her embroidery, such as fabric and threads in different colors.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":789050,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Embroidery","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"To buy fabric and threads in different colors.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"HUANCAYO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.066667 -75.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-06-14T22:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Albina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-06-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":375}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":375,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:50:34Z","rounded_local_amount":1038.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250835434}],"funded_date":"2011-06-15T05:08:17Z","paid_date":"2012-01-15T10:50:34Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Emanuela Villa","image":625792}},{"id":310240,"name":"1 Ch\u1ee3 \u0110i\u1ec7n Bi\u00ean Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Thu\u00fd is 42 years old and is married with three children.

He lives in Biet Lahia, which is located in the Gaza Strip, in Palestine. He is a Palestinian National Authority employee with a decent salary.\r\n\r\nMosa wants to replace his old home furniture with new furniture such as beds for his children and seating for the living room in order to provide better living conditions for his family. He does not have enough money to pay for the furniture, so he needs to take out a loan from FATEN. When he gets the loan, which will be repaid on a monthly basis, he will purchase the new furniture. Mosa was photographed at the FATEN branch.\r\n\r\nAbout this loan product:\r\n\r\nFATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see requested includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

From there, she began doing work for neighbors and, little by little, her customer base grew and business has been strong.\r\n<p>\r\nSusana is applying for a US$300 loan, to be repaid in 3 months, so that she can buy materials that will allow her to fill the orders that her customers have placed for things such as bedspreads, quilts, pillows, towel sets, etc. and so that she can provide good service and complete the orders on time.\r\n<p><b>Translated from Spanish by Jere Wiseman, Kiva Volunteer<\/b><p>\r\nSusana R. se considera una persona muy trabajadora y responsable esta casada con el  Sr. Luis Terrazas N\u00fa\u00f1ez de 32 a\u00f1os, tiene 2 hijos Luis Fernando de 8 a\u00f1os y V\u00edctor Manuel de 6 a\u00f1os estudiantes de primaria.

He has been doing this kind of work for a very long time for he comes from a family with an entirely agricultural background and now he is in charge of handing down all that experience to his children. Today Mamur wishes to increase the number of his cattle. He would like to buy cows with the hope of increasing his income and the well-being of his home.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The group photograph was taken at Yanet\u2019s business, so we can see that she has been improving over time.  Yanet has been able to pay for her family\u2019s expenses and help one of her daughters earn her pharmacy degree.  She is currently supporting her youngest daughter who is studying information technology, paying for her own osteoporosis medication, and constructing a bathroom with solid materials.  The loan she is requesting will be used to purchase soft drinks and candy.  Part of the proceeds will also be used to pay for her daughter\u2019s college registration fees.\r\n<p>\r\nMar\u00eda is in a common law marriage and has two children, ages 20 and 7.  She sells candy from home and also shares the household expenses with her husband, who works as a small-time debt collector.  However, there are times when he does not have work.  The loans she has received have been used to buy soft drinks, cookies, and detergents.  Her earnings have been steady.  The community has given Mar\u00eda the responsibility of releasing the water in the mornings.  Her loan will be used to purchase cookies and soft drinks.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1825,"image":{"id":461648,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Operating capital","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":93,"posted_date":"2010-01-01T09:20:13Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1825,"lender_count":45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lucila Petronila","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yanet Rosaura","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Karin Llesenia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Jimmy Abel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Olivia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Timoteo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Luzmila Meri","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Maria Eugenia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nancy Dina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yuli Manuela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marcial Paulo ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Evelyn Amelia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-12-18T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":5250,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":1825,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":1312.5},{"due_date":"2010-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":1312.5},{"due_date":"2010-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1312.5},{"due_date":"2010-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1312.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":456.25},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":456.25},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":456.25},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":456.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":456.42,"local_amount":1313,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:15:35Z","rounded_local_amount":1319.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118064633},{"amount":456.08,"local_amount":1312,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T09:46:17Z","rounded_local_amount":1318.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123899692},{"amount":456.42,"local_amount":1313,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T08:44:42Z","rounded_local_amount":1319.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128933775},{"amount":456.08,"local_amount":1312,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:07:56Z","rounded_local_amount":1318.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136661368}],"funded_date":"2010-01-15T14:21:40Z","paid_date":"2010-05-15T10:07:56Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ronan Reodica","image":498323}},{"id":170376,"name":"Ali","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ali has owned a cleaning company since 1993.

She is 31 years old, married, and is the mother of 2 children who are 10 and 4 years old. The 10 year old attends school. Luisa only studied through 5th grade and didn't continue because of a lack of financial resources, but she would like to continue studying in adult literacy classes. She lives in her own home with her family and has helped to support her siblings with school materials and medical care.\r\n\r\nLuisa never left Boane, she only leaves for one or two day shopping trips. She began working in 1987, when she was still very young, because of the difficult life that her family was facing. She now owns her own business, works around 12 hours a day, and doesn't have any other employees. Her husband, who works as a gardener for a company that grows and sells bananas, sometimes helps her with the business. Luisa earns 4500.00 Meticales per month on average. She uses this money to pay for household expenses, and also saves some money at home each month for any additional expenditures that might arise.\r\n\r\nLuisa had taken out loans before with the PROCREDIT credit cooperative, but she decided not to continue for various reasons.

Lunas, Barangay Kawit, Medellin, Cebu City. She earns her living by operating three business ventures: General Store, Food Vending and Livestock Vending businesses. Her common law husband Serafio Mondejar, who is 53 years old, works as a electrician to earn his living.  She has six children who are between 18 and 33 years old. \r\n\r\nEsperanza joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2009 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past three loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Esperanza has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 8,000 PHP helped her earn a monthly profit of about $360, raising the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 4th cycle loan, she is borrowing 10,000 PHP, which she intends to use to purchase goods to sell so that she can continue to save up for future business expansion. Esperanza I. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She is married to A. A. who is a cobbler by profession. He makes shoes on order for different shoe factories. Those factories provide him raw materials for making shoes but in this way he only earns the laboring cost, which is not enough to meet the expenses of his family. That is why he has decided to buy the raw materials for himself and start to sell the finished products to these factories. In this way he can make more money and improve the financial situation of his family. \r\n\r\nTherefore, Farzana has applied for a loan from Kiva partner, Asasah, for her husband. He will invest the loan in purchasing raw materials such as nails, leather, shoe polish, etc. in bulk that will enable him to make shoes in larger quantity to sell to the factories. \r\n\r\nFarzana is hopeful that by utilizing the loan money, her husband\u2019s income will be increased and she will be able to provide better living facilities to her large family of 8 children.   Both of her sons do labor and her daughters stay at home. She is a regular loan user of Asasah and this is her 2nd loan application.

They have two children who are 18 and 19 years old, one already with their own family, the other attending school. <p>\r\n\r\nMarivic joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2003 because she aspired to something better for her family. With the help of her past 12 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, she has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 18,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 3,000, thus uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 13th loan, she is borrowing PHP 15,000 as additional funds for her business operations so that she can continue to save up for future business expansion.  Marivic is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.  <p>\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

Her entire family works daily on the fertilizing their cultivation fields. Although agricultural work is hard and arduous work she says that she very much enjoys it because it helps her to always have food for her family, although there are still some difficult times. The harvesting of vegetables is the most profitable although she also cultivates potatoes. For this reason she intensifies her efforts to produce a greater yield of these products. She earns a good profit with these products in her community market. In the future she wants to acquire further extensions to her land where she will continue to produce potatoes and vegetables.

Bernardina has capitalized on this market and everyday she travels to a different location to set up her stand and sell to the communities. She loads her giant wicker basket with fresh fruits and vegetables. She and her husband even bake bread in a rented oven near their home, which she also loads up to sell in the country. \r\n\r\nThis type of job is extremely strenuous and tiring. Bernardina wakes up every morning at 4 a.m. and sometimes doesn\u2019t return home until after 8 p.m. However strenuous her vocation, it is necessary, as she is supporting her entire family of 5 children and her husband with her meager income. Years before, Bernardina\u2019s husband also had a job and worked very hard. However, he fell gravely ill and is now unable to perform manual labor. Thus, Bernardina bears the family\u2019s economic burden on her own. She is highly motivated though. She has been saving diligently in order to reach the goal of educating all five of her children in obtaining a university degree. Without the economic help Bernardina has received through her village bank and the support of her family, realization of her dreams would be nearly impossible. Bernardina is requesting a loan of $350. With this money, she will be able to buy larger quantities of fruits and vegetables as well as bake larger quantities of bread."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":94244,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To buy larger quantities of fruits and vegetables as well as bake larger quantities of bread","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":70,"posted_date":"2007-12-08T07:15:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"lender_count":1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Bernardina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-12-22T07:40:42Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2008-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2008-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2008-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":88,"local_amount":251.43,"processed_date":"2008-01-22T10:15:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-22T09:36:10Z","rounded_local_amount":262.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":120119},{"amount":88,"local_amount":251.43,"processed_date":"2008-02-22T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-22T09:36:10Z","rounded_local_amount":262.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":140282},{"amount":88,"local_amount":251.43,"processed_date":"2008-03-22T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-22T09:36:10Z","rounded_local_amount":262.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":163851},{"amount":86,"local_amount":245.71,"processed_date":"2008-04-22T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-22T09:36:10Z","rounded_local_amount":256.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188840}],"funded_date":"2007-12-08T07:40:42Z","paid_date":"2008-04-22T09:10:07Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":30798,"name":"Elinah's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Elinah is 30 years old and is married with 6 children.

She is a widow with five children. When her husband passed away, she was left without any steady income. Supporting this large family on her own was very difficult. Struggling against the difficult life, Olima learned to process dried fruits and clingstone apricots 9 years ago. The business went along successfully after it started. <P>\r\n\r\nThanks to this activity she has been able to open a grocery store near her house where her daughter sells foodstuffs. Her elder son left for Russia two years ago to try to earn some money.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.
