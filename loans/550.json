She and her husband live in their own home with their three young children. Raymunda makes polo shirts for a living. At her dining room table, she traces patterns, cuts fabric pieces and sorts them. Raymunda does her best to cut every piece precisely, and then she takes them to her friend's shop, where they are sewn and finished. Her favourite part of her job is designing the shirts. She has been making shirts for two years; it's difficult work, and she doesn't have the right materials to continue doing it properly. In the future, she plans to buy a sewing machine and open her own clothing shop. This is her first MFP loan; she has agreed to make her payments on time, and considers it good for her business. Raymunda will use her loan to buy wholesale fabrics so that she can make more polo shirts and fill her orders on time. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Corinne Gilroy, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":900,"image":{"id":529570,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cloth & Dressmaking Supplies","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Buying fabric for making shirts.

a TV & Refrigerator repair shop, Farming and a General Store business. She lives in T. Alonzo St., Poblacion, Madredijos, Cebu City. \r\n\r\nShe has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2000 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her TV & Refrigerator repair shop, Farming and General Store businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP5,000. \r\n\r\nLydia is now borrowing PHP 23,000 so that she could use it to purchase additional materials for her business. This will be her 18th cycle loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP20,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey towards economic freedom. Lydia aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well being by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nShown in photo: Lydia together with her husband in her shop. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

He lives with his parents, and his greatest desire is to get ahead in life.  Abraham grows peas, potatoes, and corn, leaving the house early every day to work in his fields.  His only goal is to strive so that his crops will be good.  What he likes most about his job is caring for his land.  He has done this work for 6 years, and finds that the hardest part is protecting his land from infestation by the insects attracted to his crops.  In time, he hopes to sow more and thus have higher production.  This is his first loan with MFP.  He is aware that he must pay the installments punctually if he is to secure another loan.

She shares one room with her children  She lives in Elemighong, one of the  quarters found in Belo Sub Division, North West Region, Cameroon.\n\nBridget has encountered a lot of difficulties in life, for example, difficulty in having three square meals a day. Ill health has also been one of her problems, She has been unable to have good medical treatment because she has no money. She joined GHAPE because she  had heard and seen a lot of people testify about GHAPE and she believes her life will not be the same if this loan is given to her . \n\nBridget plans to buy a good quantity of castle oil(this is a medicinal oil used for the treatment of skin diseases and and also used as food). She is going to use the profit from the loan to increase her capital. Her community and family will benefit from the trade because she will provide them with castle oil at very low prices. Her activity will help reduce distance from members of her community and it will be available at all times. Bridget says \u201cher children will all be well educated\u201d.\n\nShe prefers GHAPE because of the training she frequently receives, the follow up, and also that GHAPE does not ask for collateral security, and the because of the low cost in obtaining and paying back a loan. GHAPE takes care of the poor and repayment is gradual. \n\nAbout GHAPE \n\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon.  GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach.  Every client is trained in business management, basic health, life skills, financial management, profits and losses, and family values.  Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement.  GHAPE instils a sense of family and community within its clients and staff and has developed a strong bond of trust between the organization and its clients.\n\n"}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":789732,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy castle oil for resale.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CM","country":"Cameroon","town":"Elemighong Belo Sub Division","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"6 12","type":"point"}},"partner_id":40,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":225,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":" Bridget ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-06-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XAF","disbursal_amount":95000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":3958.33},{"due_date":"2011-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":3958.33},{"due_date":"2011-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":3958.33},{"due_date":"2011-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":3958.33},{"due_date":"2011-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":3958.33},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":3958.33},{"due_date":"2011-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":3958.33},{"due_date":"2011-09-29T07:00:00Z","amount":3958.33},{"due_date":"2011-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":3958.33},{"due_date":"2011-10-27T07:00:00Z","amount":3958.33},{"due_date":"2011-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":3958.33},{"due_date":"2011-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":3958.33},{"due_date":"2011-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":3958.33},{"due_date":"2011-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":3958.33},{"due_date":"2012-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":3958.33},{"due_date":"2012-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":3958.33},{"due_date":"2012-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":3958.33},{"due_date":"2012-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":3958.33},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":3958.33},{"due_date":"2012-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":3958.33},{"due_date":"2012-03-29T07:00:00Z","amount":3958.33},{"due_date":"2012-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":3958.33},{"due_date":"2012-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":3958.33},{"due_date":"2012-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":3958.41}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9.37},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9.38},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9.37},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9.38},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9.37},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9.38},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9.37},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9.38},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":9.37},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":9.38},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":9.37},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":9.38},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":9.37},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":9.38},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":9.37},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":9.38},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9.37},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9.38},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9.37},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9.38},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9.37},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9.38},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9.37},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9.38}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":310454,"name":"Pao","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Pao, 39, is a married woman and the mother of four unmarried children.

He makes the milk into cheese, yogurt, butter, and other dairy products. His family helps him with sales and with caring for these generous cows because it is thanks to the income they generate that the family is able to satisfy its basic needs. <p>Oswaldo wants to improve the barn so that the cows can have a more comfortable place to live. In this way he can thank each one of them for the happiness they have provided his family for such a long time. For this reason, Oswaldo is requesting a loan of $100.00, which he is committed to repaying over a period of 6 months.

Usmonkul aspires to have more farming equipment and supplies so that he can work his land much more productively. Only due to lack of funds has he not been able to do so.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, and Central Asian traditions. But Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

(second from left) is a hardworking mother of three who sells used clothing to make a living.  She sells what is called \u201cropa de paca,\" which is pre-made bundles of used clothing from the United States and other countries, organized into bags such as men\u2019s clothing, women\u2019s clothing and bedsheets.  Juana travels to cities up to five hours away from her home in Saman\u00e1 to purchase the clothing she sells to those in her neighborhood.\r\n<p>\r\nTeresa works from her home, where she lives with her husband and three children, ages 14, 10 and 4.  Her customers drop by with orders and requests, and Teresa happily finds the necessary clothing when she purchases inventory.  Currently on her eighth loan with Esperanza International, Teresa has proven to be a determined and responsible businesswoman.  Recognizing the oversaturation of some other types of businesses, she decided to enter into clothing sales, where she has found sales to be brisk.\r\n<p>\r\nMany of Teresa\u2019s profits go to feeding her children.  With five people living at home, her husband\u2019s salary as a boat driver is not sufficient to provide everything necessary for the family.  Now, with Teresa augmenting the family\u2019s income, all are comfortably fed and clothed.\r\n<p>\r\nIn the future, Teresa dreams of having her own store from which she can sell her clothing and other goods.  As well, when her children reach college age, she hopes to support their education at a local university.\r\n<p>\r\nThank you for your Kiva loan to Teresa and the other members of her

The majority of the members are from the neighborhood of Narancay from the Ba\u00f1os parish in the City of  Cuenca.  Ba\u00f1os is known for its hot springs that emanate from a volcano.  There are festivals throughout the month of January with several activities such as dances and artist showcases and festivals featuring timbulo (a sweet tamale wrapped in corn leaf) and other foods.  Few of the inhabitants work in agriculture because, for the most part, they work serving the large quantity of tourists who come to get to know this beautiful place.\r\n\r\nThe members tell their stories with characteristic friendliness.  Se\u00f1ora Mar\u00eda Natividad P. T. is a member of the Las Lucecitas bank.  She lives in Narancay, some 15 minutes outside the City of Cuenca.  She is 39 years old, married, and has 5 children, aged 18, 16, 14, 12, 1.  Her older children study in the Manuel C\u00f3rdova Galarza Technical College located in her parish.  She and her family live in their own home, the fruits of the efforts of Se\u00f1ora Mar\u00eda and her spouse.  Her husband is a carpenter, and he is the best life partner, as well as the best example for their children.  For 10 years Mar\u00eda has worked in agriculture, raising chickens, guinea pigs, and pigs.  The family consumes the majority of her output, and she sells a small amount in the free market in Cuenca, also selling chickens on foot, or plucked to acquaintances who buy in the house; she also sells them in the stores in her area.\r\n\r\nThis is her third loan cycle with the foundation and she is grateful because they have helped stabilize her economically because before she had to borrow from informal lenders at very high rates of interest.  With the loan that the ESPOIR foundation is granting her, she will buy more chickens, guinea pigs, pigs, animal food and vitamins to continue to grow her business.  Her goal is to eventually buy a car in order to increase her sales and collect more customers. \r\n\r\nSe\u00f1ora Mar\u00eda Cristina Mej\u00eda P. is a new member of the communal bank.  Her mother-in-law is a member of the bank and invited her to become a member. She lives in the community of Guzho, some 15 minutes outside the City of Cuenca.  She is 23 years old, has been married for 5 years, and has two children: a 4-year old and a 2-year old.  Her husband is a driver in public transportation.  Maria is starting with the business of raising chickens.  She tells us that it is not too complicated, to obtain the desired earnings you just have to be attentive so that the animals do not lack food or water and have adequate shelter so that they do not die.  This is her first credit with the ESPOIR foundation and she hopes to continue to take out loans so that she can improve her quality of life and that of her family.  With this loan she will purchase more chickens, animal food and vitamins, and also she will use a part of the loan to finish her house.  The goal of Maria is to finish her house with the loans that the foundation grants.\r\n\r\nSe\u00f1ora Sindy Gissela Mor\u00e1n C. is another active member of the communal bank Las Lucecitas.  She lives in the City of Cuenca, is eighteen years old, and is married.  Although she has no children, she has a solid matrimonial relationship, telling us that in order to have a consistent relationship one must be friends above all and have excellent communication. Her husband is an electrician and they live in a rented home and would like to improve their economic situation.  Sindy sells shoes, she has been involved in this activity for a year and it's going very well because she has a good supply of good quality shoes.  She is an informal trader in the Cuenca free market, which runs daily.  She works from 8am to 6pm and on weekends goes to the markets in Sigsig, Azogues, and Paute where she works from 5 a.m. to 6 p.m.  This is her first loan, a friend convinced her to become part of the bank by telling her about the advantages that the foundation offers.  With the loan she is requesting she will buy more merchandise and this way will have an increased inventory of shoes for women, men and children.  Her dream is to have her own stall, so that she would not have to travel around the city to sell her goods.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Lisa Grobar, Kiva

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 percent of the country is mountainous and only 7 percent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition.

Alicia M., 53, knows this, and gives her best to accomplish the goals she has set for herself and her family. She finished a two-year secretarial course and is a proud mother of two children who are now in high school and elementary school. She is a single mother and gives all her best as a variety store owner to sustain their living. Together, they live in Pasay City, Philippines.\r\n\r\nAlicia presently runs a sari-sari (variety) store that caters to needs that are more immediate than the nearest grocery in the community. Alicia has operated from home for five years now, and has gained regular customers who keep her business alive. She employs no one, and earns 10,000 Philippines pesos (PHP) a month.\r\n\r\nBecause her goal is to level up her business, she decided to borrow 27,000 PHP. She will use this to buy goods that her customers prefer. She will see to it that her store will not lack any valuable thing that her customers need, so that they will make hers their number one sari-sari store in the community.\r\n\r\nAlicia has learned the value of improving one\u2019s business, and thus works to innovate hers. She does not emphasize any problem she encounters but rather focuses on its solution. Goals cannot be met just by identifying the problem, but by acting on them. One most important goal she has in mind is to support her children until their college graduation, with which she will feel most fulfilled.\r\n\r\nAs CCT community partner, she faithfully attends their weekly fellowship* meeting, where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she received.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance loans.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":703178,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

She and her husband Bejamine, who works as a vendor, have five children. She and Benjamine share the responsibility in attending to their young children while at the same time earning an income to provide for their daily needs. \r\n\r\nDarlyn is a Balut vendor. In the Philippines, Balut is well-known egg snack that is sold on the sidewalk. It is a duck egg boiled with a delicious small amount of soup inside. It is highly nutritious food that Filipinos love to eat, especially when they feel tired, as it revitalizes energy and strength. About 450 to 600 Balut eggs are boiled and sold every night. She and her husband not only prepare these eggs but also do the selling, which means they do not need to pay commissions to vendors to sell the eggs. They earn 300 Philippine Pesos (PhP) in sales per day.  \r\n\r\nDarlyn is requesting a loan amounting to Php 10,000 that she will use as start-up capital for her additional business, which will involve selling fried chicken skin and quail eggs. There is a high demand for fried chicken skin and Darlyn wants to give it a try since her stall is located in a crowded and busy area. The remaining amount will be spent on purchasing additional Balut eggs.\r\n\r\nDarlyn dreams of having a stall located in the market. She still has to wait a little longer to make this dream come true because she needs to prioritize being a mother to her young children. For now, Darlyn and her husband will continue to depend on to each other to make their small business grow for the sake of their children\u2019s future. \r\n\r\nDarlyn never fails to attend weekly fellowship* as it inspires her to go on with her life no matter what the obstacles might be, because she has faith in a God Who she believes will never fail her. \r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":896776,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Balut-Making","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy additional stocks of Balut and to add new food items to her business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Batasan, Quezon City","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2011-10-22T16:30:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":250,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Darlyn","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-09-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-10-27T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-12-29T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":666.62}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":2667,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T09:37:18Z","rounded_local_amount":2882.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238571877},{"amount":66.66,"local_amount":2666,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:31:57Z","rounded_local_amount":2881.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244529427},{"amount":83.34,"local_amount":3334,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T09:39:35Z","rounded_local_amount":3603.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250738643},{"amount":33.33,"local_amount":1333,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T09:48:15Z","rounded_local_amount":1440.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257145871}],"funded_date":"2011-10-22T19:06:35Z","paid_date":"2012-02-15T09:48:15Z","journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Maeve","image":1271729}},{"id":351482,"name":"Alice","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Alice is 63 years old and is married to Thomas.

Group","description":{"languages":["es"],"texts":{"es":"<P>The women of the Jorge\u00f1itas group come from the beautiful town of San Jorge la Laguna, a town located at the edges of the beautiful lake of Atitl\u00e1n.  These women reflect at first sight a confidence that calls your attention, so that while conducting the interview I was discovering the reason for this confidence.  \r\n\r\n<P>The great majority are artisans and they work making necklaces of jewels.  They produce beautiful earrings, bracelets, and necklaces with pearlites imported from the Czech Republic.  Some say that this art of making necklaces was imported to lake Atitl\u00e1n by European artisans several decades ago.  There are also women who invest their capital in small convenience stores and knitting machines.  They buy thread to create beautiful Guatemalan embroidered dresses and traditional blouses.  \r\n\r\n<P>When the artisans begin to share how they are going to invest their loans one can realize the dimension of their businesses.  The jewelers revealed that with the loan that they are going to receive they were going to buy the materials for the necklaces by the kilogram, while the great majority of artisans buy the materials for necklaces by the ounce.  This reflects that they are in a little more advanced phase of business development, since the quantity of commodity that they are going to buy is a lot greater than that of the majority of artisans around la Laguna.  \r\n\r\n<P>The Jorge\u00f1itas have been working with Friendship Bridge for more than a year and they have benefited from the training given by the loan agents.  The women commented that they were interested a lot in the themes of saving money, natural medicine and especially family planning.  They mentioned what a large impact it had on them to know that a woman is able and has the authority to plan the size of her family.  \r\n\r\n<P>Also they mentioned that they like to work with microfinance institutions, especially with Friendship Bridge, because they ask few requirements, the disbursements are fast and they help them with their business.  If you contribute to the success of these artisans then they are going to be able to continue developing their qualities as businesswomen and artisans.  \r\n<p> <b>Translated from Spanish by B, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n<P>Las mujeres del grupo Jorge\u00f1itas provienen del bello pueblo de San Jorge la Laguna. Un pueblo ubicado a las orillas del hermoso lago de Atitl\u00e1n. Estas mujeres reflejan a primera vista una confianza que llama la atenci\u00f3n, conforme fue transcurriendo la entrevista fui descubriendo el porque de esta confianza. \r\n\r\n<P>La gran mayor\u00eda son artesanas y trabajan elaborando joyas de mostacilla. Ellas producen hermosos aretes, brazaletes, collares con perlitas de mostacillas importadas de la Rep\u00fablica Checa. Algunos dicen que este arte de la mostacilla fue importado al lago Atitl\u00e1n por artesanos Europeos hace ya varias d\u00e9cadas. Tambi\u00e9n se encuentran mujeres que invierten su capital en peque\u00f1as tiendas de conveniencia y tejedoras que compran hilo para elaborar bellos huipiles Guatemaltecos, blusas tradicionales. \r\n\r\n<P>Cuando las artesanas empezaron a compartir en que van a invertir su cr\u00e9dito uno se puede dar cuenta de la dimensi\u00f3n de su empresa. Las joyeras revelaron que con el pr\u00e9stamo que van a recibir iban a comprar las bolsas de mostacilla por kilo, mientras la gran mayor\u00eda de artesanas compran la mostacilla por onzas. Esto refleja que ellas est\u00e1n en una etapa de desarrollo empresarial un poco m\u00e1s avanzada, ya que la cantidad de materia prima que van a comprar es mucho mayor al de la mayor\u00eda de artesanas alrededor de la laguna. \r\n\r\n<P>Las Jorge\u00f1itas han venido trabajando con Friendship Bridge por m\u00e1s de un a\u00f1o y se han beneficiado con las capacitaciones impartidas por las agentes de cr\u00e9dito. Las mujeres comentaban que a ellas les interesaron mucho los temas de ahorro del dinero, medicina natural y especialmente planificaci\u00f3n familiar. Ellas mencionaron que les caus\u00f3 un impacto grande el hecho de conocer que una mujer puede y tiene la autorizaci\u00f3n de planificar el tama\u00f1o de su familia. \r\n\r\n<P>Tambi\u00e9n mencionaron que les gusta trabajar con las instituciones de microfinanzas, especialmente con Friendship Bridge porque piden pocos requisitos, los desembolsos son r\u00e1pidos y las ayudan con sus negocios. Si ustedes contribuyen con el \u00e9xito de estas artesanas entonces ellas van a poder seguir desarrollando sus cualidades como empresarias y artesanas."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2975,"image":{"id":156513,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"To

However, the loan is now helping her stock both soft drinks and alcohol. She is so excited to be able to replace the home-boiled drinking water that she used to sell to her customers cheaply with bottled mineral water that she buys in cartons from various beverage companies. \r\n\r\nMarried with four children between ages of 8 and 10, she works tirelessly to ensure that her children's needs are met. She hopes that, with a good turn of events, she will one day open a large wholesale shop offering a variety of fast-moving consumer goods to retailers. With enough savings, she will, no doubt, build a modern residence and ensure that her children get the best education.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":241186,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Purchase soft drinks and alcohol.

loan. She was able to repay the full amount of her last loan on time. Though her variety store has not been sustained, its small profit somehow provided her family with the necessities. Joan is just sad because she has allowed a lot of people to purchase items she sells on credit, expecting that she could be paid back. Instead of regret, Joan feels happy to have had that experience, because from it she learned about managing and dealing with costumers. She also learned that her 24-year-old husband who is a driver will still support her, even in her disappointments. Now, Joan and her husband have decided to use this loan she is requesting to start up a hog fattening business.\r\n\r\nHog fattening is a kind of business wherein, after four months of raising or fattening hogs, the hog will be sold to people in their village or in the market, either alive or slaughtered. The larger the volume of hogs being sold, the larger the profit. Therefore, Joan can put up a savings fund for her four children whose age range is from one to seven years old. Through this she hopes to support their education until they graduate from college, and hopefully they will have a better life in the

She now earns an average monthly income of PHP15,000. \r\n\r\nMayflor is  borrowing PHP 14,000 so that she can purchase more stocks to sell. This will be her seventh loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 12,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. \r\n\r\nMayflor aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well being by following the  Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means \"honorable\"). NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams.

Walaupun pekarangan tidak begitu luas, Saman tetap bahagia terutama semangat dalam membantu suami mencari nafkah. Terbukti 2 bibit babi yang dipelihara sangat gemuk karena Saman sangat rajin memberi makan dan menjaga kesehatan babinya. Selain memberi makan dedak padi dan dedak gandum, juga diberi makanan tambahan seperi batang pisang dan juga dedaunan. Saman senang bila tiba saatnya pelanggan babi datang untuk membeli babinya. Karena  keuntungan yang diterima sangat membantu kebutuhan rumah tangganya. Dalam 6 bulan bisa meraup keuntungan Rp.1.000.000,- bersih. Keuntungan ini akan digunakan untuk membantu suaminya dalam memenuhi kebutuhan hidup setiap hari dan juga ditabung. Saat ini Saman membutuhkan tambahan modal didalam usahanya untuk membeli  bibit yang baru yang lebih banyak agar usaha ini bisa maju dan

She used this money to invest in buying duck eggs, selling them at the local market and in bulk to restaurants.  The profit made daily was just enough to cover her family expenses.  The following years, she has been obtaining larger loans to increase the volume of her business.  In 2000, she was able to use the money she made to purchase a piece of land to build ducks houses for nesting and laying eggs.  Her inventory was enough to sell to the local market, eateries and restaurants.  After 10 plus years of borrowing along with smart investment, she has seen a success and growth with her business.  Presently, she has 2 egg warmers that produces 40.000 duck eggs a week, which she use to cater to eateries, restaurants and to the locals in her village.  This next loan, she is requesting 19.000.000 in which she plans to use for her business.

Her husband also works with them on their farm, cultivating potatoes; they have farmed for many years and it has gone very well for the family.  Every now and then, she also makes cheese and takes it to sell in the market.  A year ago, customers started to ask her for woolen yarn since she has plenty of wool from the animals on her farm.  Now she makes the yard while she takes their livestock out to pasture; she sells it for ~$4\/kilo depending on the thickness of the yarn.  She sells it to the artisans of San Pedro D. Cajas who make it into blankets and tapistries.  \r\n\r\nShe gets up at 5 am to make breakfast and lunch for her family; her husband takes his food to the farm.  Since she was young, she has spun yarn and she likes what she does.  It is a profitable business and she is happy doing it.  This is the fourth loan she has requested from MFP and she has been punctual in her payments.  The money will be used to purchase a yarn spinning machine so she can produce more.  The rest will be invested in fertilizer for their farmland.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Scott Crandall, Kiva

Since she was 20 she has been studying all areas related to electrical installations, because she has family members who work in that area.  To join the family business she learned how to install alarms, and started doing that work three years ago.  She enjoys the work because it is not very complicated and most businesses want alarm installations for their protection, so it is a profitable business.

While it is not the only means by which revenue is generated, the business' main source of income is from the planting and harvesting of bananas for sale. Celerina has been engaged in her business for over 10 years and earns approximately 2,000 PHP a month from it.\r\n\r\nIn 2008 Celerina joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services in order to help improve her living conditions and ability to engage in business activities. Celerina has successfully repaid a previous loan of 7,000 PHP from GDMPC. This earlier loan was used to purchase additional seeds, seedlings and young crops to raise. Celerina is now requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP that will be used to purchase fertilizers, such as manure. This loan will be the fifth loan taken out by Celerina from GDMPC.

He lives with his family. He has owned a perfume and pocketbook shop in his town since 2003. His shop is well known because he always tries to offer the new brands to his local customers.  In almost all parts of Lebanon, demand for beauty and fashion products continues to be high.  His brother is out of Lebanon so he is the one who is helping his father with the household expenses.

She is the wife of her husband Wilfredo, and mother to their children. She and her husband manage their own household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nJosie operates a foam\/pillow manufacturing business. Her products are foam for beds and pillows. They assemble foam and pillows out of materials she buys from the factory. They prepare the bed and pillowcases and assemble them with the foam materials. She sells her products directly to the market and the local community. She earns a minimum of 5000 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every week.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue the operation of her business, she is requesting a 16,000 PHP loan. She will use the loan to buy more quantities of raw materials. She expects a boost in income as she expands her business.\r\n\r\nJosie hopes to grow her business in the coming years and dreams to be able to give her children a good and high-quality education through all her hard work on her business.

He is single, has no children, and lives alone in his own house, but he still undertakes to contribute to his parents' household expenses. He always keeps an eye on his parents so that he can offer them anything they need.\r\n\r\nJuan's work consists of selling drinks, which he buys in bulk, and oftn sells alongside related products such as ice-cream and sorbets. He has been doing this work for a year. When he began, he found he had a lot of competition, but as time has gone on people began to prefer his products, because the products are always well chilled and served with a smile. He works alone, which is esential to maintaining his income. What he likes about his work is that it gives him time to do other things: he also works in a bank in the city, which gives him greater financial stability.

He has owned his lands for about 4 years, deciding to move away from his family's plot shortly after having his first child. Although his farm is small, it provides enough rice to support the household. He learned rice farming from his father, who has been farming for his entire life as well. He and his wife Andrea have two children, one who is 5 and the other who is 2. They are optimistic about the loan and are hoping their lands continue to be productive.  <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p> <\/p>\r\n<h4>The Paypayales Communal Bank in Santa Lucia<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Roberto is part of one of the newest Communal Banks in the recently developed Mifex Rural Finance Program: the Paypayales Communal Bank. All bank members are part of a rice farmers' cooperative in Santa Lucia named Dios Con Nosotros (God is with us). They will use these microloans to prepare their lands and cultivate rice on their farms. As members of a communal bank, they are all the guarantors for each other's loans. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the Dios con Nosotros Cooperative are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many microfinance programs, but Mifex believes that is imperative for the communities we works with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Below is more information about the commnity of Santa Lucia, compiled by Luis Crespo and Robert Edgar of the Mifex team when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. Special thanks to Mario Balazantegui who provided expert insight and contributed to the development of the alliances with the local organizations. <\/em><\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Economy of Santa Lucia<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Santa Lucia County has a population of about 33,000 people. The region is fit for rice cultivating because it is not in the lowlands and therefore it is not at risk of flooding. There is also great access to water because of the Daule River, which is accessible to many of the farmers in the area. About 70% of the farmers have basic infrastructure for watering their crops. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rice production is the main economic activity of the area, as about 80% of the people are rice farmers. Almost everyone is either directly or indirectly involved with the rice production, as they produce, commercialize or participate in activities that add value to the product. Within the county, there is a small town also named Santa Lucia. The town is filled with many small businesses and it serves as the social and commercial hub of the area.  <\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Rice Farming in Santa Lucia<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Most of the people in the Santa Lucia area are small farmers. They produce about 100 sacks of rice per hectare of land. In order to farm they first must prepare the lands by removing weeds and plowing. The farmers then fill an area with water to form what is known as a paddy field, because rice is a very water intensive crop. The rice seeds are either dispersed freely (the process is known as <i>boleo<\/i> in Spanish) or hand sowed. Once the rice has grown, most farmers rent machinery that helps them harvest their crop. A risk factor does exist in rice farming because of drought, but in Santa Lucia this is somewhat mitigated by the access to water form the nearby river.  <\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Access to Credit<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The biggest struggle in the area has been the lack of credit. Because people do not have access to formal financial services, they have turned to loan sharks for financing. They have been affected by expensive lines of credit that exceed 100% interest a year and can be as expensive as 240%. Intermediaries also exploit the farmers because of their outstanding debt. Farmers also often lack skills and knowledge of how to commercialize their product and get fair prices for their crops.  <\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Loan Use<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The loans in this sector will be used to to buy soil, seeds, fertilizer and insecticides. They will also be used to prepare the land prior to farming, to plant the seeds and purchase other materials. The loan repayment schedule is different from the typical microentrepreneur. Because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures, Mifex asks them to repay 50% of the capital in the first 6 months of the loan.

She travels to different towns and villages to sell new clothes. She is married and the mother of five children. Digna is assisted by her husband, a farmer and cattle rancher.

They have 2 children, who are both living at home. Nuria and her husband are farmers. They cultivate citrus fruit on their family's plots and they harvest the fruit between January and March. Because their farming does not bring in any money the rest of the year, Nuria's husband also works as a builder and she dedicates herself to a variety of activities. For example, she sells clothes with her sister every other weekend (see photo). Once, while she and her sister were selling clothes, they met people who farmed silk and who had been raising their own silkworms for a year. Listening to these people carefully, Nuria realized that the idea of becoming a silk farmer really appealed to her. She also thinks it will be quite profitable and would love to become a successful businesswoman in this trade. It would be wonderful to have another steady income, and not to have to wait so anxiously for the citrus harvest each year. Nuria also hopes to become a very active member of her communal bank and thus grow as a person. This is her first loan from MFP, and she is committed to making her repayments punctually.

They live in the village of Bulubitoon, Brgy. Miranda, Hinigaran, in Negros Occidental with their three children, who range in age from six to twelve years-old. Jeremy's mission in life is to help her husband raise their three children well, and provide them with a good future through education. In the short term, she plans to earn enough income to defray their small family's household expenses.\r\n<p>\r\nHer aspirations for her family became more attainable when she joined NWTF-Project Dungganon to access the microcredit loans it offers using the Grameen methodology. She used the first loan as capital to set up her own general store. She was very happy when she saw that even with just a small amount of capital and its small returns, she was able to help provide for her family and set aside some savings for future security. She was able to increase her next loan amount by paying back each weekly installment on time, and paying off the loan within the set term. As a result, she was able to expand her business and started a food vending business. She knows that she is well on her way to attaining her dreams, as each new loan has also increased her monthly income. At present, she earns an average income of PHP 8,000 per month from her business activities.\r\n<p>\r\nIn her previous ninth loan cycle, she borrowed PHP 16,000, which she used as additional capital in her business. She maintained her good track record by paying each installment on time, and paying back the full amount within the set loan term. Jeremy plans to borrow PHP 17,000 for her tenth loan cycle to buy stocks for her business, such as the very in-demand firecrackers and fireworks, in preparation for the coming holiday season.\r\n<p>\r\nJeremy is shown in the attached picture with her 2 sons.\r\n<p>\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the calling of not just of a few but thousands of women. Through the alleviation program, these women have progressed from earning less than a measly $1 a day, to surpassing the realities beyond their dreams. They have learned to live a life where they can finally be called honorable. This is Project Dungganon. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":395990,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

She operates a business which is the buying and selling of junk items. Her average gross sales is about 2,000 pesos per day which can really help with their daily expenditures.\n\nEufracia sells her junk items daily. She is requesting a loan of 5,750 pesos so she can buy more junk items which she will then sell again. She is quite happy in her business and has it expand as people become more aware of recycling. \n  \nEufracia is already on her 8th loan and her previous loan was 5,500 pesos.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\nIMON's History\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

For this reason, Mahmadsaid is requesting your help with a loan of $1000 to increase his production with the purchase of additional seeds and fertilizer.   \r\n \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is a cheerful and responsible woman and a single mother of 2 beautiful children:  Jeyson,  8 and Jeniffer,   3 months old. They live in their own house located in the Peruvian jungle (a native community called Centro Pumpuriani). For 2 years she has planted different products, such as plantains, yucca, and hybrid corn. This brings her earnings at different times of the year. For example, she harvests the corn 6 months after planting, the yucca after the corn, and the plantains every two weeks. This helps her invest more. When her crops are ready, she sells them to buyers who come on weekends to the native community. What Lida likes the most is being able to plant different varieties of products, in addition to spending her free time planting and clearing on other land, where they pay her extra money according to how long she works there. Now she plans to plant citrus, since these crops are grown for 8 years before they begin producing- enough time to be able to generate more income in the future. Meanwhile, she is taking advantage of the coffee harvest these months, when she for sure will be able to make some income. She belongs to the \u201cAbejitas de Pumpuriani\u201d [Little Bees of Pumpuriani] community bank, and this is her third loan with MFP. She hopes to have their cooperation to achieve her goals. She is also committed once again to making her payments, as with the previous loans she had. In addition, she likes being a part of her community bank because all of its members are responsible and supportive people.

2003, Tatyana has had a small business selling women\u2019s lingerie. She is divorced and has one son. The business is the main source of income for her and her son. Tatyana acknowledges that through her experience she has learned a tremendous amount about every aspect of business. \r\n\r\nHer resolution and determination in her work have helped her learn flexibility and develop qualities like patience, perseverance and customer-friendliness. Tatyana\u2019s ability to learn her customer\u2019s preferences and tastes has helped her be more effective in her trade and achieve sales success.   \r\n\r\nTatyana is requesting a loan of $1,000 to purchase a vending facility and begin construction of a kiosk. She is also planning to use some money to re-stock her inventory so she can increase her sales. We believe that her hard work and common sense in combination with financial assistance will help Tatyana achieve her goals and expand her business as a result.
