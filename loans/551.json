Recently she has been bedridden due to health problems. Despite this, she is a very courageous woman, continuing to work to be able to provide her daughter with the necessities. \r\n\r\nThe work that this lovely woman makes a living at is the purchase and sale of vegetables. She sells them at the wholesale market in her city on Wednesdays, Fridays and Sundays in a stall she rented in the vegetable section. On market days everyone in town buys food for the week. Lidia moves between 3,000 and 4,000 nuevos soles worth, generating a 10% profit on the best days. However, as a good manager of her profits, she invests all of her savings in the purchase of a truck to transport her harvest to the city. Additionally, she earns money by planting potatoes and peas. She tends to and fertilizes her crops on weekends. \r\n\r\nHer work is going well. Selling her product at retail herself, without middlemen, generates more profits on her crops. She belongs to the \u201cIntegra\u201d community bank and this is her seventh loan with MFP where she awaits financial support to realize her objectives. She is committed to making her payments with punctuality. Upon receiving this support, Lidia will use the money requested to buy several sacks of vegetables, legumes and greens to supply her business.

is 36 years old and lives with his wife and their three children. He has been familiar with agriculture since he was young. Thanks to his parents he knows how to work the land. Now he supports himself entirely from potato production. He works all day cleaning, irrigating and fertilizing his fields so that his production will be good. He has always liked cleaning his fields because it is important and is lighter work than many of his tasks.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

All the preceding loans have been correctly repaid.  \r\n<p>\r\nThe women plan to use this loan to buy sacks of rice, sugar, and various condiments.  Supplies of fruit are gotten from orchards, and the condiments are gotten from the marketplace.  Sales are made retail through their eateries, where customers pay cash and buy fruit and juices.  \r\n<p>\r\nThe group members each hope to realize an average profit of 110,000 francs CFA in the course of this cycle.  The profits will be used to pay the loan interest, to provide for the extended family, and to invest the rest in business.

Wenefrida has been involved in her business for over 9 years and earns approximately 7,000 PHP a month from it.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Wenefrida joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Wenefrida has successfully repaid a previous loan of 8,000 PHP from HSPFI, which was used to purchase additional materials needed in her food stall, such as food containers and plates. Wenefrida is requesting a new loan of 11,000 PHP, which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This will be the 3rd loan taken out by Wenefrida from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement her family's income. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Alice is requesting a new loan of 15,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional inventory and provide working capital. This will be the third loan that Alice has taken out from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve her family's general living conditions. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in north-western Mindanao.

She earns her living by operating fish vending and fishing businesses. Her husband Jory, who is 49 years old, works as a fisherman to earn his living and helps in his wife's business activities.  They have nine children who are between 1 and 28 years old. Remy joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2004 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 13 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Remy has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 29,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 27,000, uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 14th loan, she is borrowing PHP 28,000 to buy a new fishing boat so that she can continue to save up for the future education of her children. Remy is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She is married to Lordjim, an overseas contract worker, and a mother of three children. She and her husband manage the household while operating the business. At this time, Julieta is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nJulieta operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries, and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, 5 Philippine pesos (PHP) worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns income by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 250 PHP in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operating her business, Julieta is requesting a 10,000 PHP loan. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nJulieta hopes to be able to expand soon and dreams of giving her children a good and high quality education through all her hard work on her business.

years ago, Salome started farming on a small inherited piece of land in Kianjai, a remote village in the Eldoret area of Kenya.

She is a passionate farmer and, because of the immense knowledge she has of farming, she commands a lot of respect from other farmers in her village. \r\n\r\nDairy farming is close to her heart; every day she wakes up to milk her cow and that makes her very proud. Although she makes profits through milk selling, she lacks a proper dairy unit and she is seeking a loan to build a modern dairy unit. Through the loan she will have a better time milking her cow and also feeding. \r\n\r\nA modern dairy unit provides a good place where cows can relax and also prevents them from diseases that may arise because of being exposed to harsh weather conditions such as rain. Salome believes that through this loan her living conditions will change because she is going to have an increase in milk production. She will save money that she used to spend on treating her cows because she lacked a good dairy unit.

In the beginning she only has several chickens in the farm.  Those chickens were allowed to roam around and seek their own food.  Feeding is only done once a day, in the morning.  She couldn't make enough money by just selling eggs.  After joining DINARI Foundation, Komang S. obtained funding and training assistance on proper chicken farming techniques.  Ni Komang is trying to apply her learning.\r\nThe loan she obtains will be used to repair and expand the pen, so she can farm more chicken and feed more.  At this time she has 50 egg producing hens and 5 roosters.  She spends about $1.70 for feeds that consists of rice, corn and concentrate.  She earns $4.44 a day by selling eggs.  She may earn net profit of 2.75 per day.  From this profit, Ni Komang S. can supplement income from her husband, Gusti Ketut Sumantri, and pay her 2 children's tuition.

Semula hanya memelihara beberapa ekor saja. Ayam-ayam tersebut dibiarkan hidup bebas untuk mencari makan sendiri. Pemberian pakan hanya diberikan waktu pagi hari saja. Hasil telurnya pun masih belum maksimal. Dengan bergabung dengan Yayasan DINARI Ni Komang S. mendapat bantuan dana dan pembinaan budidaya ternak ayam secara baik. Ni Komang S. mencoba menerapkan apa yang sudah didapatkan dalam pembinaan dari Yayasan DINARI. \r\nDengan dana  tersebut kandang mulai diperbaiki dan diperbesar lagi, jumlah ayam diperbanyak , pemberian pakan pun dilakukan secara teratur. Saat ini jumlah ayam petelur sudah mencapai 50 ekor dan ayam pejantan 5 ekor. Biaya pakan dalam sehari mencapai Rp.15.000,-.  Pakan ayam terdiri dedak padi, jagung dan konsetrat.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \n\nIMON's History\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The couple engage in fishpond fishing as their source of income. \r\n<p>\r\nShe was one of the active members of Paglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative under the micro-finance program called PDP-LP at their Barangay. She was recognized by the co-op in July 2005 and has availed herself six times of the credit service offered by the program. Now she has applied for an amount of Php 14,900.00, to be used to pay for labor in repairing and cultivating an extension of the fishpond. \r\n<p>\r\nBefore Loreta became a member of Paglaum, her family suffered financially. Their only source of living comes from fishing, and earnings are unpredictable because they use only a fishing net. After having accessed the credit services as a Paglaum member, Loreta reports significant financial improvements in her family\u2019s well-being. She is grateful for the help she has received from Paglaum because it has contributed so much to her family.\r\n<p>\r\nThe couple is hoping that they will always experience a good and abundant harvest and that all of their children can eventually finish a college course.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":300980,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Repair

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It is located in the community of Jaloxtoc, in the city of Ayala, which is in the state of Morelos, Mexico. It consists of four members, who are women and are neighbors. \r\n\r\nThe members of the group are: Dolores B. V., who is going to use her loan to buy men's and women's perfumes to fill the orders she has received from catalog sales; Se\u00f1ora Mar\u00eda Guadalupe F.

M. is going to buy soft drinks and vegetables to increase her business, which is selling Mexican snacks and clothing through door-to-door sales. \r\n\r\nSe\u00f1ora Graciela is 35 years old. She studied in the open junior high school for one year and obtained her certificate. She is married and has 3 children: Ren\u00e9 Josu\u00e9 is 14 and is in secondary school; Andr\u00e9s is 13 and is in secondary school; and Anai is 11 and is in primary school. Se\u00f1ora Graciela has two businesses; she sells clothing door-to-door and she sells snacks such as tostadas, prepared chicharrones, and tamales. She is applying for the loan to increase her business. She is going to buy soft drinks and vegetables to prepare the snacks that she sells. In her clothing business, she offers her customers shoes and clothing such as pants, blouses, handkerchiefs and skirts. She began her business a year ago. She was instructed by Se\u00f1ora Guadalupe, who is also a member of the group and invited her to join. Se\u00f1ora Graciela liked it and decided to sell clothing door-to-door. Her husband lent her the money to buy the clothing, and she remembers that when she began to sell she was very happy. Her business is important because it has helped her earn money and they are better off, and it is a help when they need to buy something. Her favorite part of her business is when she goes out to offer clothing to her customers because it is relaxing and she meets more people. She calls on 20 to 25 customers a day. In addition, she feels proud when she makes sales and has money. She uses the earnings from her business to improve her house and to buy more clothing to sell. She wants to buy a three-wheeled vehicle to use in transporting her merchandise, and she thinks she can do it with loans. Her children help her in her business. When she sells tostadas, they help her carry her things to the corner, because not many people pass by her house. The improvements that she wants to do on her house are to finish the bathroom and tile it. Her plans and hopes are that her family will live better and that her business increases. Se\u00f1ora Graciela is very happy with the loan that she will receive because it is going to increase her business. Her goals for her children are that they excel and that they study for careers so that they live better. This loan will help her because she knows how to make good use of it.\r\n\r\nThe members of the group want to say to Kiva and Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad (Reality Foundation) \"many thanks for having confidence in us and lending us the money to excel in our businesses.\" Jaloxtoc is a pretty, peaceful, united, and community-minded town.

The distribution of farming inputs is part of One Acre Fund\u2019s integrated agriculture package, which includes training, reliable input supply (such as fertilizer and seeds), credit and insurance.\r\n\r\nWith income from his maize sales, Alex will educate his children, build a house and invest in livestock rearing.\r\n\r\nIn 2012, the members of Mungano Youth group will each plant maize plots between \u00bd and 1 acre of land.\r\n\r\nIn the photograph above, Alex is pictured with his group members.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":920983,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To source farming inputs, such as seeds and fertilizer, at low prices for the 2012 planting season","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Chwele","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2011-11-23T00:30:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":775,"lender_count":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alex","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ann","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Joseph","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kaitano","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mary","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Judith","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Everlyne","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-11-20T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":71050,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71050}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":775}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":775,"local_amount":71050,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-27T10:16:30Z","rounded_local_amount":71532.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315680887}],"funded_date":"2011-12-16T22:35:22Z","paid_date":"2012-11-27T10:16:30Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":364260,"name":"Chanthou","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Chanthou (in the photo) and her husband, Sophea, 20, live along National Road Number One, about fifteen kilometers from Phnom Penh, the capital city of Cambodia.

In their loan application, the group described their business as follows:\r\n<p>\r\n\u201cBackground:  The project is located in the village of Oussouye located at 40 km from the regional capital, Ziguinchor.  Oussouye is a touristic village and commerce is the main livelihood of its inhabitants.  The women engage in commerce by exporting local products such as dried fish, palm oil, and wild fruits such as made and tole to the cities.\r\n<p>\r\nPurpose:  The Tessito 2 group has the purpose of improving the living conditions of our members and alleviating the housewife's burden.\r\n<p>\r\nBusiness activities:  The principal business of the group is trading, which consists of purchasing and reselling seafood, fruits, and palm oil from the region of Ziguinchor.  In order to succeed in this business, the Tessito 1 group sollicits a loan of 600,000 francs (about $1200) in order to undertake these activities.\u201d \r\n<p>\r\nBackground\r\n<p>\r\nSenegal is one of the world\u2019s poorest countries, yet its solid democratic tradition and highly developed associational life distinguish it from other countries in its income group. Especially remarkable are Senegal\u2019s networks of rotating savings and credit associations, known as tontines. Commonly organized by groups of twenty to thirty housewives who live in the same village, the tontines provide poor women throughout the country with small loans to finance modest income-generating activities. Repayment rates within these associations are excellent, because they are based on local reputation and personal trust between the members. However, their financial resources are limited to the contributions of their members, frequently subsistence farmers with very little disposable income. This has prevented the traditional tontines from meeting the demand for rural microenterprise loans and restricted their impact on the economic development of their communities. The SEM Fund works to bridge this gap by linking traditional village credit associations with outside sources of finance.\r\n<p>\r\nOriginal French business description:\r\n<p>\r\n\u00abContexte : : Le projet se situe dans l\u2019\u00e9co village de Oussouye situ\u00e9 \u00e0 40 km de la capitale r\u00e9gionale ( Ziguinchor)\r\nOussouye est un 2co villave touristique et le commerce est la principale activit\u00e9 des populations\r\nLes femmes se donnent surtout au commerce en exportant vers les grandes villes des produits locaux  tel que le poisson sec, l\u2019huile de palme, des fruits sauvages comme le made, le tole etc.\r\n<p>\r\nObjectif : : Le groupement T\u00e9ssito 2 s\u2019est fix\u00e9 entre autre objectif : \r\nD\u2019am\u00e9liorer les conditions de vie de ses membres ;\r\nD\u2019all\u00e9g\u00e9 le panier de la m\u00e9nag\u00e8re ;\r\n<p>\r\nActivit\u00e9s : la principale activit\u00e9 du groupement est : le commerce ;

K. is 47 years old. He is married and has 2 children. He has a high school education. He works as a supervisor in the local farm called \"Dyust\". \"Dyust\" maintans an area of 23.10 hectares. He supervises a group of 15 people (which includes his family members). On the farm, the workers plant cotton, wheat, corn, and onions. He has been a client of MicroInvest since 2006. The first credit was in the amount of 2,000 som ($575). Using that credit, Fotil planted onions on 2 hectares of land. He was able to get a profit of 5,000 som ($1450). Using that money he fixed his house. This time, he is asking for 3,000 som ($875), so he could plant onions and wheat on 1 hetare of land each.\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Russian by Vasilisa Budnikova, Kiva

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

This has enabled her to make improvements to her house.  But, she still does not have a floor, the walls are not plastered, and the bad roof needs to be changed because it leaks in the winter.  She previously had a latrine, but she bought a toilet.  She put it in the bathroom, but there still are no walls or flooring in the bathroom.  When it rains, it gets wet.  It has inadequate sanitary conditions.  It is only covered with zinc, which is very unsafe for personal hygiene.  Also, she is afraid that someone will steal the toilet because there is delinquency in her neighborhood.\r\n\r\nShe is 48.

M. is 56 years old and lives in the Medardo Andino neighborhood. He is married, and his wife is a cashier. They have one child at home; previously, they had two more in their care, but those children grew up and became independent, so the couple are now taking care of only the youngest. Currently, the boy is studying, but he is also working to contribute to the household expenses. The family's central plan is to make improvements to their home, in order to raise their quality of life. Jose has earned a living as a mason for 20 years. Among the main difficulties he has faced are the asthma attacks he suffers, which affect him most strongly when he is at home. This is due to the impoverished conditions he lives in, which increase his risk of having more frequent asthma attacks.

She is known for the tenderness with which she treats all the children under her care and they are all used to her way of being.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, Genoveva sells children\u2019s clothing to these children\u2019s parents; to insure that they keep the goods, she sells on credit.  This is a way for her to earn extra income for her home; besides, she usually sells out all her merchandise.\r\n\r\nShe is happy to care for children and sell clothing at the same time, a way to double her household\u2019s income.  This is why her husband, Victor, who transports passengers with his three-wheeled vehicle in the market, wants to support her with her purchases so that she won\u2019t lack merchandise to sell.\r\n\r\nIn the future, she would like to increase the variety of exclusive items, her greatest wish being to have a fixed site in the market so that she can work together with her husband.\r\n\r\nThis is her 3rd loan with MFP and she reconfirms her intention to repay in a timely fashion; she also mentions that she likes her fellow group members very much.\r\n\r\nShe will use

He lives with his two wives and his children in Hamdallaye, one of the more sought after neighbourhoods of the city of Sikasso (in the Third Administrative District of the Republic of Mali).\r\n\r\nHe wasn't fortunate enough to go to school, but he quickly learned how to market fertilizers, pesticides and insecticides and has been in this business for more than twenty years.  Because of his extensive experience in this business, he has a good reputation and many orders, but doesn't have the resources necessary to satisfy the demand.  Therefore he is seeking a third loan from Soro Yiriwaso, which will allow him to buy 9 bags of urea, 8 bags of cotton fertilizer blend and 8 bags of ma\u00efze fertilizer blend as well as some sprayers, so that he can satisfy the needs of his ever growing client base.  Both previous loans were reimbursed on time.  \r\n\r\nHe buys his supplies from the representative of the Toguina fertilizer factory in Sikasso, who has a store in the new Medina market in Sikasso.  His clients are farmers and some pay by cash while others have lines of credit.  \r\n\r\nWith this loan, Mr. B. expects to make 150,000 CFA francs per month.  This income will allow him to cover his and his family's living expenses, pay interest on the loan, and invest the rest in his business.  \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Eileen Jessop, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":572209,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farm Supplies","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"To buy fertilizers, pesticides, insecticides and sprayers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sikasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.316667 -5.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":800,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Bakary ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-07-02T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":400000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2010-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2010-11-29T08:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2010-12-29T08:00:00Z","amount":66666.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":133.33},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":133.34},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":133.33},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":133.33},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":133.34},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":133.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Eileen Jessop","image":249690}},{"id":220815,"name":"Jesusa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jesusa P., from the village of Allinguigan 3rd, is 45 years old, married and has three school-aged children.

Nino plans to sell 75% of the harvested Lucerne on the market and, taking into account the current market price, she will earn GEL 1300. The reminding 25% of the Lucerne will be used for feeding her own cows. The income will be used for improvement of the family\u2019s living conditions.

College is a dream for most poor Filipino parents like Zenaida, as she herself has been an elementary graduate. She believes that a college diploma is the best inheritance parents could leave to their children.\r\n\r\nZenaida operates a food stall. In the Philippines, the whole working community and most of the families only eat home-cooked meals during evenings where all of the family members are at home to take part of the meal. This is not only a usual family tradition but a matter of convenience and frugal living. It is considered a waste of money and time to spend cooking gas and food for one to two persons when buying cooked rice and meats cost less than raw food. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP200 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue the operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP40, 000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy more quantities of products like meats, rice, vegetables, condiments and seasonings. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n \r\nZenaida dreams to be able to give her child a good and high quality education, through all her hard work on her business. She also prays for good health always and to be able to establish more food stalls someday. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week. This is where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay Micro Finance

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

She is the group leader of a two-member group loan offered by GDMPC. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is Tundan 2.\r\n\r\nYolanda is 41 and married with six school-aged children. She has a store selling daily use products such as shampoo, candies, sugar, salt, soap and toothpaste. Yolanda has been engaged in her business for over a year and earns approximately 5000 PHP a month. \r\n\r\nIn 2009, Yolanda joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Yolanda has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5000 PHP from GDMPC. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional inventory & working capital. Yolanda is requesting a new loan of 6000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the second loan taken out by Yolanda from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement the family's income. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC: GDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three units offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

He is 41 years old, married, and has four children, ages 10, 8, 7 and 2.  The three oldest children go to school.  Alexandre only finished first grade; he did not continue with school because his parents felt it was more important for him to take care of the family's cattle.  He lives in his own house with his family and does not support anyone else.\r\n\r\n20 years ago, Alexandre left Chibuto to move to Boane District with his family because of the civil war.  He has been a businessman for more than four years and also works as a guard for Aguas de Mo\u00e7ambique.  His wife also has a job and has helped Alexandre.  He has no employees and has an income of about 7,000 meticais per month.  He uses this money for household expenses and saves some of it through Xitique (a traditional system of rotating savings).\r\n\r\nAlexandre has never taken out loans from other banks.  He learned about Hluvuku through neighbors who are also customers of this institution.  This 10,200 meticais loan is his first.  He intends to buy products (rice, sugar, oil, salt and other items) to increase his inventory.\r\n\r\nHe promises to pay off this loan on time to maintain his good credit.  In the future, Alexandre would like to apply for loans to build another shop.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Danielle Maxson, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":547093,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Purchase of products (rice, oil, sugar, salt, etc.)","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MZ","country":"Mozambique","town":"Boane, Maputo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-26.041667 32.325278","type":"point"}},"partner_id":23,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alexandre Samuel ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-04-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MZN","disbursal_amount":10200,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-27T07:00:00Z","amount":379.09},{"due_date":"2010-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":396.23},{"due_date":"2010-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":414.14},{"due_date":"2010-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":432.86},{"due_date":"2010-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":452.43},{"due_date":"2010-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":472.88},{"due_date":"2010-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":494.26},{"due_date":"2010-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":516.6},{"due_date":"2011-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":539.96},{"due_date":"2011-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":564.37},{"due_date":"2011-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":589.88},{"due_date":"2011-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":616.54},{"due_date":"2011-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":644.42},{"due_date":"2011-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":673.55},{"due_date":"2011-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":704},{"due_date":"2011-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":735.82},{"due_date":"2011-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":769.08},{"due_date":"2011-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":803.89}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":12.08},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":12.62},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.2},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.79},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.42},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15.06},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15.75},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.46},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17.21},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.98},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.8},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.64},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.53},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.46},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.44},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.44},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.51},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25.61}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":208541,"name":"Gloria","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Gloria, de 42 a\u00f1os, vive en su casa que es propia, al lado de su pareja y sus 2 peque\u00f1os hijos.Se dedica a la venta de bebidas, desde hace varios a\u00f1os, y  le resulta bastante rentable gracias a la dedicaci\u00f3n diaria.

Luzviminda aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and to ensure their future well-being by following the  Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest

She lives with her husband and their six children in the Pelengana S\u00e9b\u00e9nikoro district of S\u00e9gou (the third administrative region of Mali). She did not have an opportunity to go to school as her parents, who saw school as the road to perdition for girls, had refused to allow it. Therefore she started working and earning an income early on. She tried different types of activities, such as selling beignets, shoes, millet and grilled peanuts. Finally, she settled on this last line of business (selling millet and grilled peanuts), which she has been engaged in for about 12 years, at the  Ch\u00e2teau de Segou market as well as other local markets (the Monday market in S\u00e9gou and the Thursday market of Banankoro).\r\n\r\nIn order to grill peanuts , she puts them in a large heavy skillet over fire. From time to time she stirs peanuts with a ladle; this repetitive process can take a while\r\n\r\nWith the goal of strengthening her business, she turned to Soro Yiriwaso. She has been a member for 56 months. After four solidarity loans and four individual loans, all duly repaid, she is now on her fifth individual loan, which she plans to use for purchasing 18 bags of peanuts and 12 bags of millet.

District. The leaders in this group represent a total of 40 individual farmers (not pictured) who are each asking for an average loan of 5,349 shillings (KES) to purchase a One Acre Fund package for \u00bc acre of maize and \u00bc acre of sorghum or millet. As the Kiva group representative, David is pictured on the right of the Mkilima Group with his hand raised. \r\n\r\nDavid is 47 years old, and a reliable member of the community. He is married with eight children. David has been working as a farmer for the last seven years to support his family. In addition to this, David is very active in his community and is involved in the men's group, prayer group and burial committee. Last year he was not with One Acre Fund. He hopes as a One Acre Fund farmer he will be able to join the ranks of One Acre Fund farmers that have doubled their harvest in their first year of the program!\r\n\r\nThe 2013 Long Rains season will be David\u2019s first season with One Acre Fund. He joined this year in order to get new farming methods, get the best seed prices, get fertilizer and hybrid seeds and earn enough to feed his family and send his children to school. As an active member in his community, David also volunteered his time to be a group leader and Kiva representative because he likes being a leader. He wants to help more farmers and spread the story about One Acre Fund farmers. David plans on using future profits from the harvest to send his children to school, repair the home, save for the future, and buy a cow. He believes that his life will improve by working with One Acre Fund because he has more farm training, has more farm group support, and will be able to feed his family. One Acre Fund focuses on working with smallholder farmers across Kenya.\r\n\r\n The organization pre-purchases seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings onto the farmers. David and the Mkilima Group will use the Kiva loan to cover this initial cost of purchasing the seeds and fertilizer package from One Acre Fund. One Acre Fund continue providing training and support throughout the planting and harvesting season to ensure a good harvest and repayment. With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits and improved lives. \r\nThe field officer is also included in the photo and is standing on the left of the photo."}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1486967,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to purchase cost efficient maize, millet, and sorghum seeds.

Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions.

She learned this business from her grandmother. With 8 years of experience, she enjoys the benefits of a good reputation and unequalled expertise in her area.  This brought her to establish an association to promote and defend the interests of local soap makers.\r\nWith the intent of growing her business, Mrs. Salamata Traor\u00e9 (president and founding member of the association of local soap makers of the city of Bougouni) decided to integrate the loan program from the microfinance institution Soro Yiriwaso, from whom she has requested her first loan. With this loan she plans to purchase 15 bags of caustic soda, 7 kilograms of shea butter, 20 liters of peanut oil and 15 bags of powdered soap.\r\nShe stocks her basic supplies on site at Bougouni and the soap production takes place in her home workshop. The products are mixed and poured into molds to create different colored soaps. She then sells them for cash or on credit. Her clients are generally shopkeepers, retailers and travelling salespeople.  This process (the purchase of supplies, production and sales) takes one month. \r\nShe foresees earning a profit of 50,000 FCFA per month which she will use to pay the interest on the loan and to contribute to her family expenses. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Allana Carlyle, Kiva

All of their children have only completed their studies at the elementary level.  \r\n\r\nFelicitas has been managing the business for almost ten years and was somehow able to develop her store. Aside from selling basic commodities like soap, snack foods, and soft drinks, she is now selling vegetables that are displayed in front of her store. Felicitas wanted her business to expand, so she is asking for a loan amounting to PHP 6,000 that she will use as additional capital for her store. Through the program, she has been encouraged to work hard and be patient in paying her loans for the sake of her business' progress and her family's living.

Pictured here is 42 year-old Mary K. from Mwanza She is married with five children who are between the ages of 15 and 25 years old.\r\n \r\nMary has been running a grocery business since 2005. She sells a number of food items such as onions, tomatoes, chili, oil, rice, cabbages, spinach and dried fish. She works at the business for 12 hours per day, six days per week. Mary currently earns about 100 USD a month from her business. \r\n\r\nShe is currently requesting a loan of 400 USD in order to buy more fruits, cabbages, spinach, tomatoes and onions. In the future, she plans to increase her stocks. Mary thanks you for her support!\r\n\r\nABOUT SELFINA:\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":271114,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy more fruits, cabbages, spinach, tomatoes and onions","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mwanza","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.516667 32.9","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-02-15T02:20:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mary","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-02-26T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-03-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:56:24Z","rounded_local_amount":52400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130780},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-04-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:24:25Z","rounded_local_amount":52400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027569},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-05-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:13:55Z","rounded_local_amount":52400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613570},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-06-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:01:49Z","rounded_local_amount":52400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010649},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-07-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:38:32Z","rounded_local_amount":52400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63232935},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-08-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:52:31Z","rounded_local_amount":52400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73664728},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-09-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T02:45:59Z","rounded_local_amount":52400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87105452},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-10-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T06:26:46Z","rounded_local_amount":52400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97022597},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-11-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:41:43Z","rounded_local_amount":52400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103867846},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-12-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T16:44:37Z","rounded_local_amount":52400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110757047}],"funded_date":"2009-02-15T09:58:35Z","paid_date":"2010-01-15T16:44:37Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Michelle Chang","image":null}},{"id":92991,"name":"Maria Luisa","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Do\u00f1a Maria es una mujer que trabaja  en la venta de zapatos, ropa y cosm\u00e9ticos desde hace catorce a\u00f1os el cual inicio con fondos propios para apoyar a su esposo con los gastos del hogar.

He is married, 46 years old, and completed primary education. He has six children between the ages of 17 and one month old, four of whom are currently attending school. He lives in the district of Nyarugenge, Nyamirambo, near the city of Kigali. He raises chickens, and recently acquired a loan from Amasezerano in order to purchase baby chicks to increase his stock of chickens. His savings allowed him to raise the chickens and sell both chicken meat and eggs. His savings also allowed me to pay the school fees for his children. In the future, he would like to continue to repay his loan on time in order to take care of his family's needs and to stabilize his economic situation.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by

She earns her living by operating a dried fish vending business and a jewelry business.  Her common-law husband Pablito,  who is 60 years old, works as a dried dish vendor to earn his living.  Emelita has 10 children who are between 16 and 40 years old. Emelita joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2008 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past five loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Emelita has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 14,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 18,000, uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her sixth loan, she is borrowing PHP 14,000, which she intends to use as funds for her business operations to continue to save up for future expansion of her business and for family needs. Emelita is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \n\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.
