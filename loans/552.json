She is a woman who came from the department of Antioquia with her parents 20 years ago as displaced people in search of better horizons.\r\n\r\nHaving organized her household she started a business renting washing machines.  These are machines that they take to the customer\u2019s home to meet their domestic laundry needs.  Mary Luz gets help from her spouse, who is a taxi driver, and in an effort to lessen domestic chores her business generates important income for her household\u2019s wellbeing.  \r\n\r\nThe most important challenge she faces is the little working capital she has available to invest in the business.  This is the reason why she approached Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo to request her first Kiva loan that she\u2019ll use to buy two new washing machines because service requests increase daily toward other neighborhoods and she is unable to meet demand of many customers that she wants to secure to expand her market and earn higher income.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":778411,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy two new washing machines to lease out.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Cartagena de Indias","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2011-05-27T19:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mary Luz ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-05-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":650000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":98690},{"due_date":"2011-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":105149},{"due_date":"2011-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":107165},{"due_date":"2011-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":109219},{"due_date":"2011-11-06T07:00:00Z","amount":111312},{"due_date":"2011-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":118465}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.94},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.66},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.83},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.01},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":64.21},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.35}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":56.94,"local_amount":98690,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:50:36Z","rounded_local_amount":103909.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221673770},{"amount":60.66,"local_amount":105149,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-17T08:02:14Z","rounded_local_amount":110709.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227320330},{"amount":61.83,"local_amount":107165,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:07:15Z","rounded_local_amount":112832.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232803455},{"amount":63.01,"local_amount":109219,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:17:10Z","rounded_local_amount":114995,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238614532},{"amount":64.21,"local_amount":111312,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-22T08:52:36Z","rounded_local_amount":117198.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244568495},{"amount":68.35,"local_amount":118465,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:06:35Z","rounded_local_amount":124729.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250779840}],"funded_date":"2011-05-31T05:05:06Z","paid_date":"2012-01-15T10:06:35Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":306517,"name":"Marceline","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Marceline is 25 years old.

An uncle taught him this business, in the city of Lima, and with a small amount of savings he bought a small cart where he cuts keys.  He started working in Ica.

The Yakaar group describes their business plan as follows: <p>\r\n\r\n\u201cContext:  In earlier times this peanut-growing valley flourished.  Plenty of rain fell during the wet seasons and harvests were abundant.  The livestock here never knew feeding problems and lived peacefully. <p>\r\nThen rainfall became scarce, the soils became poor, and the fields no longer provided nourishment for the families.  Poverty established itself definitively. <p>\r\nFaced with this situation, the Yakaar group plans to start a sheep-raising business.  In the season before the holiday of Tabaski [a Muslim holiday known outside West Africa as Eid al-Kabir or Eid al-Adha, in which each family slaughters a sheep to commemorate the story of Abraham\u2019s sacrifice], our region of Diourbel offers excellent opportunities for fattening sheep because it is located in a grazing area and peanut-growing valley.  It is a very favorable context for fattening and marketing rams.  The requested loan will allow us to purchase a number of purebred rams in very good health.  <p>\r\n\r\nOverall objective:  To increase the income of the group members with the profit earned from sheep-raising, and to reactivate the production and sale in the local market of quality meat. <p>\r\n\r\nActivities:  Sheep-raising workshop<p>\r\nActivity 1: this will consist of purchasing thirteen rams in Djolof, which offers good prices on the rams as well as assuring their good health. <p>\r\nActivity 2: Purchasing sheep feed for proper feeding and phytosanitary maintenance, for a duration of two months in order to fatten them<p>\r\nActivity 3: Phytosanitary treatment. <p>\r\nActivity 4: A herdsman will be hired to guard and care for the sheep during the entire two-month period. <p>\r\nActivity 5: Commercialization:  After two months of fattening (with special feed) and caring for the rams, we will proceed to market them exactly on the day before Tabaski for our first cycle \u2013 just at a time when the demand is very strong and the supply of good-quality rams is often quite limited.  A quality product must be competitive on the basis of both quality and price.  <p>\r\n\r\nA total of four cycles are planned for the coming year.  Each cycle will generate a profit of 180,000 francs [about $350], so by the end of the year profits will total 720,000 francs [about $1400].  <p>\r\n\r\nStrategy:  Our strategy begins with the purchase of purebred rams; with a good diversified feeding regimen, at the end of two months the rams will be quite sleek and will be successfully during the preparations leading up to the holiday.  We will set up a methodical process for providing the market and grilled meat stands with quality meat on a quarterly basis (four cycles per year).\u201d <p>\r\n\r\nOriginal French: <p>\r\n \r\n\u201cContexte du projet :  Autrefois le bassin arachidier \u00e9tait florissant.

( quatre 04 op\u00e9rations l\u2019an) \u00bb <p>\r\n\r\nBackground : <p>\r\nSenegal is one of the world\u2019s poorest countries, yet its solid democratic tradition and highly developed associational life distinguish it from other countries in its income group. Especially remarkable are Senegal\u2019s networks of rotating savings and credit associations, which provide the rural poor throughout the country with small loans to finance modest income-generating activities. Repayment rates within these groups are excellent, because they are based on local reputation and personal trust between the members. However, their financial resources are limited to the contributions of their members, frequently subsistence farmers with very little disposable income. This has prevented the traditional associations from meeting the demand for rural microenterprise loans and restricted their impact on the economic development of their communities. Senegal Ecovillage Microfinance (SEM) works with our partner organization CRESP to bridge this gap by linking traditional village credit associations with outside sources of finance."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1175,"image":{"id":6878,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Purchase of purebred rams; feed and veterinary care; hiring of herdsman; transportation to market","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SN","country":"Senegal","town":"Ker Gu Mag","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"14 -14","type":"point"}},"partner_id":4,"posted_date":"2006-12-10T20:08:46Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1175,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ibrahima","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2006-12-30T17:27:01Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1175,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":1175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":117.5},{"due_date":"2007-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":117.5},{"due_date":"2007-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":117.5},{"due_date":"2007-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":117.5},{"due_date":"2007-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":117.5},{"due_date":"2007-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":117.5},{"due_date":"2007-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":117.5},{"due_date":"2007-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":117.5},{"due_date":"2007-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":117.5},{"due_date":"2007-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":117.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":117.5},{"due_date":"2007-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":117.5},{"due_date":"2007-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":117.5},{"due_date":"2007-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":117.5},{"due_date":"2007-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":117.5},{"due_date":"2007-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":117.5},{"due_date":"2007-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":117.5},{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":117.5},{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":117.5},{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":117.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":236,"local_amount":236,"processed_date":"2007-03-21T06:38:14Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T06:44:24Z","rounded_local_amount":236,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":10988},{"amount":107,"local_amount":107,"processed_date":"2007-03-23T04:36:16Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T06:44:24Z","rounded_local_amount":107,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":11568},{"amount":107,"local_amount":107,"processed_date":"2007-04-16T22:15:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T06:44:24Z","rounded_local_amount":107,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":13129},{"amount":107,"local_amount":107,"processed_date":"2007-05-21T21:00:34Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T06:44:24Z","rounded_local_amount":107,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":16977},{"amount":107,"local_amount":107,"processed_date":"2007-05-21T21:06:29Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T06:44:24Z","rounded_local_amount":107,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":16992},{"amount":106,"local_amount":106,"processed_date":"2007-07-22T20:35:25Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T06:44:24Z","rounded_local_amount":106,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":34410},{"amount":107,"local_amount":107,"processed_date":"2007-08-12T04:03:43Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T06:44:24Z","rounded_local_amount":107,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":41452},{"amount":107,"local_amount":107,"processed_date":"2007-09-03T17:04:54Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T06:44:24Z","rounded_local_amount":107,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":50194},{"amount":107,"local_amount":107,"processed_date":"2007-10-06T00:31:05Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T06:44:24Z","rounded_local_amount":107,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63327},{"amount":107,"local_amount":107,"processed_date":"2007-11-11T16:34:28Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T06:44:24Z","rounded_local_amount":107,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":80031},{"amount":107,"local_amount":107,"processed_date":"2007-12-08T21:35:45Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T06:44:24Z","rounded_local_amount":107,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":93771},{"amount":213,"local_amount":213,"processed_date":"2008-01-03T04:39:09Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T06:44:24Z","rounded_local_amount":213,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":106872}],"funded_date":"2006-12-16T17:27:01Z","paid_date":"2008-01-03T04:39:09Z","journal_totals":{"entries":5,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":6579,"name":"Kwesi","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Kwesi is 42 and father of 5 children, 4 of whom are in school at various levels.

She operates a restaurant serving breakfast only. She is a member of TYM fund in the village of Ph\u00fa Minh since 1994. Her initial loan was 20 USD which was used to raise pigs. In later rounds, she always qualified for maximum loans. In 2001, feeling that she has good cooking skills, she decided to take out a loan to open a restaurant right in her house. Her house location is easily accessible, right on route #2 at the intersection with the entrance to the airport. Her husband is a bus driver so he has a lot of contacts who would become her customers. The food served at the restaurant is delicious so it's no coincidence that her restaurant is busy. Her revenue is around 200 USD a month. This time she's requesting a loan of 1200 USD to buy food & drinks, to expand her restaurant to better serve her customers.\r\n\r\n<P><B>Translated from Vietnamese by Khang Ho-Si, Kiva volunteer.<P><\/b>\r\n\r\nD\u00e1ng ng\u01b0\u1eddi nh\u1ecf nh\u1eafn, n\u1ee5 c\u01b0\u1eddi th\u00e2n thi\u1ec7n \u0111\u00f3 ch\u00ednh l\u00e0 \u1ea5n t\u01b0\u1ee3ng \u0111\u1ea7u ti\u00ean khi g\u1eb7p ch\u1ecb L\u00ea Th\u1ecb Th\u1eafng, 48 tu\u1ed5i, b\u00e0 ch\u1ee7 qu\u00e1n b\u00e1n h\u00e0ng \u0103n s\u00e1ng, th\u00e0nh vi\u00ean c\u1ee5m 39 Qu\u1ef9 T\u00ecnh th\u01b0\u01a1ng x\u00e3 Ph\u00fa Minh.

S. Yudaya is a 27-year-old business lady. She sells tomatoes, onions, green pepper, garlic, and eggplants, among other agricultural produce used in spicing both local and continental dishes. Her business is now 3 years old and she rents a stand in Namasuba-Mpida market at a fee of Ush 6,000 per month. Hardworking Yudaya wakes up at 5.00 AM every alternate day  and heads to the popular Owino market to purchase her supplies. On good days, she sells an average of Ush 20,000. Her weekly profit margin lies at approximately Ush 30,000.<p>\r\n\r\nTo boost her business, Yudaya is using the loan proceeds for purchasing more supplies like tomatoes, among other things. This reserved lady is a single mother of two children, aged 9 & 6 years. She keeps her business running amidst stiff competition by relating well with her customers and according them the courtesy they deserve.  Her major challenge in business is keeping perishable supplies fresh, considering the fact that she does not have a refrigerator. She therefore dreams of running a retail\/ wholesale shop for fast-moving consumer goods which have a long shelf life, and also educating her children to university levels.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He doesn\u2019t have any other responsibility besides his family and is able to save 1,000MT a month.\r\n\r\nHe left Inhambane to fulfill the military service which is obligatory for 2 years and lived in Matutuine to be exact in Catuane as prison guard, but because of the war he leaves the job and went to live in the capital Maputo where he studied environmental action and obtained a job at the Direction of Agriculture in the Municipality of Villa de Namaacha in the frontier with Suazilandia, as agent of irrigation service for plants, obtaining 1,900MT monthly.\r\n\r\nBesides working in agriculture, he has been working as gardener at the Church of Nossa Senhora de Fatima on Mondays, Tuesdays and Thursdays in the mornings earning 1,000MT and on Wednesdays and Saturdays at the informal market he sells construction materials in small scale. To increase the volume of his business he approached Hluvuku requesting a loan of 10,000MT.\r\n\r\nThis is his second loan with Hluvuku and his first with Kiva. The first of 6,000MT was used to improve his business (buying construction materials to sell) and the 10,000MT will be used on the same way.\r\n\r\nHe is confident he will be able to pay back on time because he also counts with his wife\u2019s help who has been hired by the Municipality of Vila de Namaacha, and he is anxious and confident in the short he will be able to build his own hardware store and farm at his house. For this he will need other loans.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Nina Delgado, Kiva

T. is 29 years old and raises dairy cows for milk production.  He sells the milk to a company that produces all types of dairy products.  At night he attends classes at the university, where he is six months away from earning his degree in veterinary medicine.  He says that he should be able to earn a good income because there are no veterinarians available who live in the nearby areas.  \r\n<p>\r\nSr. Reynaldo lives in the district of Machac Marca in Cochabamba.  It is a fairly remote area of the city, so it is difficult for him to go to a bank in order to obtain a loan.  For this reason, CIDRE took the initiative to come to this area.  He says his cows are in bad shape because he lacks a stable to shelter them during the rainy season.  With this loan, he will build a stable so that his cows are protected from the rain.  \r\n<p>\r\nSr. Reynaldo says his biggest dreams are to continue being a dairy farmer and to finish his degree.  He wants to become the best veterinarian who can, not only make money, but also provide a needed service to his community.  \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva

They sell in various restaurants and kiosks, and in schools.\nMacarena will invest this loan in materials and ingredients to make the chocolates, and in silver jewelry to expand her business.\nHer dream is to have an internet caf\u00e9 in her house or in Ingrid\u2019s, for which they are applying for a \u201ccapital semilla\u201d (seed capital) from a government program.\nMacarena\u2019s greatest motivation is her 5-year-old daughter \u2013 to assure a good economic future for her through her studies and everything she will need.\nWhat Macarena likes most about Fondo Esperanza are the good moments she lives with her group and their loan officer during the group meetings, when they do their entrepreneur-training workshops and share their experiences.\nTemuco is the capital of the Araucan\u00eda region. It is located 670 kilometres south of Santiago (the capital of Chile) and possesses a series of lake-side spa resorts and striking native flora and fauna. This region is also noteworthy for being the region where 50% of Chile's existing indigenous Mapuche community live; some of whom are members of Fondo Esperanza communal banks.\n\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4100,"image":{"id":546537,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Jewelry","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Jewelry

This is 50-year-old Marcy from Norton, about 40km from Harare. She is married, with four children ages 18, 20, 23 and 29. Three of her children are attending school. She also cares for three dependents. Marcy has been running a poultry business for 16 years. She says the main challenge she faces is bird flu which attacked the chickens during winter. Marcy has requested a loan of $300 to add layers to her stock. She says the extra income generated as a result of this loan will allow her to send her children to good schools.

The Katakal group describes their business activities: <p>\r\n\r\n\u201cThe Katakal association is a group of women from the village of Siganar.  The village has over 3,000 inhabitants, which is why an agriculture project is a good choice for helping the women to profit from the potentials of this region, from which they have earned income for over ten years.  The purpose of our group is to improve the living conditions of our members and increase their income.  The business activities planned by our group are: <p>\r\n\u2022\tAgriculture:  This is based on gardening, where the needs are: inputs (seeds, fertilizer, phytosanitary products), and equipment (watering cans, rakes, hoes, pitchforks, etc.) <p>\r\n\u2022\tCommerce:  This is the principal business activity of the group; the women take local products [i.e. fresh produce from their gardens, and perhaps handicrafts such as pottery or mats woven from palm fronds, etc.] produced by the members of the group and market them throughout the region of Ziguinchor.  They also make preserves out of fruits and vegetables.\u201d <p>\r\n\r\nOriginal French: <p>\r\n\u201cContexte du Projet : Le groupement Katakal est un groupement de femmes du village de  Siganar  Sa population compte plus de 3000habitants et c\u2019est pourquoi un projet d\u2019agriculture viendra au point pour aider les femmes \u00e0 exploiter les potentiels du milieu qu\u2019elles exploitent depuis plus de 10 ans. <p>\r\n Objectifs du Pr\u00eat : l\u2019objectif vis\u00e9 par le groupement est : <p>\r\n-  D\u2019am\u00e9liorer les conditions de vie des membres du groupement et d\u2019augmenter leur revenus. <p>\r\n Activit\u00e9s : Les activit\u00e9s que se propose le groupement sont : <p>\r\n- L\u2019agriculture : elle est bas\u00e9e sur le mara\u00eechage ou les besoins sont : les intrants (semences engrais, produits phytosanitaire), et le petit mat\u00e9riel (arrosoirs, r\u00e2teaux, p\u00e8les, houes, brouettes fourches etc.\u2026) <p>\r\n- Le commerce : Il est le principal activit\u00e9 du groupement ; de par les produits locaux produits par les membres du groupement qui assure elles m\u00eame la commercialisation de leurs produits au niveau de toute la r\u00e9gion de Ziguinchor, elles font aussi la transformation des fruits et l\u00e9gumes. \u00bb <p>\r\n\r\nBackground<p>\r\n\r\nSenegal is one of the world\u2019s poorest countries, yet its solid democratic tradition and highly developed associational life distinguish it from other countries in its income group. Especially remarkable are Senegal\u2019s networks of rotating savings and credit associations, known as tontines. Commonly organized by groups of twenty to thirty housewives who live in the same village, the tontines provide poor women throughout the country with small loans to finance modest income-generating activities. Repayment rates within these associations are excellent, because they are based on local reputation and personal trust between the members. However, their financial resources are limited to the contributions of their members, frequently subsistence farmers with very little disposable income. This has prevented the traditional tontines from meeting the demand for rural microenterprise loans and restricted their impact on the economic development of their communities. Senegal Ecovillage Microfinance (SEM) works to bridge this gap by linking traditional village credit associations with outside sources of finance.

This is 39 year old Rukia G. from Mwanza. She is widowed with three children between the ages of 14 and 17 years old. Rukia has been running a business raising kuku. \r\n\r\n\"Kuku\" means chicken in Swahili, and raising them for sale is a popular micro-business in Tanzania, especially among SELFINA clients, for a number of reasons.They require little start-up capital. You can start with one or two, and either add to them as you go, or wait for them to multiply naturally. Secondly, they require little space, so sometimes you can just let them run around in your garden or compound. Thirdly, while they are growing, they produce eggs that can either be sold to provide a supplementary source of income or eaten to provide a supplementary source of protein. \r\n\r\nRukia has had her business since 1999 and it is doing well. She works at the business for 12 hours per day, 7 days per week and is assisted by one employee. Rukia currently earns about $150 USD from her business. She is requesting a loan of $400 USD to purchase more chicken for the business. In the future, she plans to expand her business. Rukia thanks you for your support!\r\n\r\nABOUT SELFINA!\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":270318,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To purchase more chickens","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mwanza","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.516667 32.9","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-02-14T00:50:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rukia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-02-24T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-03-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:56:03Z","rounded_local_amount":52544,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130743},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-04-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:24:16Z","rounded_local_amount":52544,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027531},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-05-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:13:47Z","rounded_local_amount":52544,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613532},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-06-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:01:40Z","rounded_local_amount":52544,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010611},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-07-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:38:20Z","rounded_local_amount":52544,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63232897},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-08-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:52:23Z","rounded_local_amount":52544,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73664694},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-09-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T02:45:52Z","rounded_local_amount":52544,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87105420},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-10-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T06:26:38Z","rounded_local_amount":52544,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97022565},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-11-19T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:41:41Z","rounded_local_amount":52544,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103867814},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-12-19T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T16:44:32Z","rounded_local_amount":52543.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110757015}],"funded_date":"2009-02-14T03:21:56Z","paid_date":"2010-01-15T16:44:32Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"June Blender","image":123338}},{"id":92635,"name":"Sylvia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sylvia A., a 28-year-old young woman is married, blessed with two children, and is a very hard-working businesswoman.

Aquilina needs to improve her store and expand it in order to get more merchandise, which is why she is asking for a loan of 3000 soles.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Maya Wisnievitz, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":975,"image":{"id":291372,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Merchandise increase and improvement to her store","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-03-22T20:40:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":975,"lender_count":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Aquilina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-03-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":975,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":241.68},{"due_date":"2009-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":252.93},{"due_date":"2009-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":268.53},{"due_date":"2009-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":280.61},{"due_date":"2009-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":290.25},{"due_date":"2009-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":303.75},{"due_date":"2009-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":319.97},{"due_date":"2009-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":332.78},{"due_date":"2009-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":349.34},{"due_date":"2010-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":360.16}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.55},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.2},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.27},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.2},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":94.33},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":98.72},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":103.99},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":108.15},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":113.54},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":117.05}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":78.54,"local_amount":241.68,"processed_date":"2009-04-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:44:46Z","rounded_local_amount":247.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36012279},{"amount":82.2,"local_amount":252.93,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T00:58:00Z","rounded_local_amount":258.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44595861},{"amount":87.27,"local_amount":268.53,"processed_date":"2009-06-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:39:38Z","rounded_local_amount":274.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52990128},{"amount":91.21,"local_amount":280.61,"processed_date":"2009-07-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:41:36Z","rounded_local_amount":286.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63211254},{"amount":94.33,"local_amount":290.25,"processed_date":"2009-08-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:20:48Z","rounded_local_amount":296.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73640764},{"amount":98.72,"local_amount":303.75,"processed_date":"2009-09-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:35:02Z","rounded_local_amount":310.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87080226},{"amount":103.99,"local_amount":319.97,"processed_date":"2009-10-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:04:57Z","rounded_local_amount":327.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96996490},{"amount":108.15,"local_amount":332.78,"processed_date":"2009-11-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:54:12Z","rounded_local_amount":340.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103841998},{"amount":230.59,"local_amount":709.5,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T21:08:22Z","rounded_local_amount":725.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110733766}],"funded_date":"2009-03-22T23:17:50Z","paid_date":"2010-01-15T21:08:22Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Maya Wisnievitz","image":846125}},{"id":100827,"name":"Adwoa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Adwoa T. is 62 years old, married and the mother of ten children.

Jane dice que todo esto lo hace por sus hijos, a quienes tiene que darles lo necesario para salir adelante. Le gustan mucho sus actividades porque se distrae y se mantiene ocupada, adem\u00e1s que ambas le son rentables. Lo bueno de su venta de pollo a la parrilla es que ella misma cr\u00eda los pollos y procura que est\u00e9n en un peso y tama\u00f1o adecuado para cuando los prepare, pues as\u00ed la presentaci\u00f3n en sus platos es m\u00e1s atractiva para el cliente, porque son grandes porciones a un precio adecuado.

Every Saturday and Sunday from 9 a.m. until 4 p.m. she sells grilled food (barbecued chicken with yucca and chili), soft drinks, and beer.  Also, on Mondays through Thursdays she works in a small student cafeteria at a university near her house.  She has been doing this for six months.\r\n\r\nJane says that she does all of this for her children.  She has to give them what is needed to get ahead.\r\n\r\nShe likes her activities a lot because they entertain her and keep her busy.  Also, both are profitable.  The good thing about selling grilled chicken is that she raises the chickens herself.  She makes sure they are the right weight and size when it is time to prepare them.  This way her dishes are more appealing to her customers; they are large portions for a good price.\r\n\r\nThis is her fourth loan with MFP.  She likes working with her group.  They understand each other, help each other in their different businesses, and are punctual with their payments.  She will use the money she is now asking for to buy chicken and food for them.  Jane will have another location for a store made in her house.

They all live in the Machajmarca Zone in the city of Cochabamba.\r\nHer husband died three years ago in a car accident on the Santa Cruz \u2013 Cochabamba highway. The company he worked for gave him no death benefits because they claimed he was drunk and so was responsible for his own death. Since this time Mrs. Victoria has been responsible for her children. She is in charge of educating them and she works very hard so that her children can finish their schooling and study a career. That would be their father\u2019s desire.\r\nMrs. Victoria could really use the money that she is requesting. She will buy a cow and increase her milk production. This will increase her income, which will allow her to continue to help her children. Victoria does not receive any help. She is responsible for the progress of herself and her children.

She is 36 years old. Arlene is married and has four school-aged children. To make a living, Arlene raises poultry. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from raising chickens for sale. Arlene has been engaged in her business for more than four years and earns approximately 6000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Arlene joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. Arlene is requesting a new loan of 5000 PHP, which will be used to purchase baby chickens to raise and sell in the future. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Arlene from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Pakistan for its sweetmeats. She lives in a 3-room brick house with her family in the area called Farid town. She is a housewife, who stays at home and takes care of her household responsibilities. She is very active and receives great respect in the family for her supportive nature. She is married to M. I. who is a rickshaw driver. He provides transport services to his passengers and to school children and generates income for the family. As he is the only breadwinner for his family, this makes him even more responsible towards his work.  \r\n\r\nNajma is the mother of a 3-year-old son. She spends most of her time taking care of him. She has applied for a loan from Kiva partner Asasah for her husband\u2019s rickshaw. He will invest the loan in repairing his rickshaw because its engine is creating a problem and if it never gets repair in time it might seize up.  After the repair work, he will be able to do his job more efficiently and provide better service to his passengers. \r\n\r\nNajma is hopeful that this investment will bring good results for her husband\u2019s business and her family will be able to enjoy better living conditions. She is a new loan applicant of Asasah and hopes that it will be a good experience for her. \r\n\r\nNote: In the photo, the lady holding a book (called Asasah Passbook) in her hands is Najma.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She started the business when her husband died and she was left without an income with which to support her family.  So she began buying staple products and little by little was able to stock her grocery store. The grocery store is called \"Pulperia Yolani\" and is open from 6:00 am until 6:00 pm.

With the support of this loan, she will be able to stock her business and her clientele will not go elsewhere to buy because she will have a little of everything among her products. \r\n\r\nHer dream is to grow her business into a mini-mart and support her children so that they can finish their academic studies.

Four years ago she returned to Paraguay and with the money she had saved up she set up a small shop in her home.  In addition to tending the store, she also raises cattle and hogs.

","en":"Elda is 48 years old and lives with her husband and two sons, who help her in every way they can.  The house where they live is their own.  Her business is the sale of second-hand clothes, which she also takes to sell at a hamlet which is two days journey by boat away on the Ucayali river.  It's a very self-sacrificing job because of the long hours spent travelling and transporting her merchandise.  She sells her garments for cash and sometimes by barter, exchanging the clothes for products such as bread, bananas, yuca and maize among other things.  She had been doing this work for the last three years, and enjoys it, because although the journey by river is very tiring, it also de-stresses her and helps her to dream of a better future, as well as passing through other closer hamlets. \r\n\r\nHer business is profitable because her clothes sell like hot cakes!

She is 48 years old and attended school through the 12th grade. She doesn't have any children. She takes care of her mother and her nephew, who live in Inhambane. She sends them 1000 meticals every three months.\r\n\r\nVioleta had the opportunity to go to Germany (the former GDR) when she was in 4th grade thanks to a scholarship she received from her school, where she trained to become a typist. After the reunification of the two Germanies, she returned to Mozambique, specifically to Inhambane. But later, because of the lack of jobs, she left Inhambane with her aunt and went to the town of Namaacha. Her aunt got her a job as a typist in the high school in Namaacha, where she's worked more than 16 years from 7:30 to 15:30, earning 2960.84 meticals a month. She lives in a room in the dormitories there.\r\n\r\nHer salary is not enough to meet her needs because she is building her own house with funding requested from BIM, a commercial bank that operates in Namaacha, in the amount of 20,000 meticals. She couldn't finish it because of the high cost of materials, and approached Hluvuku and Kiva requesting a loan of 8000 meticals to continue the work, buying building supplies.\r\n\r\nThis is Violeta's second loan with Hluvuku and her first with Kiva. The first loan of 5000 meticals was used to buy building supplies, as will the current 8000-metical loan so she can finish her house. She is eager to live in her own home. She is confident that she will have no trouble paying off the loan and be able to request a new loan to do upkeep on the house.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Andrea Rosenberg, Kiva

For the time being, they live in their parents\u2019 home. He is a very hard-working man who has been providing public transportation services full-time for 10 years. Thanks to his efforts, he now owns three motorcycle taxis. His wife is the one who is in charge of handling the business finances because he admits that she is much better at it than he is. Rodolfo drives one of the motorcycle taxis, while he hired two other drivers to drive the other taxis. However, his wish to keep making progress is so big that he also utilizes his artistic skills in his free time by making necklaces, earrings, hoops, and bracelets out of local material in the indigenous zone (the Peruvian jungle). He has an advantage because he lives in a tourist section, which means that his jewelry sells well because he is a street vendor. Rodolfo is concerned with being an active and healthy person so that he can continue with his work. He is very pleased with what he has managed up to now for the benefit of his family. This is the first time that he requests a loan with MFP. Ever since he first got in touch with his microfinance institute, he has been happy to work with people who are united and responsible. With this loan that he is requesting, he will have his motorcycle taxis repaired and maintained.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Elizabeth Casian, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":380637,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Motorcycle Transport","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"Repair motorcycle taxis","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:45Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":275,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rodolfo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-08-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":800,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":121.76},{"due_date":"2009-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":125.55},{"due_date":"2009-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":129.07},{"due_date":"2009-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":136.31},{"due_date":"2010-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":140.8},{"due_date":"2010-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":146.51}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.86},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.15},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.37},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.86},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.4},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.36}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":41.86,"local_amount":121.76,"processed_date":"2009-09-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:39:28Z","rounded_local_amount":123.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87081301},{"amount":43.15,"local_amount":125.55,"processed_date":"2009-10-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:14:54Z","rounded_local_amount":126.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96997452},{"amount":44.37,"local_amount":129.07,"processed_date":"2009-11-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:55:53Z","rounded_local_amount":130.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103842797},{"amount":145.62,"local_amount":423.62,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T21:05:47Z","rounded_local_amount":428.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734374}],"funded_date":"2009-09-07T01:43:34Z","paid_date":"2010-01-15T21:05:47Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Elizabeth Casian","image":845142}},{"id":137758,"name":"Muhaiyo","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"A.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

T. is a 45-year-old married man from the village of Bliss, Aurora Zamboanga del Sur, in the Philippines.  He has 4 school-age children. To earn a living, Uldarico owns and operates a business venture in the food sector.  Specifically, he runs a \"carenderia\" -- i.e., a mini restaurant.  At the carenderia, his income is primarily derived from serving a variety of different meals to customers from his local community.  Uldarico has been engaged in this business for over 2 years, and he earns approximately 5,500 PHP per month from these activities. <p>\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Uldarico joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services and to thereby help improve his living situation as well as his ability to engage in business activities.  Notably, Uldarico has already successfully repaid a previous loan from GDMPC in the amount of 20,000 PHP, which was used to purchase additional inventory and for working capital.  Uldarico is now requesting a new loan in the amount of 20,000 PHP ($450), which will be used to purchase food and drinks for the mini restaurant.  This loan will be the fifth loan taken out by Uldarico from GDMPC.  He plans to use the additional revenue generated as a result of this loan to improve and expand his business and to pay for his children's school tuition. <p>\r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC: GDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.  It has four branches and three unit offices, covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte, and Misamis Occidental.  Its membership is mostly comprised of farmers, fishermen, and entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":410456,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists, and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture, and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\nIMON's History\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Her husband, Larry, is a fisherman and they are blessed with 4 children who are between 18 and 24 years old. Her dream is for her children to earn their college degrees and get a good job, so that they can enjoy a comfortable life.\r\n\r\nTo help her husband achieve this dream, she sold her husband's daily fish catch either within their community or in the nearby villages. Her hard work and perseverance bore fruit so that she needed new capital just to maintain her sales volume. This inspired her to join NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1991 so that she could continuously access new capital for her business.\r\n\r\nWith new capital, she was able to expand the product lines in her general store; her business activities have been a big help in supporting all of the needs of their family, slowly improving their living conditions. As her business improved, she also engaged in food vending, which she put up in front of her general store. Now she earns about PHP 19,200 per month, which she adds to her revolving working capital and she saves most of her income for the education of her children.\r\n\r\nHer previous loan of PHP 29,500 contributed a lot in developing her business and even her performance in NWTF-PD, maintaining her good credit record. The said amount was fully paid on-time without any delay. As Center Chief, her good credit performance makes her a good example to her members. Now in her 19th cycle, she is borrowing the same amount of PHP 19,500 to be used to obtain additional capital for her general store and for the repair of her pumpboat.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress out of earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":439034,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

Ella trabaja todos los d\u00edas arduamente, para que al llegar la temporada de cosechar sus productos sean grandes y pueda venderlos en el mercado mayorista de la ciudad de Tarma.\nLo que m\u00e1s le gusta de su trabajo es la libertad que tiene en el desempe\u00f1o de su labor, ya que ella decide qu\u00e9 es lo mejor para sus cultivos. Lleva 8 a\u00f1os realizando esta actividad y considera que lo m\u00e1s dif\u00edcil es transportar sus productos hasta el mercado, ya que la mayor\u00eda de veces le es muy dif\u00edcil conseguir un carro que quiera llevarla.

She lives in her own house with her husband Roger, who is 27, and her daughter, who is 5.  They are the motive for all her efforts.\r\n\r\nThe activity she dedicates herself to is cultivation of corn, potatoes, peas, etc., on the farms she inherited from her parents.  She works arduously every day so that when harvest season comes, her products will be mature and she can sell them in the wholesale market at Tarma.\r\n\r\nWhat she likes best about her work is the freedom she has in carrying out her labor, since she decides what is best for her crops.  Jussely has been doing this for 8 years and the task she considers most difficult is transporting her products to market.  Most of the time, it is very difficult to find a cart driver that is willing to do it.  In the future, she hopes to have a post in the market.  She is sure that this will improve her economic income.\r\n\r\nThis is Jussely's 7th loan with MFP and she knows that she has to be punctual in her payments, as she was with her previous loans.

He demonstrates this with his coffee crops, where he applies all of his knowledge. He relates that, in order to renew and improve his plantings, he needs an average of 8 thousand nuevos soles. He needs a little more to have even, good quality beans. That is why at every harvest he sells his beans to the cooperative of Alto Palomar where he is a member. He is looking for a better bean. In addition, he is planting plantains as an alternative crop, to ensure his income. Every two weeks he picks the ripe fruit to sell it. He has been doing this for 20 years, but states that before he didn't have the knowledge that he has now. That is why he is sure that he will attain his goal, buying more arable land.

This $750 loan will benefit four other entrepreneurs and their businesses along with Fiordaliza\u2019s. They formed their \"Banco de Esperanza\" (Bank of Hope), went through business training and will repay their loan together. If one person is struggling to pay on time in full, their group will help to make up the difference.\r\n<\/p>\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":19865,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Replenish inventory and pay expenses","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"DO","country":"Dominican Republic","town":"Los Alcarrizos","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"18.516667 -70.016667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":44,"posted_date":"2007-03-17T23:16:00Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":750,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Fiordaliza","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-04-01T11:32:20Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":750,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2007-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2007-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2007-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2007-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2007-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2007-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2007-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":125}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":125,"local_amount":125,"processed_date":"2007-05-24T20:00:51Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-01T22:33:18Z","rounded_local_amount":125,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":17144},{"amount":125,"local_amount":125,"processed_date":"2007-05-24T20:01:09Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-01T22:33:18Z","rounded_local_amount":125,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":17157},{"amount":250,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2007-07-01T09:20:18Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-01T22:33:18Z","rounded_local_amount":250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27975},{"amount":125,"local_amount":125,"processed_date":"2007-08-01T09:21:44Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-01T22:33:18Z","rounded_local_amount":125,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":37772},{"amount":125,"local_amount":125,"processed_date":"2007-09-01T09:22:00Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-01T22:33:18Z","rounded_local_amount":125,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":49173},{"amount":125,"local_amount":125,"processed_date":"2007-10-01T09:20:15Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-01T22:33:18Z","rounded_local_amount":125,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":61378}],"funded_date":"2007-03-18T11:32:20Z","paid_date":"2007-10-01T09:20:15Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":10723,"name":"Juliana","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Juliana is married with four children; she had ten but six are deceased.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women and uses the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets; thus they are deemed non-creditworthy by financial institutions.

Her husband has a business processing \u201c<a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Phytelephas\" target=\"_blank\" >tagua<\/a>\u201d (the hard white coating of a specific palm seed that is used as a substitute for elephant ivory), which he buys at the port of Manta.

Tania says she wants to finish her studies and graduate from beauty school to become a stylist since she would very much like to have that profession.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":544147,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"Purchase \"tagua\" (a substitute for elephant ivory)","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Portoviejo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2010-06-04T10:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Tania Gabriela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-04-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":550,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2010-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2010-06-29T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2010-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2010-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2010-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2010-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2010-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2010-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2010-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2010-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":45.87}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":183.32,"local_amount":183.32,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:47:10Z","rounded_local_amount":183.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151892538},{"amount":91.66,"local_amount":91.66,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:10:43Z","rounded_local_amount":91.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159632884},{"amount":91.66,"local_amount":91.66,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:15:04Z","rounded_local_amount":91.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166846918},{"amount":91.66,"local_amount":91.66,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:07:26Z","rounded_local_amount":91.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172113379},{"amount":45.83,"local_amount":45.83,"processed_date":"2010-10-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T13:57:36Z","rounded_local_amount":45.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177406958},{"amount":45.87,"local_amount":45.87,"processed_date":"2010-10-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T13:58:50Z","rounded_local_amount":45.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177406959}],"funded_date":"2010-06-04T13:23:22Z","paid_date":"2010-11-15T13:58:50Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ronan Reodica","image":498323}},{"id":208233,"name":"Nimer","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Nimer is a 32 year old married Lebanese entrepreneur.

She is an extremely hardworking woman who lives in her own home with her husband Teodoro, age 34, and their three beloved children for whom she wants to provide a better life.  Clotilde and her husband work together every day on their land.  Through much effort, they have been able to make their land productive so that they can grow a little bit of everything.  They know that whatever they produce will be of quality.  Clotilde grows primarily cacao, coffee, turmeric, and coca leaves.  These products are in great demand at the market.  What she enjoys most about her work is protecting her crops from plagues of insects that could negatively impact them.  On some occasions, she is not able to achieve a sufficient harvest and thereby earns less income.  Clotilde has been farming for twelve years and considers the most difficult part to be transporting her crops to the city of San Francisco to be sold.  In the future, she hopes to save the necessary funds to buy additional farmland.\r\n\r\nThis is the fifth loan Clotilde has received from MFP.  She feels that this loan will be a great help in developing her business.  Clotilde is known in her Communal Bank for being a very responsible member, a distinction of which she is proud.  The loan she requested will be used to buy traps and insecticides for combating pests that are attacking her crops.

In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a Php5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She makes money by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She makes a minimum of Php 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php 12,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nAngela dreams to be able to give her whole family a good future through all her hard work in her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay Micro Finance

Meet Esther, a hardworking, dedicated and honest 46-year-old dairy farmer. As the key breadwinner of her family, with a husband and three children, she farms a small plot of land in the green, lush hills of Chuka, in the central region of Kenya. For the past ten years, she has been practicing mixed farming and her primary source of income has been milk, eggs and crop selling. She also engages in a small business to supplement the meager income she earns through farming. \nEsther passionately loves dairy farming but the biggest challenge she faces is feeding her cows and satisfying the largely unsatisfied milk market. She is seeking a loan to build a modern dairy unit and to buy a chaff cutter. The dairy unit will assist Esther in managing her cows well and also protecting them from the harsh weather conditions. Esther also intends to buy a chaff cutter which is a mechanical device that is used in cutting hay into smaller pieces so that cows wont refuse any part of the food. The selling price for milk is 40 Kenya shillings per liter and through this loan she will be making more money. Esther will increase her income from milk selling and her cows will have more food to eat and never reject food. The key to high yield in milk production is proper feeding of the cows and through this loan, Esther will achieve this. An increase in income will allow Esther to improve her living conditions and secure the future of her children. Her dream is to continue improving her dairy breeds and increase milk productivity to achieve better living standards. Esther fears that her dreams might not be realized if Juhudi Kilimo and Kiva lenders cease to provide their reliable market channel, credit facility and services that she requires to grow her dairy enterprise.\n\nYou can help Esther to be closer to her goals, and a loan will do that.\n"}},"status":"inactive","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":2038652,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To build a modern dairy unit and buy a chaffcutter","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Chuka","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-0.333333 37.65","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Esther","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-12-04T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":100000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":4300.81},{"due_date":"2016-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":4426.5},{"due_date":"2016-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":4555.87},{"due_date":"2016-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":4689.01},{"due_date":"2016-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":4826.05},{"due_date":"2016-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":4967.09},{"due_date":"2016-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":5112.25},{"due_date":"2016-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":5261.66},{"due_date":"2016-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":5415.43},{"due_date":"2016-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":5573.7},{"due_date":"2016-11-04T07:00:00Z","amount":5736.59},{"due_date":"2016-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":5904.24},{"due_date":"2017-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":6076.79},{"due_date":"2017-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":6254.38},{"due_date":"2017-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":6437.17},{"due_date":"2017-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":6625.3},{"due_date":"2017-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":6818.92},{"due_date":"2017-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":7018.24}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.01},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.27},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.56},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.89},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.26},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.67},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.12},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.62},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.15},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.74},{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.37},{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.04},{"due_date":"2017-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.77},{"due_date":"2017-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.54},{"due_date":"2017-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.37},{"due_date":"2017-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.25},{"due_date":"2017-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.19},{"due_date":"2017-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.18}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":2547,"name":"Komi","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mr. Komi G. was born in 1967 at Ah\u00e9p\u00e9 Akposso in the prefecture of Yoto.

As a result of her self-sacrificing work and the care that she brings to each one of her young cows, she has been able to increase the quantity of her calves so that now she is able to give her children the opportunity to pursue university studies, which apart from everything fill her with pride and much satisfaction.  Her next desire is to move into the business of buying and selling cheese, milk, and beef.  This business would generate enough additional income to sustain her home and to enable her to pay the university costs of her beloved children.  In order to meet her goals Fortunata is relying on your generous heart and asks for a loan in order to begin this new occupation without delay.  Fortunata awaits your response in order to finalize her plans and to make her dreams of seeing her dear children become professionals a reality.\r\n<p><b>Translated from Spanish by Debra Faszer-McMahon, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\nFortunata tiene 48 a\u00f1os y es una amorosa madre  de tres hijos; desde que form\u00f3 su familia junto a F\u00e9lix, se dedic\u00f3 a la labor ganadera, trabajo que desempe\u00f1a hasta el d\u00eda de hoy con mucho amor y  paciencia; como recompensa a su abnegado trabajo y  al cuidado que les brinda a cada una de sus generosas vaquitas ha logrado acrecentar la cantidad de sus terneritos con el que ahora puede  brindarles a sus hijos la oportunidad de seguir sus estudios universitarios que  menci\u00f3n aparte la llenan de orgullo y mucha satisfacci\u00f3n.Su pr\u00f3ximo deseo es incursionar en el negocio de compra y venta de queso, leche y carne; negocio que le generar\u00e1  ingresos econ\u00f3micos adicionales para el sustento de su hogar  y con el que terminar\u00e1 de cubrir  los gastos de estudios superiores  de sus queridos hijos.Para  concretar sus objetivos la se\u00f1ora  Fortunata recurre a tu generoso coraz\u00f3n  y solicita un pr\u00e9stamo para iniciar sin demora esta nueva ocupaci\u00f3n. \u201cFortunata espera por tu pronta respuesta para concretar sus planes  y hacer realidad los  sue\u00f1os de  ver profesionales a sus queridos hijos\u201d"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":80535,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Capital investment in order to begin a new business with the help of her dear calves.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Juliaca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15.5 -70.133333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2007-11-02T09:05:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Fortunata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-11-16T14:25:33Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":142.86},{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":142.86},{"due_date":"2008-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":142.86},{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":142.86},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":142.86},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":142.86},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":142.84}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":50}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":50,"local_amount":142.86,"processed_date":"2007-12-16T20:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-16T09:28:05Z","rounded_local_amount":150.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":108762},{"amount":50,"local_amount":142.86,"processed_date":"2008-01-16T10:15:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-16T09:28:05Z","rounded_local_amount":150.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":116648},{"amount":50,"local_amount":142.86,"processed_date":"2008-02-16T10:15:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-16T09:28:05Z","rounded_local_amount":150.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136488},{"amount":50,"local_amount":142.86,"processed_date":"2008-03-16T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-16T09:28:05Z","rounded_local_amount":150.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159228},{"amount":50,"local_amount":142.86,"processed_date":"2008-04-16T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-16T09:28:05Z","rounded_local_amount":150.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":183997},{"amount":50,"local_amount":142.86,"processed_date":"2008-05-16T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-16T09:28:05Z","rounded_local_amount":150.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211557},{"amount":50,"local_amount":142.86,"processed_date":"2008-06-16T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-16T09:28:05Z","rounded_local_amount":150.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":239708}],"funded_date":"2007-11-02T13:25:33Z","paid_date":"2008-06-16T09:09:35Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":27124,"name":"Martha","description":{"languages":["es"],"texts":{"es":"Sra.

With the money she requests she will buy groceries to stock in her store, such as rice, sugar, and tins of milk.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Shaun Haines, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":291467,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Stocking up staple goods in her store","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"HUANCAYO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.066667 -75.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-03-22T23:30:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sandra","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-03-03T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2009-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2009-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2009-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2009-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2009-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2009-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2009-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":125}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.62},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.62},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.62},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.62},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.62},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.62},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.62},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.66}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":40.62,"local_amount":125,"processed_date":"2009-04-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:43:11Z","rounded_local_amount":127.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36012301},{"amount":40.62,"local_amount":125,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T00:58:39Z","rounded_local_amount":127.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44595883},{"amount":40.62,"local_amount":125,"processed_date":"2009-06-08T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:39:05Z","rounded_local_amount":127.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52990150},{"amount":40.62,"local_amount":125,"processed_date":"2009-07-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:39:47Z","rounded_local_amount":127.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63211276},{"amount":40.62,"local_amount":125,"processed_date":"2009-08-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:19:05Z","rounded_local_amount":127.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73640786},{"amount":40.62,"local_amount":125,"processed_date":"2009-09-08T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:32:52Z","rounded_local_amount":127.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87080248},{"amount":40.62,"local_amount":125,"processed_date":"2009-10-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:01:01Z","rounded_local_amount":127.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96996496},{"amount":40.66,"local_amount":125,"processed_date":"2009-11-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:53:38Z","rounded_local_amount":127.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103842004}],"funded_date":"2009-03-23T01:44:52Z","paid_date":"2009-12-15T13:53:38Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Shaun Haines","image":55908}},{"id":100875,"name":"Fely","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Fely P. is from Tudela, Misamis Occidental.

These items are procured at the grand marketplace of Koutiala.  Following the off-season, the crops are stored for a time, so that they gain in value.  And then they are sold at the same marketplace and at surrounding marketplaces at the retail level (often wholesale), in cash transactions, to customers generally from large cities.\r\n\r\nThe group members each intend to realize, after selling their produce, an average profit of 50,000 francs CFA, which will be used to repay the loan and to cover common family expenses.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":975,"image":{"id":329685,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"To buy fertilizers, seeds, and minor supplies and equipment ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Koutiala","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:23Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":975,"lender_count":33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Denise","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Salimata Andr\u00e9 ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rose ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Djen\u00e8 Abou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Awa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Anique ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Noumousso ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatouma ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Agnesse Filbert ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Delphine Eug\u00e9nie  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-05-05T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":440000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":975,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":440000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":975}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":975,"local_amount":440000,"processed_date":"2010-01-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:36:04Z","rounded_local_amount":451322.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118152128}],"funded_date":"2009-07-08T08:05:13Z","paid_date":"2010-02-15T12:36:04Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Daniel Kuey","image":669418}},{"id":117259,"name":"Mary Kim","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mary Kim D.

She is a single mother of two children who completed 9th grade. In the past, Blanca has received two previous loans of 500,000 colones,each that were repaid on time and in full. This will be her third loan from Fundacion Mujer and she is happy to be applying for a larger amount than she has in the past (650,000 colones).\r\n\r\nThe name of Blanca\u00b4s business is \"Confecciones M.\" (M. Apparel). Blanca makes and alters clothing. Her specialty is creating children's pajamas. She makes more profit from selling pajamas than from other types of clothing. She also makes women\u2019s clothes (blouses, skirts) and offers various customized products.\r\n\r\nBlanca sells her clothes to a distributor who comes to her home in Santa Barabara every 15 days. The distributor purchases children\u2019s pajamas (for ages 12 and under) and women\u2019s clothing to sell throughout Costa Rica. Blanca has been in this business for 20 years. She opened her business with an initial investment of 125,000 colones from loans from a friend and her sister. In a good month, she can earn 500,000 colones; in a bad month, only 300,000. Blanca plans to use this loan to purchase raw materials and invest in a new sewing machine.\r\n\r\nBlanca has been sewing all her life. She has been making clothes for as long as she can remember. She is a hard-working woman who dedicates 12 hours each day to her business. The income she earns from sewing is the only source of income for her family. Her goal is to open a boutique where she can sell children's clothes. \r\n\r\nDue to the high costs of raw materials, Blanca has not been able to re-invest in her business. Her lack of necessities, such as elastic, fabrics, sewing thread, and other raw materials, have hampered her businesses growth. This loan will enable Blanca to purchase larger quantities of raw materials from her suppliers in San Jose. By purchasing in volume, she is confident that she will be able to secure better prices. With this loan, Blanca hopes to generate more income and provide a higher standard of living for her children.

She works six days a week in a semi-urban area on the outskirts of Kampala.  She serves an average of 10 customers a day and sells to all categories of people at retail and wholesale prices.

Her major business challenge is transportation of bales of products like mats, tablecloths, and hats.   Assa has been in this business for five years and with MCDT for twelve years. She is currently on her twelfth loan, working with the same group mates. Assa joined MCDT because it was near her home and was working with poor women.

Despite the difficult economic situation that he has gone through, he has managed to support his family and provide his five children with everything they need. To develop his business, Bekmurod has made use of loans provided by IMON International, which he has used toward technical assistance for his crops. \r\n\r\nOnce again, Bekmurod seeks loan support from IMON International to invest in his crops, later raise his harvest, and survive along with his family. With your help, Bekmurod will be able to get ahead.    \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Meet Emily, a mother of two lovely children aged 13 and 7. Emily is based in Kimaring, a remote village in the rich highland areas of Kapsowar area of Kenya. This area is known for producing the best milk and their staple food is \u201cmursik,\u201d a mouthwatering delicacy prepared from milk. Emily has been practicing mixed farming for the past 4 years and she has made great strides in terms of profit margins. This small scale farmer generates income through selling milk, poultry, crops and some personal business that she does, or \u201cside hustle\u201d as she likes to call it. She passionately loves poultry farming and the best part is when she wakes up every morning to collect eggs. The main challenge facing Emily is the constant perennial shortages of eggs and poultry products in her village and local market. She seeks to change this through borrowing a loan and buying more poultry. Emily is seeking a loan from Kiva lenders via Juhudi Kilimo to purchase additional poultry. With the loan, Emily will increase her income through selling eggs, poultry meat and also poultry feathers. The demand for poultry products in Kapsowar area is very high and through the loan she will be able to satisfy the demand.
