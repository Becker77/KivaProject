Chanthou N. is a villager in Mea Neak village in Takeo province. She is a farmer who owns a 7-hectare field to cultivate rice for a living. On this farm, she faces a problem because she does not have enough equipment to plow the field so she decided to ask for a loan to buy an electric cow to plow the field.

in 1959 in Khdrants village, there he graduated from Agarak village high school and then enrolled in and graduated from Kapan Vocational School.  Emin is a lathe operator by profession.  Emin is married and has a son and two daughters.  The son is married and lives separately from the parents.  The daughters are also married and each lives separately from the parents with her family.  Emin's wife helps him a lot with managing the household.  Emin works as a forester in the Kapan forest.  \n\nIn addition to working in his profession Emin has also been working in agriculture since 1994 in Khdrants village.  He owns livestock, chickens, pigs, bees and a garden where he grows vegetables.  Emin also has a plot of land where he diligently grows wheat.  He has regular customers in Kapan city who purchase vegetables that he grows as well as beef, pork, honey, eggs and milk.  Since a forester's salary is low the earnings from the sale of agricultural products help Emin to support his family and also to help the families of his children. Emin needs a loan of 600,000 dram for planting (purchase a new variety of grain, diesel fuel), which will significantly improve the performance of his agricultural products.

He always said his wife cooked better and that\u2019s how she got them to hire her for an event.  That\u2019s how it took off and she became known.  She started in this business with her good seasoning and the help of her mother.  She made her own personal cards offering her services to every person she knew.  She advertised herself  and the results were good because they began calling her from all over.  They hire her for birthday parties, anniversaries, events, etc.\r\nIn the summer she also helps herself because she gets contracts from families for their summer houses.  She makes a good profit for this.  She also sells Herbalife products.  All these jobs help her cover her needs and those of her 2 children.  She is separated and she supports them herself.  Marisol likes cooking a lot and she feels happy.  She is already thinking of opening her own restaurant in the future where she could wait on all her customers.  What she is doing now is temporary.  She wants something safe and stable.  She knows that she\u2019ll have her children\u2019s and EDAPROSPO\u2019s help con this project.  She\u2019s thankful for the organization because she has achieved a lot of things.  She\u2019ll use her current loan to buy Herbalife products because she has many products to deliver to her customers.\r\n*Mrs. Marisol F. is the one with the gray shirt.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Susan Haynes, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2325,"image":{"id":450691,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"PURCHASE HERBALIFE PRODUCTS","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":93,"posted_date":"2009-12-17T22:10:20Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2325,"lender_count":64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Aurora De Los Santos","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Aurora ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yude Segundina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gladis","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marisol","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Aydee","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Flor De Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Luz Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Genoveva Magdalena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Milagros Ursula ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-12-09T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":6700,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":2325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":1675},{"due_date":"2010-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":1675},{"due_date":"2010-03-09T08:00:00Z","amount":1675},{"due_date":"2010-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1675}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":581.25},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":581.25},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":581.25},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":581.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":581.25,"local_amount":1675,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:15:27Z","rounded_local_amount":1682.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118064609},{"amount":581.25,"local_amount":1675,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T09:46:26Z","rounded_local_amount":1682.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123899668},{"amount":581.25,"local_amount":1675,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T08:44:52Z","rounded_local_amount":1682.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128933751},{"amount":581.25,"local_amount":1675,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:07:58Z","rounded_local_amount":1682.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136661347}],"funded_date":"2009-12-29T04:55:00Z","paid_date":"2010-05-15T10:07:58Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sue Haynes","image":null}},{"id":167117,"name":"Sandra Patricia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Sandra es cliente nueva, se dedica a la elaboracion de tarjetas de navidad y un sin fin de adornos utilizando goma eva, pintura, escarcha y cartulina, esta actividad no solo la realiza por la epoca de navidad sino tambien para fiestas infantiles y otros acontecimientos, en realidad esta actividad la realiza todo el a\u00f1o con distintas actividades.

Freddy plans to use part of the funds for vehicle maintenance and part for his driver's licence renewal so that he can continue to drive problem-free.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":487200,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Motorcycle Transport","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"For vehicle service and maintenance.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"HUANCAYO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.066667 -75.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-02-13T00:10:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Freddy","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-01-29T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2010-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2010-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2010-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2010-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2010-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2010-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2010-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":125}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":43.75,"local_amount":125,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:33:24Z","rounded_local_amount":126.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128993219},{"amount":43.75,"local_amount":125,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:38:07Z","rounded_local_amount":126.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136718002},{"amount":43.75,"local_amount":125,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:40:03Z","rounded_local_amount":126.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144751678},{"amount":43.75,"local_amount":125,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:02:58Z","rounded_local_amount":126.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151934143},{"amount":43.75,"local_amount":125,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:36:59Z","rounded_local_amount":126.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159672918},{"amount":43.75,"local_amount":125,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:40:01Z","rounded_local_amount":126.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166886702},{"amount":43.75,"local_amount":125,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:25:21Z","rounded_local_amount":126.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172153806},{"amount":43.75,"local_amount":125,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T15:13:51Z","rounded_local_amount":126.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177449205}],"funded_date":"2010-02-14T03:58:55Z","paid_date":"2010-11-15T15:13:51Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":179782,"name":"Ren","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Ren U. is a 29 year-old married woman who lives in Prey Run village in Takeo province.

She is 33 years old, married, and has three school-aged children. To make a living, Rona owns and operates a sari-sari (variety) retail shop, selling both food and daily use products in the local community. She has been engaged in her business for over two years and earns approximately $88 a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Rona joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Rona is requesting a new loan of 8,000 PHP which will be used to invest in expanding her business. This will be her 2nd loan from HSPFI.

This area is characterized by its distressed ecology. Due to lack of opportunities, he started working in a bakery at a young age to make his own income. When he grew up, he decided that this would be his main job. He bought a small oven and started to make bread and sell it throughout the area. He now makes breads and red donuts from flour (pictured in the photo) for his customers from 8:00 until nightfall. In order to continue with his business and speed up his production, he wants to purchase machines with his loan. In the future he wants to finish building his home, which is currently made of bamboo.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Christine Cooper, Kiva

The group is made up of four women who know one another and are neighbors. They are:\r\n\r\nMs. Mar\u00eda de Lourdes C. V. - she will use her loan to buy jugs of purified water to stock her business;\r\n\r\nMs. Mar\u00eda Magdalena F. M. - she will buy earrings and bracelets to stock her business;\r\n\r\nMs. Ana Mar\u00eda M\u00e9ndez Hern\u00e1ndez - she will buy sandals, shoes, sneakers, and cowboy boots to stock her business; and\r\n\r\nMs. Rosa F. God\u00ednez - she will buy <i>jitomates<\/i>, onions, tomatoes, chilies, lettuce, and fruits to stock her business.\r\n\r\nMs. Mar\u00eda de Lourdes C. V. is 42 years old. She studied one year of primary school. She lives in a common-law marriage and has three sons: Miguel, 25, is married and works; Aurelia, 24, went to work in the United States; and Martha Patricia, 23, went to work in the United States.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda has a business grinding <i>nixtamal<\/i> [dried corn] and selling dough, jugs of purified water, and soft drinks. She is requesting this loan to buy jugs of purified water, corn, and cases of soft drinks. Her business is called \"Molina El Rey\" [\"The King's Mill\"]. She offers her clients milling services and she sells jugs of purified water and soft drinks. She started her business 20 years ago because there wasn't anyone selling goods there, since  it was a new settlement. She started by selling purified water and soft drinks, and a year ago, her husband bought the mill so they could start the business of selling dough and grinding nixtamal or chilies for <i>mole<\/i> [a traditional Mexican stew or soup]. Her brother-in-law and her son, who work in a tortilla factory fixing the machines, taught her how to use the mill. Her brother-in-law got the mill for her and although it is small, she was able to start her business with savings from a time when she had gone to Cuernavaca.\r\n\r\nIt was her husband who gave her the idea to sell goods. They bought merchandise with money they had earned previously. The business is located in their house and it is important because it brings in money for food. Mar\u00eda's husband helps her to stock her business and to bring things, as well as to grind and deliver the corn. Her favorite part of her business is milling and selling dough. She is proud that her mill grinds well, and it is small and pretty. \r\n\r\nHer customers are her neighbors. Her business is popular because their town is small and hers is the only mill. She keeps her earnings so that if the mill breaks she can buy parts, and she also uses them to pay for electricity. She is planning to expand her business by selling sodas, and on Saturdays and Sundays she will sell <i>pozole<\/i>, crispy tortillas, and tacos. She would also like to start a small grocery store and she thinks she will be able to achieve this with her loan.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda's business, along with her husband's income and the money her children send, has helped her family to eat. Sometimes, when her husband is without work, he fetches the tortillas, eggs, or whatever else.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda hopes to make the following improvements to her home: flatten the ground and install a floor. Her hopes and plans are to see her grandchildren grow up and for them to have a better life; and for her children to not suffer and to be in good health.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda de Lourdes is excited about this loan because she will use it to invest. She is also nervous because sometimes she doesn't have enough money, but with God's help she is going to move forward with her business. The improvements she hopes to make in the future are as follows: to leave her children something, to expand her business, and for her children to keep working.\r\n\r\nThe members of this group want to tell Kiva and Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad: \"Thank you for having faith in us. Thank you because we will now invest in our businesses and we hope that you will continue supporting us.\"\r\n\r\nAnenecuilco is a calm, tranquil village with a view of the hills. It is home to the Emiliano Zapata Museum, since it is where he was born. It holds some of his writings and belongings that he used, and it shows a movie about the history of General Emiliano Zapata, whose motto was: \u201cThe land belongs to those who work it.\u201d"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1500,"image":{"id":717393,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy jugs of purified water, corn, and cases of soft drinks","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"ANENECUILCO MORELOS","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2011-03-04T08:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1500,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda De Lourdes","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ma Magdalena ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ana Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-02-15T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":18000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":1500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":2250},{"due_date":"2011-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":2250},{"due_date":"2011-03-29T07:00:00Z","amount":2250},{"due_date":"2011-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":2250},{"due_date":"2011-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":2250},{"due_date":"2011-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":2250},{"due_date":"2011-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":2250},{"due_date":"2011-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":2250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":187.5},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":187.5},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":187.5},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":187.5},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":187.5},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":187.5},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":187.5},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":187.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":562.5,"local_amount":6750,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:10:27Z","rounded_local_amount":6808.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201292477},{"amount":375,"local_amount":4500,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:09:01Z","rounded_local_amount":4538.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206160735},{"amount":432.07,"local_amount":5184.89,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:21:49Z","rounded_local_amount":5229.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211233609},{"amount":130.43,"local_amount":1565.11,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:12:12Z","rounded_local_amount":1578.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216512433}],"funded_date":"2011-03-06T16:53:12Z","paid_date":"2011-07-15T11:12:12Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Katie Kavanagh","image":847206}},{"id":282428,"name":"Fatuma","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Fatuma N. has operated a clothes-selling business for four years, and she works seven days a week.

is a young man who is 32 years old. He lives with his wife and young who attends school. He began selling used clothing in the street. He was able to purchase the clothing from other vendors at a lower price, and then turn a small profit. He would also sell this clothing door-to-door, and as he did so, he realized that he could learn to tailor clothing himself. To perfect his skills, he traveled to the capitol. When he returned to his native city Pucallpa and with the help of his wife, he set up a modest shop where he began working doing what he enjoyed most. He was then able to partner with one of his aunts to open a clothing sales and tailoring stand in a commercial center located on a major avenue of the city. Thanks to his knowledge and experience tailoring clothes, his business has improved. Nevertheless, there are orders, which he falls behind on for lack of cloth and material. Because of this, Jhon is requesting a $200 loan, which he has agreed to repay in 6 months. He will use the money to purchase material and supplies to meet the demands of his business, so that he can reach his goal of having his own stand as soon as possible and meet the needs of his home.  <p> <b>Translated from Spanish by James Comstock, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p> \r\n\r\nJhon es un joven de 32 a\u00f1os, vive con su esposa y un peque\u00f1o ni\u00f1o  que est\u00e1 estudiando, \u00e9l empez\u00f3 vendiendo en la calle  prendas que adquir\u00eda tambi\u00e9n de otros comerciantes a menor precio con el fin de tener una peque\u00f1a ganancia, tambi\u00e9n iba  ofreciendo estas prendas caminando y tocando puertas, con el pasar del tiempo se di\u00f3 cuenta que el pod\u00eda aprender a confeccionar las ropas que vend\u00eda y para hacerlo  tuvo que viajar a la capital a perfeccionar su idea. \r\n\r\nCuando retorn\u00f3 a su ciudad natal Pucallpa puso un peque\u00f1o y modesto taller empezando a trabajar en lo que m\u00e1s le gusta con la ayuda de su esposa y lograron asociarse con una de sus  t\u00edas para poner un stand de venta y confecci\u00f3n de ropas en un centro comercial  ubicado en una importante  avenida de esta ciudad.Gracias a los conocimientos  y experiencia en la confecci\u00f3n de prendas de vestir, el negocio est\u00e1 mejorando sin embargo hay pedidos que son entregados con un leve retraso por  falta de telas y materiales.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services

However, since she had 2 children, she could not work far away from home and as a result, her income decreased.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

an hour and a half from the city of Cusco. She is forty-eight years old and married with five children.\r\n\r\nCirila makes dairy products at home from the milk that her cows produce. Every weekend she sells cheeses at the Huancaro market in Cusco for 2 to 3 soles (approximately 75 cents to $1). Right now the space she has to keep her cows is too small.

Gulchehra is a 47-year-old woman. She is married and is the mother of five children.\r\n\r\nGulchehra is a farmer. She has land where she plants crops like wheat, onions, carrots and rice. As a rule, Gulchehra and her son, who is also engaged in her farm business, grow sufficient crops for the consumption of the family and for selling.\r\n\r\nToday, in applying to IMON for the 3,000 Somoni loan, Gulchehra hopes to produce a rich yield that she will sell in the market at prices attractive to the population. She is planning to purchase seeds and fertilizer.\r\n\r\nLet\u2019s support this woman who has a lot of courage and strength in life.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>More about Tajikistan and IMON International<\/b>\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

","en":"Rosa is 45 years old and lives with her partner, Juan, age 47. The couple has 2 children, but they live with only one, Mirco, age 23, in a house that they own. For the past 25 years, Rosa has cultivated carrots, Peruvian potatoes, peas and gladiolus flowers of various colors, on land that she purchased with the help of her husband and her brothers Jes\u00fas and Rubino, who currently still cultivate the fields along with her. Although many years have passed, they remain united. Rosa considers her work to be worthwhile, because the profits from it have allowed her to build her house and provide an adequate standard of living for her family. Among her plans for the future, she is thinking about opening a fertilizer store in the community where she lives, since her neighbors buy a lot of these supplies. She would also like to buy and sell heavy machinery. This is her ninth loan with MFP, and she would like to continue working with the members of her communal bank, because they are very trustworthy and responsible people. She will invest the funds from this loan in purchasing pea seeds and several sacks of organic compost and fertilizers for her cultivated fields. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Patricia Linderman, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":465774,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Purchasing seeds, organic compost and fertilizers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-01-08T04:50:12Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":700,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-12-30T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-29T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-29T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-29T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":700}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":700,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2010-08-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:39:25Z","rounded_local_amount":2007.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166886649}],"funded_date":"2010-01-09T13:56:30Z","paid_date":"2010-09-15T10:39:25Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Patricia Linderman","image":100107}},{"id":171273,"name":"Kit","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Kit R. lives in a medium-sized house from which she operates a small enterprise, selling different types of groceries to the neighbors.

He is a hard-working man who has fought to provide for his family and educate his children, who today are working adults thanks to his example. \r\n\r\nBozor has been running the business of raising and selling cattle. He has 27 years of experience in this field. Since cattle raising and selling is a profitable business, Bozor has become a very successful businessman in a very short period. He works very hard and spends all his time with his animals, cleaning them, feeding and pasturing. \r\n\r\nNow Bozor wants to expand his business and buy more cattle. So he applied for a loan of $2500 USD. Bozor thanks all lenders for their support.  \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

San Jos\u00e9 group is named this way because all of the women who make up the group are very devoted to the Virgin of Guadalupe.  Also, they all live in San Jos\u00e9 del Progreso.  San Jos\u00e9 del Progresso is named in honor of the father of Jesus Christ.  The name Progreso was added later because in the past there existed a great period of economic growth in the municipality because of the abundant agricultural production in the region. \r\n\r\nThis town is in the VilL. D. Tutuepec D. Melchor Ocampo municipality (in the state of Oaxaca).  The town\u2019s principal economic activities are farming and raising livestock.  This is the first group that the Fundaci\u00f3n formed in this area.  It is comprised of 11 women with different business activities.\r\n\r\nEsteL. E. M., age 32, is the representative of the group.  She attended school until high school.  She is in a common-law marriage with Gerardo Sanabia M., an excavations operator.  They have four children.  Tania is 13, EsteL. is 10, Gerardo is 8, and Luis is 3.  Tania attends high school, and EsteL. and Gerardo are in elementary school.\r\n\r\nEsteL. requested the loan to buy footwear and to buy supplies to make and sell tamales.  In the morning she works selling shoes by catalogs.  In the afternoon she sells tamales.  EsteL. says that her businesses have gone very well for her.  She has various customers.  She sells her products door to door.\r\n\r\nPaulina Gazga L\u00f3pez is a member of the group.  She is 59 years old and lives in a common-law marriage with Sebastian H. Zaguilan, a farmer.  They have nine children; all of them are married.  They only have one granddaughter under their care.  \r\n\r\nPaulina is a farmer, and she grows lemons, papayas, \u201cchio zapote\u201d (an exotic tropical fruit), corn, and beans, among others.  She says that she sells lemons the most because there is a factory in the area that processes these products to make different lemon derivatives.  That is why she has sales all year round; she sells her harvest to the factory owners. She requested the loan to buy liquid to fumigate her land and to buy water to irrigate her crops.  \r\n\r\nShe is a very hard-working woman.  She and her husband grow different crops to sell.  She dreams of increasing her crops and that her crops are free from pests because this business activity feeds her family.  The earnings from her business are to support her family, especially her granddaughter.  Her granddaughter has been under her care since she was a newborn. \r\n\r\nShe is happy to belong to the Fundaci\u00f3n and that they have granted the loan.  She is grateful for the trust that they have shown in the members.\r\n\r\nThe following are the women who make up this group:\r\n\r\nPaulina G.

They live in their own home located in the Pichari district.  For a number of years, Ana has been selling groceries.  In her neighborhood there was no grocery store, so without thinking about it twice she decided to start up her own store.  Ever since, she has been getting better earnings each year.  Usually her best selling hours are from 5am until 8am, since during this time she receives a large quantity of customers; during these hours her children help her to attend to her customers quickly.  Normally the products that she sells are staples for the home, and because of this she feels content and satisfied with the work that she is doing.  She makes her sales from the first floor of her own house, at a reasonable price.  In the future, she plans to stock her store with a greater number of products with the goal of increasing her income, so that she can provide for her family's well-being.

Mayra sells pork, beverages, and sliced plantains.  She has been developing this business since she was 13, when she had to help her parents because they were very poor and the entire family worked.  This is why she couldn't have an education.  Three years ago, she decided to start her own business so she could contribute a little more income to her parents.  When she started her own family, she started to sell her food on buses until she could obtain a stand on the street where she sells her beverages, pork, and sliced plantains.  Her biggest dream is to raise her children in the best way possible, offering them good nutrition and the education she never received.  A solid business would let her give her children the material things that they need.  She already gives them love.  Mayra needs financing so she can buy merchandise for her business so she can keep working and accomplish all of her goals and dreams.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Tanya Harper, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":330781,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Working capital","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Leon","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.435556 -86.879444","type":"point"}},"partner_id":96,"posted_date":"2009-06-08T01:10:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":475,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mayra ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-05-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":9000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-29T07:00:00Z","amount":900},{"due_date":"2009-07-29T07:00:00Z","amount":900},{"due_date":"2009-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":900},{"due_date":"2009-09-29T07:00:00Z","amount":900},{"due_date":"2009-10-29T07:00:00Z","amount":900},{"due_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":900},{"due_date":"2009-12-29T08:00:00Z","amount":900},{"due_date":"2010-01-29T08:00:00Z","amount":900},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":900},{"due_date":"2010-03-29T07:00:00Z","amount":900}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.5},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.5},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.5},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.5},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.5},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.5},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.5},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.5},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.5},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":49.48,"local_amount":937.56,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T20:42:11Z","rounded_local_amount":946.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52956998},{"amount":45.52,"local_amount":862.44,"processed_date":"2009-07-29T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-05T09:31:32Z","rounded_local_amount":870.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":66055700},{"amount":47.5,"local_amount":900,"processed_date":"2009-08-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T15:31:44Z","rounded_local_amount":908.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73599907},{"amount":47.5,"local_amount":900,"processed_date":"2009-09-29T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T17:58:55Z","rounded_local_amount":908.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87035796},{"amount":49.23,"local_amount":932.76,"processed_date":"2009-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T21:42:02Z","rounded_local_amount":941.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96948194},{"amount":47.93,"local_amount":908.17,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T12:33:01Z","rounded_local_amount":916.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103790129},{"amount":47.65,"local_amount":902.84,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T13:33:58Z","rounded_local_amount":911.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110680801},{"amount":47.84,"local_amount":906.48,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:35:12Z","rounded_local_amount":914.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118075343},{"amount":44.85,"local_amount":849.75,"processed_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:08:09Z","rounded_local_amount":857.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123911397},{"amount":47.5,"local_amount":900,"processed_date":"2010-03-29T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-06T07:51:11Z","rounded_local_amount":908.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128947246}],"funded_date":"2009-06-08T02:58:10Z","paid_date":"2010-05-06T07:51:11Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tanya Harper","image":783083}},{"id":117727,"name":"Yolanda","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Yolanda D. is from the village of Lantungan, Aurora, Zamboanga del Sur.

For the past 10 years, she has dedicated herself to the sale of women's clothing in the market. The credits obtained through IMON International in the past helped her purchase more merchandise and augment her sales, which, in turn, created better revenue. Her friends admire her greatly, given that she is a dedicated mother and wife, in addition to being good at sales. Today, Shafoat seeks a new loan to be able to buy a lot of merchandise that her suppliers offered her at a good price; she wishes to take advantage of this opportunity. In this way, she can offer her wares at competitive prices without affecting her returns. \r\n\r\n<b>More about Tajikistan and IMON International<\/b><br>\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history and diverse culture, which is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet influence, New West culture, and Central Asian traditions. It served as a key post along the Silk Road and marked the end of Alexander the Great's extensive rule. It was the birthplace of the great Persian poet Rudaki and famous Islamic philosopher Ibn Sina. And it is home to epic mountain passes, communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON\u2019s History<\/b><br>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

With the help of a loan, some can pay school fees for their children; others use the loan to buy pieces of furniture, a plot of land or house-building materials; or invest in business. At the end of each month, these teachers repay their loan out of their monthly salaries.

Before that, her family faced many financial problems as she lived in the rural area and relied mainly on farming. After joining the Fund, she borrowed loans to invest in rearing pigs. After a period of time raising livestock and getting used to doing business, she and her husband decided to obtain more loans to buy rice and resell to retailers. She also milled the rice to sell to villagers. Currently, her family's monthly income from rearing pigs is about 3,000,000VND (about 187.50USD). Now, her family also buys peanuts and resells to retailers in town. Therefore, she would like to borrow 9,000,000VND (550USD) to purchase more rice and peanuts in the next season.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Vietnamese by Yen Thanh Pham, Kiva

However, he doesn\u2019t want to stop where he is with his venture. Hastiali is seeking a loan of $ 600 USD to increase the merchandise in his store.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Florenda is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase raw materials to make additional furniture. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Florenda from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 29 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1225,"image":{"id":579858,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Furniture

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.
