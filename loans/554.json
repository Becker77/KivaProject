She lives in her own house with her husband, Eleuterio, 53, and her 17-year-old son, Rub\u00e9n.  Her greatest wish is that her family have a happy life.  Her business is located in a highly commercial area of her city and she is convinced that the variety of her products increase her sales so she makes a special effort to keep her designs unique in the clothing she weaves.  What she most likes about her work is the weaving itself; she enjoys doing it very much and her state of mind is reflected in the finishes she gives her work.  She has had this occupation for 10 years.  The most difficult part of the work is transporting the finished items to her sales stall because the bundles are very heavy.  For further into the future, she would like to establish a large store from which to sell woven handicrafts and where she can sell her clothing items more peacefully.  This is Evangelina's second loan with MFP and she has discovered the value inherent in working in a group.  She is confident that she will repay her loan on time and not cause her communal bank any problems where she is very well-liked for the joy she expresses.  With the two-thousand soles requested she will buy more wool to increase the number of woven items she produces.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":429785,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Weaving","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"To buy wool.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Juliaca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15.5 -70.133333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-11-18T18:40:15Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":300,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Evangelina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-10-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":800,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2010-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2010-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2010-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2010-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2010-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2010-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":100}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2009-11-26T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:56:16Z","rounded_local_amount":107.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103843206},{"amount":75,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-25T09:54:42Z","rounded_local_amount":215.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734797},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2010-02-24T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:49:17Z","rounded_local_amount":107.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123959861},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2010-03-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:33:13Z","rounded_local_amount":107.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128992706},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2010-04-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:37:56Z","rounded_local_amount":107.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136717490},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2010-05-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:39:41Z","rounded_local_amount":107.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144751210},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2010-06-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:02:50Z","rounded_local_amount":107.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151933766}],"funded_date":"2009-11-18T19:41:12Z","paid_date":"2010-07-15T10:02:50Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":158533,"name":"Gloria","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Gloria D. is from the village of Estrella, San Guillermo, Isabela.

She runs her business out of her home, and works primarily on public relations in the Caribbean. On occasion, Felicia also writes for a daily newspaper in New York.\r\n\r\nThe turning point in her business was being contacted by an India-based company to do their ad placements in the Caribbean, Africa, and Latin America. She has successfully serviced their account for several years. In addition, she has recently been inundated with all the newswire hits on Haiti.\r\n\r\nFelicia contacted ACCION USA to provide her with the funds needed to hire a new staff member. She hit some struggles with her business during the economic downturn in 2008, but since then she has been doing her best to build her business. Her current staff of part- and full-time employees needs to be expanded to continue to successfully grow her business.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b> About U.S. Microfinance and ACCION USA:<\/b>\r\nHave you ever thought about how the cute new caf\u00e9 on your corner or the salon you frequent every month got the financial resources to start their business? Chances are, they drummed up support from their friends and family, dipped into their personal savings, used a high-interest credit card, or all of the above. An estimated ten million small businesses in the U.S. face difficulty obtaining loans from traditional banks, even prior to the current \u201ccredit crisis\u201d. Microfinance institutions, like ACCION USA, support these \u201cunbanked\u201d small businesses by giving them access to fairly-priced capital and business education.\r\n\r\nSmall businesses also help stabilize low- to moderate-income neighborhoods and rebuild our economy through income growth and job creation. Self-employment provides workers with a way to increase their incomes, support their families, and strengthen their communities. As unemployment rises in the U.S., more and more people are turning to self-employment and start-up enterprises as a way to take control of their economic futures and provide employment opportunities in their communities. The need for support of small businesses in the U.S. is great, and it is one that ACCION USA has been striving to meet since

Her husband works as a builder. They have a daughter and a son. The daughter is fifteen; she studies at school in the 8th class and the son works as a handyman in a store. The son and the husband also breed cattle to make money. With money received from the loan, Baktygul wants to purchase three farm animals for breeding. In the future she plans to increase the number of livestock and improve their living conditions.\r\n\r\nShaiyrkul S. is the treasurer of the group. She is 55 and a widow. She has raised a daughter and two sons. The daughter is married, the older son went to Russia to make some money, and the younger son helps his mom around the farm. Shaiyrkul has been breeding cattle for 20 years, if she needs money she can sell some cattle. With money received from the loan, she wants to purchase one farm animal in order to increase the number of livestock.\r\n\r\nShapanbubu I. is 57 and her husband is a pensioner. They have three sons and six daughters. The older children are married and live separately with their families. The younger son and the younger daughter study at school.  Shapanbubu and her husband have been farming for 16 years, since 1994. Now she applied for the loan because she needs money to pay for tractor service, to purchase 50 litters of fuel, which is needed for the sowing process, and buy some cattle for breeding. \r\n\r\nTurumkan K. is 58 and married. She has four sons and two daughters. All the children are married and live separately with their families. Three years ago Turumkan and her husband sold cattle for 15000 soms ($326.58), and with that amount they started to breed cattle and sell them later on. In this way they make 6000 soms ($130.63) per month.

Caritina is going to buy ruled notebooks, notecards, protractor sets and other items to stock her stationery store.  Veronica is going to buy nopal pads to plant, grow and sell.\r\n\r\nCarolina is 27 years old.

She requests this loan to buy insecticide for her crops.  She started this business 10 years ago because her husband taught her how to grow nopal.  Her business is important because with the sales of her nopal products she helps to cover the household expenses.  She likes selling nopal because she has the income to repay the loan and some unexpected expenses, and she uses the profits in part for her family, and also to buy fertilizer and to rent a rotavator to turn over the land and extract the remains of the plants once the nopals have been harvested.  Her business is popular because the plant is used as a food and also for medicinal purposes.\r\n\r\nIn Tlalnepantla there are many nopal producers; they transport their products to sell in different cities, or they sell to the distributors in Mexico City.

She sells fried dough and sausages and eggs. Her present working capital amounts to about US$ 200. <P>\r\n\r\nWivine has her sales point in a neighborhood in the center of Kinshasa where she has lots of customers. She began by selling chickens in 1989. Her intital capital was US$ 40. From 1990 to 1993, with the profits she had accumulated from her business,  Wivine diversified and added the sale of sausages which she bought wholesale and delivered to grocery stores. This brought her working capital up to US$ 1,000. <P>\r\n\r\nIn 1993, Wivine fell victim to the pillaging in Kinshasa and lost all her merchandise. She was left without merchandise and without funds. Thus, from 1994 to 2004, she tried selling cases of soap without success. In 2003 she was caught off balance at the death of her husband.  She changed her business in 2005 to begin selling spices which brought her to a significant capital of US$ 2,400--which sadly was stolen by robbers. <P>\r\n\r\nAround the end of that same year, Wivine took up selling fried dough again with the insignificant working capital of $20, a business she has continued until this day. Her business is growing rapidly and producing a profit of US$ 30 per week. The loan that she has received has allowed her to buy 1 sack of wheat flour, 1 jerrycan of 25 liters of refined vegetable oil, sugar, and other ingredients for making fried dough in order to grow her profit. Her dream is to open up a drinks depot so as to be able to supply retailers. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Teresa Kramer, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3250,"image":{"id":301632,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Catering","sector":"Food","themes":["Conflict Zones"],"use":"purchasing one sack of wheat flour, 1 jerrycan of 25 liters of vegetable oil, and some sugar","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CD","country":"Congo (Dem.

Mollejones is a town located 150 kilometers south of San Jos\u00e9 Province, the capital of Costa Rica. It is 850 meters above sea level. Vegetables and coffee are farmed there and people also engage in other economic activities such as fattening cattle and hogs. There are also some organic agriculture projects, such as hydroponic vegetables. In addition to agriculture, the community has mechanic shops, a supermarket, small restaurants, and a furniture workshop. \r\n\r\nGuillermo has been working as a carpenter for a little more than two years. He makes furniture in a variety of styles and for different uses. He says that since he started this business, things have gone well for him. The business has been well accepted in his community and the income it has generated has helped him to support his family.\r\n\r\nAt this time Guillermo is requesting a loan of 685,000 CRC to buy more wood and other materials that he needs to make the furniture. With this, he hopes that his small business will grow and that it will generate enough income for him to improve his living conditions. \r\n\r\nGuillermo is part of the Empresa de Cr\u00e9dito Comunal de Bancruce, one of the 100 partner organizations of EDESA in Costa Rica. As a member, he has received a small loan that has allowed him to grow like other small business owners.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jennifer Day, Kiva

Rice (bhat), lentils (daal), and vegetables (thakari) are the staples of the Nepali diet.\r\n\r\nWith a Kiva loan, Patan BPW's borrowers are able to purchase greater amounts of seed and fertilizer, which enables them to grow cash crops to sell in the local market. Such crops allow households to move beyond subsistence and provide much-needed cash income throughout the year.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>About Patan BPW:<\/b>\r\nThis loan was administered by Kiva's local partner in Nepal: micro-finance institution, Patan Business and Professional Women. Patan BPW became Kiva's first field partner in Nepal in 2007. It operates throughout the Kathmandu Valley, offering microcredit and business training programs to low-income women.\r\n\r\nIn addition to providing economic opportunity to its clients, Patan BPW seeks to empower Nepali women within the home and community.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":150,"image":{"id":587473,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To

They have four young children who they are bringing up and educating in their own home which is located in the rural area of Santa Clara. When he was just a boy, his parents taught him how to work the earth. This meant that when he started his own family he already had experience growing potatoes. As he is a responsible father, each harvest time he takes his crops to the central market of the country's capital and sells it there where he can get a good price and make a profit. What he likes about his work is sowing the crops and seeing how the seed grows little by little.

Mar\u00eda has been a FEMA client for three cycles and she\u2019s made all her installment payments on time.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1175,"image":{"id":809937,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy stock items for her store.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"La Union, Olancho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15 -86.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":168,"posted_date":"2011-07-22T19:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1175,"lender_count":27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Magdalena ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Fidelina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Santos Alberto","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Santos Antonio ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-06-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":22000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":1175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":2750},{"due_date":"2011-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":2750},{"due_date":"2011-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":2750},{"due_date":"2011-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":2750},{"due_date":"2011-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":2750},{"due_date":"2012-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":2750},{"due_date":"2012-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":2750},{"due_date":"2012-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":2750}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":146.88},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":146.87},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":146.88},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":146.87},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":146.88},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":146.87},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":146.88},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":146.87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":146.88,"local_amount":2750,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-17T07:57:56Z","rounded_local_amount":2775.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227307943},{"amount":106.39,"local_amount":1991.98,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T08:51:50Z","rounded_local_amount":2010.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232784929},{"amount":187.69,"local_amount":3514.19,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T09:53:42Z","rounded_local_amount":3546.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238589324},{"amount":734.04,"local_amount":13743.83,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-16T08:50:29Z","rounded_local_amount":13869.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244547418}],"funded_date":"2011-07-31T02:58:36Z","paid_date":"2011-12-16T08:50:29Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":323101,"name":"Jos\u00e9 Ram\u00f3n","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Jos\u00e9 es un hombra de 43 a\u00f1os y est\u00e1 casado, vive con su esposa Ana de 34 a\u00f1os y sus dos hijos, de 13 y 15 a\u00f1os.

The official name of this borrowing group is 'Rosario R. Group'.\r\n\r\nRosario is married and has 3 school-aged children. To make a living, Rosario owns & operates a business venture in the agriculture sector, raising livestock. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from raising pigs for fattening and sale. Rosario has been engaged in her business for over 7 years and earns approximately 2,500 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Rosario joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Rosario is requesting a loan of 5000 PHP which will be used to purchase baby livestock to raise & sell in future. This will be the first loan taken out by Rosario from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay the tuition fees of her children. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines.

Por ello,  Eusebio tuvo que dejar la tierra que lo vio nacer y todo lo que pose\u00eda, para proteger  su vida  y la vida de su familia.

They live in their own home, located in the Pichari district.  Eusebio is a person who has experienced hardship and suffering, resulting from the excesses of political violence that occurred during the decades of the 80s and 90s.  Because of this, Eusebio had to leave his homeland and everything he owned in order to protect his life and the lives of his family.  Eusebio's father was a master builder of mud and straw, and so Eusebio learned this trade from his father and devoted himself to building houses made of mud and straw.  Later Eusebio noted that when people began to have better incomes and the socioeconomic problems were getting resolved, more people were opting to have homes built of more solid materials.  For this reason, Eusebio decided to get trained in construction and building in CAPECO, where he obtained a master builder certificate.  Now, Eusebio builds impressive homes, works of art on the streets of Pichari.  Eusebio is happy with his work, and has the support of his workers.  This is his first loan with MFP, and he is committed to making his payments on time.  With the 2,000 Peruvian soles Eusebio requests, he will buy some tools that he currently lacks.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":827723,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Construction Supplies","sector":"Construction","themes":null,"use":"to buy construction tools","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"CUSCO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.518333 -71.978056","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-08-06T17:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":750,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Eusebio ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-07-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":132.94},{"due_date":"2011-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":142.42},{"due_date":"2011-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":147.44},{"due_date":"2011-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":150.76},{"due_date":"2011-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":157.97},{"due_date":"2012-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":162.03},{"due_date":"2012-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":167.94},{"due_date":"2012-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":176.31},{"due_date":"2012-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":180.51},{"due_date":"2012-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":187.79},{"due_date":"2012-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":193.95},{"due_date":"2012-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":199.94}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.85},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.41},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.29},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.54},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.23},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.77},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.97},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.12},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.69},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.42},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.73},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.98}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":750,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-17T08:13:51Z","rounded_local_amount":2053.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227350825}],"funded_date":"2011-08-08T02:26:34Z","paid_date":"2011-09-17T08:13:51Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lisa Grobar","image":264298}},{"id":327218,"name":"Elmer","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Elmer is 46 years old and lives in the Philippines.

She will utilize the loan for additional spare parts and the maintenance of her tricycle. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nElizabeth hopes to be able to have another tricycle. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies. \r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay micro-finance

She is a very kind person, hardworking and enthusiastic, who puts all her efforts into raising her child, as she is his mother for him. Unfortunately Luz was not able to finish her primary school studies, since from a very young child she had to work to help her parents. Her family is humble, but she would have liked very much to study for a professional career in education. In her free time she likes to visit her family and sometimes on these occasions to cook delicious fried fish to share with them.\r\n\r\nOn her own initiative, with a lot of effort and dedication, Luz works in her own small business selling fish. She works every day from early in the morning and can work for approximately 7 hours. She feels happy doing her work and believes that it is going well because of her good prices and the kind service she offers her customers.\r\n\r\nLuz is very grateful for the Kiva loans as thanks to the support given she she can buy construction materials, such as wood, corrugated zinc roofing, and nails. This will allow Luz to finish the construction of the roof of her house, as she is hoping to be able to offer better security and wellbeing for her family. So Luz will continue working and striving to achieve her big dream of being able to give a good education to her child and in the not so far off future see him become a good professional.\r\n"}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1241668,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish Selling","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy construction materials such as wood, corrugated zinc roofing and nails, in order to complete the construction of the roof of her house.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":139,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Luz Perla ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-10-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":800,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":77.5},{"due_date":"2013-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":90.59},{"due_date":"2013-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":94.38},{"due_date":"2013-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":100.53},{"due_date":"2013-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":102.52},{"due_date":"2013-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":107.26},{"due_date":"2013-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":111.28},{"due_date":"2013-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":115.94}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.48},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.81},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.34},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.84},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.65},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.57},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.21},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.1}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Gail LeGrand","image":190313}},{"id":598104,"name":"Angie","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Angie ha trabajado en el comercio desde hace 10 a\u00f1os, siguiendo los pasos de Lina Sequeira, clienta de Fundaci\u00f3n Mujer, quien la recomienda.

To make a living, she owns and operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising livestock. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from raising pigs for fattening and sale. Joanne has been engaged in her business for over eight years and earns approximately 3,000 PHP whenever she sells an animal she has raised. Joanne said that it is difficult to have four very young children but she is doing her best to meet their needs. Joanne's family lives in the village of Alibago, Enrile, Cagayan. \r\n\r\nIn 2009, Joanne joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 7,000 PHP from ASKI. Joanne is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP which will be used to purchase livestock feed and other supplies. This will be the third loan she has taken out from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to make improvements to her house. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 29 branches covering the central and north-eastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

His father grew vegetables and so he decided to help him grow his crops and learned the trade perfectly.\r\n\r\nJuan started his own business with his father's help.  He has been working for five years for his own family.  His advantage is that the land where he grows his crop is good land.

She is married and has 4 school-aged children. To make a living, Sharel owns and operates a business venture in the retail sector: she runs a general store. Although it is not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling daily use products such as shampoo, soap, and toothpaste in the local community. Sharel has been engaged in this business for over 2 years and earns approximately 750 Samoa talas (WST) a month (approximately $350 USD) from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2011, Sharel joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and for the ability to engage in business activities. Sharel is requesting her first loan of 1000 WST from SPBD, which will be used to purchase additional goods to sell. Sharel plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her

These small, black and dirty pieces of dry earth are important not just to Parmo but to her customers who rely on charcoal to cook their meals. Many Tanzanians still use small coal pots, in which they arrange mkaa (charcoal) and add either paper, dry grass, old plastic bags, or kerosene in order to light them. The fire requires constant fanning to ignite and maintain the flame and makes cooking quite a hot and laborious task. It may not be the easiest or most environmentally friendly form of cooking, but it is the only option many people can afford. Which is good news for Parmo, who requires a loan of $275 in order to add to her stock of mkaa and continue meeting the customer demand.<p>SELFINA is engaged in economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through a leasing and leaseback facility as a practical way to achieve economic and social emancipation of women.<p>SELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro Leasing. Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed not credit worthy by financial institutions as they lack tangible collateral assets. This leads to poor financial support, hence poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.<p>SELFINA buys and leases equipment to women.

Thi Nguyen, 58 years old, joined the Fund in 2001.  Her family\u2019s situation is very unfortunate; her husband passed away, leaving her to raise their one child by herself.  The child is now grown and live at home with Mrs. Nguyen.  When she first joined the Fund, the family invested in livestock.  In every round of funding the family used the money successfully and brought in a large income.  Currently she is investing the funding in general store run out of her home, and it is truly a business venture that brings strong results with high incomes.  In her town, there are very few people running general stores, so the majority of the townspeople buy goods from her family\u2019s store.  Although her family situation was in a very desperate state, thanks to her perseverance the family\u2019s finances are now very much improved.  In this round of funding she is requesting 18,000,000 VND to continue investing in the general store.  Their average income is 5,000,000 VND per month.  \r\n<p><b>Translated from Vietnamese by Chi Nguyen, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\nCh\u1ecb Nguy\u1ec5n Th\u1ecb Li\u00ean 58 tu\u1ed5i, tham gia Qu\u1ef9 n\u0103m 2001 ho\u00e0n c\u1ea3nh gia \u0111\u00ecnh ch\u1ecb v\u1ea5t v\u1ea3, ch\u1ed3ng m\u1ea5t s\u1edbm m\u1ed9t m\u00ecnh ch\u1ecb v\u1ea5t v\u1ea3 nu\u00f4i 1 con hi\u1ec7n nay con ch\u1ecb \u0111\u00e3 tr\u01b0\u1edfng th\u00e0nh v\u00e0 ch\u1ecb \u0111ang s\u1ed1ng c\u00f9ng con, khi tham gia v\u00e0o Qu\u1ef9 ch\u1ecb vay v\u1ed1n c\u0169ng \u0111\u1ea7u t\u01b0 v\u00e0o ch\u0103n nu\u00f4i, qua c\u00e1c v\u00f2ng v\u1ed1n gia \u0111\u00ecnh ch\u1ecb \u0111\u1ec1u s\u1eed d\u1ee5ng c\u00f3 hi\u1ec7u qu\u1ea3 v\u00e0 cho thu nh\u1eadp cao.

Vilma has already finished high school and when she found herself in need of work, she started her own business selling clothing at wholesale and retail prices from her home.  Vilma travels to the western part of the country to purchase merchandise because it is much cheaper there. This way she will be able to offer her customers better prices.  \r\n\r\nVilma\u2019s dream is to open a small store where she can hire someone to help her with her business so she can continue her studies at the university, but, as of now, it is merely a dream because she would need to save a lot of money in order to make such an investment.  For this reason Vilma is applying for a loan to purchase more merchandise and obtain greater profits which will help her achieve her dream of expanding her business and continuing her studies.<br

It has produced famous thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. A civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged an already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

They are on their 5th solidarity loan, after having correctly reimbursed the preceding loans. This new loan will be used to buy 4 bolts of high-quality \"bazin\" (a sort of damask) which will be dyed before being sold, 150 pairs of shoes, 10 dozen perfumes and raw materials for making incense  (5kg of \"magnonkiss\u00e8ni\" and 5kg of \"n\u2019gu\u00e9ni\"--seeds of wild exotic plants--and a case of perfumes). To have good quality incense you soak the \"magnonkiss\u00e8ni\" or the \"n\u2019gu\u00e9ni\" in eau de Cologne for a month or more before using other sorts of perfumes to embellish it. They buy all the raw materials in S\u00e9gou in the big open-air market and sell their wares for cash and retail or for credit out of their homes and walking through the neighborhoods and the big marketplace, to a clientele composed of men and women. <P>\r\n\r\n They expect to make a monthly average profit of 39,000 F CFA which will be used to help their husbands support their families.

He has over ten years of experience as a salesman and two years ago opened his own business. His storefront business sells CDs, records, clothing, and gifts. Gaudencio\u2019s wife and one of his sisters help him run the store. His business attracts the growing Latino population in his community.\r\n\r\nOne of Gaudencio\u2019s greatest challenges is that he doesn\u2019t always have the goods that his customers are looking for. With his second ACCION USA loan, Gaudencio will be able to diversify his inventory by purchasing more clothing and Mexican accessories. This will allow him to retain more customers who come into his store looking for specific items. \r\n\r\nGaudencio has enjoyed being his own boss and generating extra income for his family. He felt the hardships of the economic crisis when no bank would lend to him. Receiving a loan from ACCION USA has allowed him to maintain his business and support his family. Gaudencio hopes to continue growing his business so that his family will be well off some day.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout U.S. Microfinance and ACCION USA\r\n\r\nHave you ever thought about how the cute new caf\u00e9 on your corner or the salon you frequent every month got the financial resources to start their business? Chances are, they drummed up support from their friends and family, dipped into their personal savings, used a high-interest credit card, or all of the above. An estimated ten million small businesses in the U.S. face difficulty obtaining loans from traditional banks, even prior to the current \u201ccredit crisis\u201d. Microfinance institutions, like ACCION USA, support these \u201cunbanked\u201d small businesses by giving them access to fairly-priced capital and business education.\r\n\r\nSmall businesses also help stabilize low- to moderate-income neighborhoods and rebuild the economy through income growth and job creation. Self-employment provides workers with a way to increase their incomes, support their families, and strengthen their communities. As unemployment rises in the U.S., more and more people are turning to self-employment and start-up enterprises as a way to take control of their economic futures and provide employment opportunities in their communities. The need for support of small businesses in the U.S. is great, and it is one that ACCION USA has been striving to meet since 1991.

Mrs Irma, in order to help her children in school, sells her chickens and turkeys. She gives her earnings to her children so that they can keep studying--so this loan will benefit her family. Mrs Irma has a lot of experience and says that she does not find it difficult to raise the animals, but that it would be difficult to raise other animals such as cows, because she would have to let them out to eat and stay out all day.\r\n\r\nMrs Irma's dream is for her family to be in good health and for her business to advance, and to be able to sell all of her animals, and for her children to finish studying what they want to study.

She is a resident of Caloocan City, Philippines. She, together with her husband and children, manage their household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.  \r\n\r\nRose operates a food stall. In the Philippines, the whole working community and most of the families eat home-cooked meals during the evening when all  family members are at home to take part in the meal. This is not only a usual family tradition but a matter of convenience and frugal living. It is considered a waste of money to spend cooking gas and food for one to two persons when buying cooked rice and viands cost less than raw food. Rose's regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of 400 PHP a day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, Rose is requesting a loan for 16,000 PHP. She will use the loan to buy more quantities of products such as meats, rice, vegetables, condiments, seasonings, and frozen food products. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nRose dreams of giving her her children a high quality education through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study God, build social capital, and pay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":980911,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

Her husband left the family to go down south, making her life (which is already hard) become even harder.  H.\u2019s main job is to make rice pancake.  She wakes up to work from 3 a.m. everyday.  She finishes making the rice pancake at 5.am., then spends her whole morning to deliver the pancakes to the restaurants.  Because her pancakes are good, she often finishes selling everything before noon.  Each pancake brings her a profit of $0.012.  On average, Ms. H. earns $3.5 a day.  This amount is mostly spent for the food and the school bills.  Now Ms. H. is looking forward to borrow $125 to buy more rice and sesame \u2013 the ingredients for her rice pancakes- to increase the amount of pancakes sold everyday during the summer.\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Vietnamese by PH.

The civil war, which took place soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., severely damaged the already-weak economic infrastructure and caused a sharp decline in agricultural production and the manufacturing sector.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  All of these factors have resulted in a severe lack of jobs and have forced hundreds of thousands to leave Tajikistan to find work in other countries, mostly in Russia.  While Tajikistan has experienced some economic growth since the end of the Civil War, nearly two-thirds of the population still lives in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON International's mission is to promote sustainable economic development and improved quality of life in Tajikistan by insuring reliable access to financial services for the economically active members of the population. IMON has eight branch offices throughout Tajikistan and their entrepreneurs work in many parts of the country's economic sector including trade, manufacturing, agriculture, and services. As of October 2008, IMON had 27,802 active clients and a total portfolio of $28,405,549.  Approximately 44% of these clients are women and 65% are from rural areas.

Unfortunately, her undergarments sales did not go as expected; so for this new loan she has decided to try a new business.

She has a partner, and lives with her 26-year old daughter and 1-year old grandson. All the adults in the family work; Elida has a butcher's shop that sells poultry. \r\n\r\nShe began the business on her own and doesn't hold daily hours of operation because she has her own chicken farm. Every 6 weeks she has chickens ready for sale. Elida has realized she needs a loan to buy more chickens and chicken feed. She also has a business selling clothing and will invest in the purchase of more clothes.\r\n\r\nThis loan will provide her with the products necessary to meet her customers' demands, so that she can earn more income and improve her family's living standards. Elida hopes to expand her business to become a wholesale poultry distributor.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Vivian Lu, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":580074,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Purchase or chickens, chicken feed, and clothing.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Santa Elena, Usulutan","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":167,"posted_date":"2010-08-08T12:50:01Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":500,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elida Del Carmen ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-08-04T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":34.52},{"due_date":"2010-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":36.14},{"due_date":"2010-11-04T07:00:00Z","amount":36.83},{"due_date":"2010-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":38.45},{"due_date":"2011-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":39.29},{"due_date":"2011-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":40.58},{"due_date":"2011-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":42.78},{"due_date":"2011-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":43.31},{"due_date":"2011-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":44.92},{"due_date":"2011-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":46.19},{"due_date":"2011-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":47.81},{"due_date":"2011-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":49.18}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.52},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.14},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.83},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.45},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39.29},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.58},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.78},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.31},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.92},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.19},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.81},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.18}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":34.55,"local_amount":34.55,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:29:44Z","rounded_local_amount":34.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172162962},{"amount":37.28,"local_amount":37.28,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T15:26:07Z","rounded_local_amount":37.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177458843},{"amount":35.8,"local_amount":35.8,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:13:58Z","rounded_local_amount":35.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182596885},{"amount":39.43,"local_amount":39.43,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-19T10:12:01Z","rounded_local_amount":39.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":189181619},{"amount":352.94,"local_amount":352.94,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T04:55:19Z","rounded_local_amount":352.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191474454}],"funded_date":"2010-08-09T02:36:32Z","paid_date":"2011-02-16T04:55:19Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Vivian Lu","image":225936}}]}
