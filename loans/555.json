She has 5 children, who are all grown adults.  In 2002, Mrs. V. joined the Fund to have more capital to invest in raising livestock to improve the family's finances.  Currently, besides the income from the livestock and tree farming businesses, the family also has income streams from her husband's security job and her children's salaries.  The family's finances are becoming more and more stable with time.  With a total income of 2,500,000 VND per month, Mrs. V.'s repayments are proceeding very favorably.  In this round of funding she would like to borrow 10,000,000 VND to invest in buying more pigs to raise.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Vietnamese by Chi Nguyen, Kiva

He and his wife have three older children, ages 13,15 and 18, two of whom are attending high school and one who is at a university, which is very expensive; It is for this reason that he strives to get ahead in order to support his children so that they receive a good education and can be professionals in the future. His business is mattresses production. For 3 years he has been manufacturing soft mattresses. He began working in mattress production in a business, then saved, and with his severance decided to begin. This has benefited him until now, as he has increased his inventory, also thanks to Afodenic for the support that they have given him to improve his business. This is his fifth application, which he requests in order to invest in the purchase of four 100 pound strips of material to manufacture mattresses. He hopes to gain a lot of profit with the requests and sales. His goal for the future is to be able to grow and to offer his products to different provinces around the country.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Heather Nicholson, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":271829,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Manufacturing","sector":"Manufacturing","themes":null,"use":"Purchase four 100 pound strips of material for mattress production","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Managua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.150833 -86.268333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":98,"posted_date":"2009-03-02T22:50:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":650,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Candido Humberto","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-02-10T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":13000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1300},{"due_date":"2009-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1300},{"due_date":"2009-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1300},{"due_date":"2009-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1300},{"due_date":"2009-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1300},{"due_date":"2009-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1300},{"due_date":"2009-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1300},{"due_date":"2009-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1300},{"due_date":"2009-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":1300},{"due_date":"2009-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":1300}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":65},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":65.2,"local_amount":1303.96,"processed_date":"2009-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T09:12:15Z","rounded_local_amount":1313.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27039001},{"amount":65.09,"local_amount":1301.84,"processed_date":"2009-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T09:47:07Z","rounded_local_amount":1311.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35929294},{"amount":65.68,"local_amount":1313.59,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T20:24:09Z","rounded_local_amount":1323.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44384200},{"amount":67.58,"local_amount":1351.54,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T16:32:26Z","rounded_local_amount":1361.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52890658},{"amount":61.83,"local_amount":1236.63,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T09:38:20Z","rounded_local_amount":1246.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63111959},{"amount":68.05,"local_amount":1361.01,"processed_date":"2009-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T09:51:18Z","rounded_local_amount":1371.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73533365},{"amount":65.13,"local_amount":1302.52,"processed_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T10:03:32Z","rounded_local_amount":1312.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":86964739},{"amount":65.66,"local_amount":1313.18,"processed_date":"2009-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T10:49:51Z","rounded_local_amount":1323.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96875202},{"amount":125.78,"local_amount":2515.73,"processed_date":"2009-11-21T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T10:45:51Z","rounded_local_amount":2534.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103713159}],"funded_date":"2009-03-03T07:05:50Z","paid_date":"2009-12-15T10:45:51Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Heather Nicholson","image":null}},{"id":93263,"name":"Khiev","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Khiev Y., 41, is married and lives with five of her children in Kampong Cham province.

rather than money. Establishing a day-care business out of her home, she is most proud of the fact that children remain at her center for an average of 1-2 years, much longer than the 3-6 months they spend on average at other home-based centers. Christina is passionate about making it her life's work to be a positive influence in these children's lives.\r\n\r\nHaving taken out a number of loans with ACCION USA, Christina has been able to purchase supplies and toys that enable her to provide a richer educational experience for children than those of competing businesses. Christina will use her latest loan to purchase an outdoor playhouse and picnic table so that her children can take advantage of the warm weather in the summer months to play outside. She would like to take out future loans to purchase a computer that her kids can use to play educational games.\r\n\r\nChristina dreams of expanding her business from her home to a day-care center.

In a way, however, his business has remained active. This he principally attributes to the good working chord he has struck with his clientele.\r\n\r\nIn a week, Wilberforce says he makes more than 50,000 Ugandan shillings, a figure he admits will not substantively make his business see the light of day in the near future. He is therefore seeking a loan to lend countenance to his business.

","en":"The group \"Mujeres Trabajadoras\" (Hardworking Women) has been together for one year, and works with the Fundaci\u00f3n Paraguaya.  Most of its members are already engaged in productive activities, and they are all very satisfied with what they do. One of the women in the group is Marta F., who sells clothes. She comes from a very humble family and works hard to support her own family. Currently she needs to build another room on her house for her children, and that is why she is requesting a loan from the Foundation. Right now the income from her clothing sales isn't enough to cover the extra costs of improving the house. She is thankful for the help she receives from Kiva through Fundaci\u00f3n Paraguaya.\r\n\r\nAll the women of the group are women of scarce resources, but they dream of a better future for there children. For this reason, they work twice as hard to provide them with what they need to grow and develop.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Shaun Haines, Kiva

She successfully repaid a previous loan of 7000 PHP from ASKI which she used to purchase additional fruits and vegetables to sell. Adelina is requesting a new loan (her third from ASKI) of 8000 PHP which will be used to buy new produce to expand her offerings. She plans to use all additional revenue to financially support immediate members of her family. \r\n<p>\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n<p>\r\nAlalay sa Kaunlaran, Inc., or ASKI, is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the central and northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fishermen and -women, and small entrepreneurs.\r\n<p>\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that one-on-one translations of entrepreneur profiles are costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow it to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":595696,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To purchase new produce to expand her offerings","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Brgy.

Gradually she increase her sales and the business generated income which she used to purchase a refrigerator that can hold more bottles in order to respond to the increasing customer demand and generate more income.

He barely managed to complete his 6th grade education. He is the father of 2 children, the eldest one being 4 years old and in preschool and the other one being 4 months old. He is the head of the household, responsible for providing food daily for his family thanks to his hard work and industrious hands that plant corn and cassava every day. He learned this work from his father who taught him from an early age. With time he gained experience until on reaching the age of 20 he became independent and started planting by himself. Nowadays, he plants cassava and corn as they sell the most in his area and gives him a better income.

Meet Esther who is a 55-year-old sweet mother of four. She is very smiley, charismatic, and tender.\nEsther is a farmer from the remote village of Gicici, situated in the Central province of Kenya. The living conditions in this area are tough because there is neither clean water nor electrical connections. \n\nFor 10 years, her primary sources of income have been milk, eggs and horticultural produce. Esther\u2019s biggest challenges are disease and a shortage of farm inputs. Farmers in the area lack capital to purchase farm inputs such as chemicals to prevent these diseases. Esther made the decision to join Juhudi Kilimo in order to access loans that would help her improve her farming activities.

She has 7 children, 2 of whom are still dependent upon her, and they are an 11 year old son who recently completed 3rd grade of primary school and another son age 14 who finished 1st year of secondary school. Her goals are to expand her business so that it grows and in this way she remains active as this has been her greatest income lately. Her wishes are to open a business in a stable locale as she doesn\u2019t have the necessary conditions to open it. She has found it difficult to maintain 2 businesses, which are a bakery and selling clothing, which has been one of the greatest sources of income for her and her family.\r\n\r\nHer work involves the bakery and general merchandise, where she sells items such as pants, shirts, women\u2019s underwear and shirts. It is located in her home, and she has had this business for 4 years. Josefa began this business because her daughter was the one who showed her this business as her daughter used to live in Honduras and learned this work in that country.

For her children, Josie dreams of having them experience a comfortable life and finish their studies until college.\r\n\r\nWhen ASHI came to the municipality of Sibalom where Josie and her family live, she did not let the chance of a loan pass her by. She joined ASHI in 2008 and she availed her first loan then. She knew in her heart that her membership in ASHI was a step towards achieving her dream. Therefore, loans she received from then on were used to put up an initial business that generated her own income. This helped her husband who is a tricycle driver (motorcycle with a sidecar attached to it. Most common means of transportation of people all over town.)  \r\n\r\nNow Josie applied for another loan intended for her vision of having a backyard poultry (raising of chicken) and hog (pig) raising business. Chickens will be raised up to 45 days and will be sold thereafter while hogs will be raised up to four months and will be sold thereafter. Josie realized having this kind of business could maximize her time while she attends to her previous business, a variety store, and to her children. While at home, she believes she can make money that will change their

For the past year she has sold clothing and beauty products which she takes to her customers in her husband's motor vehicle.  Also, for the past 4 years, Rosa has had a small grocery store in her home where she sells food items and beverages;  her children help her tend to the customers at the store while she is out delivering her beauty products.  What she most likes about her job is the contact she has with people with whom she has pleasant conversations and makes many friendships.  Besides, it is profitable because she works for a very well-known cosmetics brand and her customers always require these products.  Her wish for the future is to convert her small store into a minimart.  This is her 8th loan with MFP.  She is a member of a communal bank and very accustomed to her fellow members, who she likes very much because they work well together and are very well organized.

Sohibnazar is 41 years old. He has a successful business selling flour at the local market in Kabodien region. Sohibnazar sells an assortment of good quality flours. In the picture you can see Sohibnazar with his guarantor of the loan. Because he buys the flour at wholesale, the price is cheaper than the price of his competitors. Thus, he has many customers who even make a purchase of his flour straight from his house. Today he has a great demand for his goods and that is why he wants to take an individual loan. Sohibnazar has requested a loan of 13,000 Somoni to add to his working capital and allow him to purchase more inventory. He is ready to work even harder, make sacrifices and push every once in a while to achieve his goal and become a successful entrepreneur. We believe his perseverance and clear vision will become key success factors in his small business. \n\n\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\n\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\nIMON's History\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Lurgia y su pareja son el sost\u00e9n de su familia. Desde muy ni\u00f1a sus padres le inculcaron a trabajar en la chacra, ella es campesina y cuenta con 03 hect\u00e1reas de terreno cultivados con plantas de caf\u00e9, cacao, achiote y hojas de coca; plantas oriundas de la zona selv\u00e1tica del Valle R\u00edo Apurimac. Viene trabajando 06 a\u00f1os en sus propias tierras, y en tiempos de cosecha cuenta con el apoyo de los jornaleros encargados en cosechar y desmontar la maleza. Lo que m\u00e1s le gusta de su trabajo es cosechar los frutos de las plantas; ya que as\u00ed siente que los meses de arduo trabajo le brindan como recompensa la calidad de sus frutos. Considera que lo m\u00e1s dif\u00edcil es transportar sus productos desde la chacra hasta los centros de acopio ubicados en la ciudad de san francisco; lugar donde le ofrecen mejores precios por sus productos. Su dificultad es no poder contar con la maquina despulpadora de caf\u00e9 que es de utilidad para descascarar los granos de caf\u00e9; es por ello que acude a la instituci\u00f3n MFP para concederle el pr\u00e9stamo. En adelante, desea incrementar sus sembrios con plantas de caf\u00e9 ya que cuenta con 02 hect\u00e1reas de terreno no cultivado. Este su octavo cr\u00e9dito con MFP, y espera poder pagarlo a tiempo, ya que no quiere causarles problemas a las compa\u00f1eras de su banco comunal, en donde es muy respetada debido al orden que impone al grupo. Con los 1,000 nuevos soles solicitados, comprar\u00e1 una  maquina despulpadora  para descarar los granos del caf\u00e9.\n\n","en":"Lurgia is 28 years old.  She is from Santa Rosa district and lives with her partner, 30 year-old Osorio.  They have three children and live in their own home which is located in Pampa Miraflores community, a small village in Santa Rosa district.  Lurgia and her partner support their family together.\r\n\r\nLurgia's parents taught her to work on the farm from a very young age.  She is a farmer and owns 3 hectares of land where she plants coffee, cacao, annatto and coca leaf.  These are all plants which are native to the rainforest area of the Apurimac River Valley.  Lurgia has been working her own land for 6 years and, during harvest time, she has the support of day laborers who harvest and weed her crops.  What Lurgia most enjoys about her work is harvesting the fruit from her plants since this is when she feels that the months of hard work are providing their reward in the quality of her fruit.  Lurgia considers the most difficult part of her work to be transporting her produce from her farm to the wholesale warehouses which are located in the town of San Francisco.  This is where they offer her the best prices for her products.\r\n\r\nLurgia's problem is that she doesn't have a coffee depulping machine which is very useful in shelling coffee beans.  This is why she is requesting a loan from MFP.  In the future, Lurgia would like to increase her crops by growing more coffee plants since she has 2 hectares of land which are not currently cultivated.  This is Lurgia's eighth loan from MFP and she hopes to be able to repay her loan on time since she doesn't want to make trouble for the other members of her community bank.  Lurgia is a well-liked member of her community bank because of the order that she brings to the group.\r\n\r\nLurgia will use the 1,000 Peruvian soles she is requesting to buy a depulping machine to shell her coffee beans."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":742076,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy a depulping machine","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-04-02T23:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lurgia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-03-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":375}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":375,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:42:12Z","rounded_local_amount":1054.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244621122}],"funded_date":"2011-04-03T15:56:07Z","paid_date":"2011-12-15T10:42:12Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Oxnard","image":null}},{"id":290802,"name":"Tayson Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El grupo Tayson lo conforman tres personas trabajadoras, esforzadas y emprendedoras.

Her husband works as a security guard and they have two children, 11 and 18, one of whom attends a public school. Her business is food prep and sales. \r\n\r\nShe began her business three years ago through her mom who prepared lunches. One day her mom passed away and she ended up with the business, so that is how she chose it. She works alone making lunches from 10 a.m. until 2 p.m. Monday through Saturday. With the help of the loan she wants to buy pots, tubs and a kitchenette to improve her business and increase her earnings. Her hope is to open up a storefront of her own for her restaurant and that later her children would manage it. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":779466,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to purchase pots, tubs and a kitchenette.

Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 300 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php 11,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory and for the maintenance of her sewing machine. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nMary Ann hopes to be able to expand soon and dreams to be able to give her children a good and high quality education through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

Before joining One Acre Fund, Eliud was only able to harvest five bags of maize on one acre of land.\r\n\r\nWith this loan, One Acre Fund will purchase fertilizer, seeds, and other important inputs to distribute to Eliud and his group during Kenya\u2019s next planting season in February 2012. The distribution of farming inputs is part of One Acre Fund\u2019s integrated agriculture package, which includes training, reliable input supply (such as fertilizer and seeds), credit and insurance.\r\n\r\nWith income from his maize sales, Eliud will educate his children and build a house.\r\n\r\nIn 2012, the members of Bienjelesia group will each plant maize plots between \u00bd and 1 acre of land.\r\n\r\nEliud is pictured with his group members in the photograph above.

above picture presents Pamela, a practical, intelligent, and ingenious woman. She has always liked everything related to farming.\nShe is an old fox in this field, as she has dedicated all of her life to this wonderful profession.\nPamela is a farmer from Kitale in Kenya who has defied the common thinking of most Kenyans about agriculture. Pamela is a proud owner of a small parcel of land on which she has been practicing mixed farming for the past ten years. Her primary sources of income have been from planting crops, milk, eggs and a variety of vegetables. She also engages in some personal business to make ends meet. \n\nPamela passionately loves farming. She got interested in farming out of a desire to be a solution to food security which remains a big problem in her remote village. From farming, she has been able to earn a decent income and she attributes all this success to hard work and determination. Although she makes profits, she has always wanted to increase her farming and start a cereal-selling business. The main challenge she faces is lack of funds. \n\nShe is seeking a loan to buy cereal. Demand for cereal is overwhelming in Kitale and through this loan she will buy different varieties of cereal. This will help her satisfy the demand in her village and local market. \n\nWith this loan, Pamela will improve her living conditions through increased profits from selling cereal. \n\nPamela has been practicing agriculture with energy, enthusiasm and knowledge attained through training from Juhudi Kilimo. She believes that her cereal-selling business will grow in leaps and bounds. There is no doubt that through this loan, Pamela's life will change permanently. It will ensure her 4 school-going children have a secure future.\nLenders! If there is someone that you should invest in with a loan during this festive season then that person is Pamela. You can help Pamela to accomplish all her dreams, and a loan will do that for her.\n"}},"status":"inactive","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":2039641,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy cereals","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kitale","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1.016667 35","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":500,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Pamela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-11-30T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":1466.53},{"due_date":"2016-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":1509.39},{"due_date":"2016-02-29T08:00:00Z","amount":1553.5},{"due_date":"2016-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":1598.9},{"due_date":"2016-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":1645.63},{"due_date":"2016-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":1693.72},{"due_date":"2016-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":1743.22},{"due_date":"2016-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":1794.17},{"due_date":"2016-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":1846.6},{"due_date":"2016-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":1900.57},{"due_date":"2016-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":1956.11},{"due_date":"2016-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":2013.28},{"due_date":"2016-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":2072.12},{"due_date":"2017-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":2132.68},{"due_date":"2017-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":2195},{"due_date":"2017-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":2259.15},{"due_date":"2017-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":2325.18},{"due_date":"2017-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":2393.13},{"due_date":"2017-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":2463.07},{"due_date":"2017-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":2535.05},{"due_date":"2017-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":2609.14},{"due_date":"2017-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":2685.39},{"due_date":"2017-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":2763.87},{"due_date":"2017-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":2844.6}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":14.67},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15.09},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.53},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.99},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.46},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.94},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.43},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.94},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.47},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.01},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":19.56},{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.13},{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.72},{"due_date":"2017-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.33},{"due_date":"2017-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.95},{"due_date":"2017-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.59},{"due_date":"2017-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.25},{"due_date":"2017-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.93},{"due_date":"2017-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.63},{"due_date":"2017-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.35},{"due_date":"2017-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.09},{"due_date":"2017-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.85},{"due_date":"2017-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.64},{"due_date":"2018-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.45}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":992320,"name":"Melanie","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"As a married mother of four children, Melanie works hard to support her family.\n\nShe has a general store business in the Philippines.

name is Chova-Chova Domingos B., and I am a 56-year-old native of Chilembene, Chokwe district, Gaza province. I grew up under the care of my parents; however, the family\u2019s financial situation offered me few opportunities to attend school. I started working as a young boy at the age of 12. At 22 I began to work in South Africa as a miner. I worked there 3 years before returning to Mozambique in 1975. Since 1984 I have assumed the full administrative duties of the family\u2019s business and owned a territory with more than 50 hectares. Starting in 2006, through some neighbors' suggestions, I met Hluvuku-Adsema and solicited information about obtaining a loan for the expansion of my business. My business is in horticulture; I sell cabbage, peppers and tomatoes at the principal market in the district of Boane and the city of Maputo. Currently I employ 4 valuable workers, and when I am in need of help I contract someone with potential. The revenues help me support my basic needs, including the education and health of 7 children. With the loan I intend to purchase fuel for a motorized water pump and agricultural seeds and fertilizers. \r\n<p>Chova-Chova\u2019s impact on the community is great because outside of providing employment for herself and four others she places the product nearer to the client.

She lives with her husband in a large traditional family in Fama, in downtown Sikasso (third administrative region of the Republic of Mali). After running several unsuccessful businesses, she started selling traditional soaps (black soap) five years ago, a business she learned from one of her neighbors. She runs this business at home in Sikasso, where she's very much in demand due to the quality of her products.\r\n\r\nTo meet an ever-increasing customer demand, she decided to join Kiva's partner, the microfinance organization Soro Yiriwaso, three years ago. She's seeking her fourth individual loan, and all previous loans were repaid without problems.

He is married with Esidora Quispe, 42 years old, and the fruit of their immense love is their 5 children. They live together in their own home in the community of Carmen Pampa near San Francisco. Satan is an agriculturist and his parents taught him the business since he was a boy. He has been working his fields for 20 years, cultivating the following products: cocoa, coffee, and bananas. During the harvest season he depends on his family's support and that of hired laborers. He knows that his earnings directly depend on the quality of the harvest. He sells his cocoa and coffee harvest in the city of San Francisco where he gets the best prices for the quality of the grains. What he most enjoys about his work is the harvest because he is able to see that months\u2019 worth of hard work have not been in vain. In the future he wants to buy more land to increase production. This is his 16th loan with MFP (Kiva Field Partner) and it will be a great support in the progress of his business. He is very well liked by the other members of the communal bank, especially because he is united with them. With the two thousand nuevos soles he requests he will purchase more fertilizer to improve the quality of his fields."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":705586,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To purchase fertilizers for his land.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-02-03T17:50:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":725,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Esteban ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-01-27T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-27T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-27T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":725}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":725,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:47:48Z","rounded_local_amount":2004.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232850579}],"funded_date":"2011-02-16T23:02:01Z","paid_date":"2011-10-15T09:47:48Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":274423,"name":"Asha","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Asha is a married woman who owns a house that has electricity but not running water.

She lives with her son in her own house.  She learned farming when she was very young, planting and harvesting potatoes and other crops, all thanks to her father who was a farmer.  Farming has become her main source of income now.  She plants potatoes, olluco, maize and beans because there's a lot of demand for them.  She also sells what she grows in her own shop.  She says that she likes farming because it is what she knows best, even though it requires much sacrifice.  She has to get up at dawn every day to work her fields but it's worth the effort at harvest time.  She takes her crop to market and sells to the wholesalers there who pay her with real money!  She, in turn, uses the money to provide a better quality of life for her child.  Epifania is an enterprising woman and she wants to plant more crops in the future and increase her production.  She also wants to stock her store with various products because, she says, the business is very profitable.  This is Epifania's second MFP loan.

Many years ago her father lent her 500 lempiras and with that she bought some second hand clothing to later resell it to her neighbors. She made a profit from her sales and then bought more merchandise.  \n\nAfter a while she became aware of FAMA and requested a loan which she was granted and with that she was able to change her business. Now Luz earns her living selling seasonings, which she learned from one of her sisters who was in the business and did very well. \n\nThree of her four children help her prepare the seasonings and later she goes out to the nearby villages to sell them. She travels by hitchhiking. She goes out to the street and waits until someone she knows passes by and picks her up. She makes her sales every 15 days but she also makes sales from her house permanently. Her biggest obstacles are the weather and, when she is unable to find a ride, having to walk long distances.\n\nWith the support of this loan she will buy seasonings such as annatto, spices, cinnamon, cloves, rosemary, linseed, as well as little bags and staples for packaging. She will be able to supply her business with the support of this loan and she hopes her sales increase. Her goal is to continue supporting her children so that they will graduate. Two of them already have graduated thanks to her effort. \n\nLuz has been a client of FAMA for 15 loan cycles and she is punctual with her repayments.  \n       "}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1850,"image":{"id":807568,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to purchase seasonings.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"Juticalpa, Olancho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15 -86.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":168,"posted_date":"2011-07-22T18:10:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1850,"lender_count":68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Luz Benita ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elvia Rosa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nanci Jakeline ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosa Celenia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Leidy Liceira ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Suyapa Argentina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-06-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":34500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":1850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":8625},{"due_date":"2011-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":8625},{"due_date":"2011-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":8625},{"due_date":"2011-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":8625}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":462.5},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":462.5},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":462.5},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":462.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":925,"local_amount":17250,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:43:51Z","rounded_local_amount":17477.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221657985},{"amount":925,"local_amount":17250,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T08:51:46Z","rounded_local_amount":17477.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232784925}],"funded_date":"2011-07-23T18:57:20Z","paid_date":"2011-10-15T08:51:46Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Monica Wooters","image":null}},{"id":319503,"name":"And Soukali Jeeguene Pire 24 Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Ce groupe est compos\u00e9 de 5 membres qui habitent dans le village de Pire \u00e0 cent km de DAKAR la capitale du S\u00e9n\u00e9gal, leur activit\u00e9 principale est le commerce de produits agricoles  les tubercules de manioc.

In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go buy one sachet of shampoo, a PHP5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She makes money by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. She also sells electronic cell phone loads (prepaid cell phone credits) and offers direct-selling products to her customer. Her store is adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She has a minimum of PHP 400 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 11,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, beverages, and other products needed in her business. She expects a boost in her income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nMa.Teresa hopes to be able to expand soon and dreams to be able to give her children a high-quality education through all her hard work in her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

Ella tiene, 7 vacas, 3 chanchos, pero antes contaba con varias ovejas a las que vend\u00eda y sacaba buenas ganancias. Por problemas de mala administraci\u00f3n y sobre-gastos, no pudieron comprar m\u00e1s de estos animales para continuar con el negocio. As\u00ed empezaron a sembrar papa, en las peque\u00f1as parcelas que posee, de esa manera pudo pagar sus deudas. Considera que su negocio es rentable, \u201cpor cabeza ganaba  de 15 a 20 soles\u201d, comenta. En el futuro, ella espera volver al ritmo anterior, y seguir con la venta de los carneros, administrar bien sus negocios y mandar a sus peque\u00f1os hijos a estudiar a la ciudad de Tarma y m\u00e1s adelante facilitarles una educaci\u00f3n superior y profesional. Es la octava vez que ella trabaja con MFP. Est\u00e1 entusiasmada con las visiones que tiene, y que espera alcanzar gracias a su trabajo coordinado.

She and her family live in her mother\u2019s house.\r\n\r\nVer\u00f3nica is a small quantity livestock merchant.  She has 7 cows and 3 pigs.  She used to have several sheep that she\u2019d sell and make good profits.  Because of poor administration and cost overruns she was unable to buy more of these animals to continue in business.  They started to grow potatoes on the small plots of land she has and was able to repay her debts that way.\r\n\r\nShe considers her business to be profitable.  \u201cFor each head I\u2019d earn 15 to 20 soles,\u201d she comments.  In the future she hopes to recover her previous rhythm and continue to sell sheep, to run her business well and to send her children to school in the city of Tarma and later on provide them with higher and professional education.\r\n\r\nThis is the 8th time she\u2019s worked with MFP.  She\u2019s excited with the vision she has and that she hopes to reach thanks to coordinated work.  Ver\u00f3nica will use her loan to buy at least 7 small lambs.

He also takes care of his two grandchildren, the children of his daughter. He decided to take up the responsibility of his grandchildren together with their mother (his daughter) since she had the two children out of wedlock. Rather than send his daughter away, he encouraged and cautioned her to take care of herself not to get another child until she is ready to take care of them. They live in Kayole, an informal settlement area within Nairobi. In addition, Mr. W. is a church pastor, and he also supports some of his church members.\r\n<p>\r\nWilson has been a carpenter now for a period of four years and apart from that, he also does welding. He started by doing small contracts from schools within his community. It was not an easy start but he was driven by determination since he wanted to be involved in another activity besides being a pastor. He borrowed Ksh 20,000.00 (USD 285) from a friend and bought the basic items he needed in the carpentry workshop together with timber. He has been able to settle this loan with time and although he has had many difficulties, he has seen his business expanding through the many contracts he is getting. His major setback is the ability to deal with the growing number of contracts since his customers pay a minimal deposit, barely enough to enable him to make purchases for the requirements. He is now intending to make a set of desks and chairs for two schools within his community before schools reopen for the second term.\r\n<p>\r\nA loan of USD 900 is Wilson\u2019s plea to enable him purchase a drilling machine, timber, block board, and the backs and seats for the chairs. These will go a long way in enabling him to make a wide range of quality furniture for his customers in order to attract additional customers, and to retain the existing ones, especially from the nearby schools. This will also enable him to gain additional income that will help him to support both his family and members of his church better. The repayment period of the loan is 15 \u2013 18 months.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":900,"image":{"id":23443,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Carpentry","sector":"Construction","themes":null,"use":"Purchase

With renewed spirit everyday, Indriani left her home by 5:00 am to the market to buy her inventory. With an initial capital of $107, Indriani completes her convenient kiosk with snacks, drinks and everyday household supplies. Indriani's kiosk is open from 6:00 am to 6:00 pm. The profit that she earns is used to help her husband, Nengah Yudiartama, who has his own business. Indriani also uses her profits to meet her financial needs and pay for her children's elementary school and kindergarten tuitions. Her house is built on a land that they purchased with quite solid structure.

Dengan modal awal Rp.1.000.000, Indriani melengkapi isi warungnya dengan bermacam-macam barang dagangan seperti makanan ringan,  minuman ringan dan kebutuhan keluarga sehari \u2013 hari.. Indriani membuka warungnya pada pagi hari pukul 06.00 pagi dan tutup pada pukul 06.00 sore. Keuntungan yang didapatnya dipakai untuk membantu suaminya, Nengah Yudiartama, yang bekerja sebagai wiraswasta. Keuntungan itu juga dipergunakan untuk memenuhi kebutuhan ekonominya dan juga untuk pendidikan anak-anaknya yang masih sekolah SD dan yang kecil masih TK. Rumahnya dibangun ditanah sendiri dengan bangunan yang cukup permanen. Pinjaman Dinari dipakai untuk menambah modal usaha dan mengembangkan usahanya."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":191000,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To buy more inventory and display racks","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Melaya, Bali","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":82,"posted_date":"2008-08-16T08:00:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ni Made Indriani","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-08-30T21:07:35Z","disbursal_currency":"IDR","disbursal_amount":5000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":416666.67},{"due_date":"2008-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":416666.67},{"due_date":"2008-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":416666.67},{"due_date":"2008-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":416666.67},{"due_date":"2009-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":416666.67},{"due_date":"2009-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":416666.67},{"due_date":"2009-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":416666.67},{"due_date":"2009-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":416666.67},{"due_date":"2009-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":416666.67},{"due_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":416666.67},{"due_date":"2009-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":416666.67},{"due_date":"2009-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":416666.63}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":46,"local_amount":418181.82,"processed_date":"2008-09-22T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-09-29T07:22:48Z","rounded_local_amount":421728,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":334336},{"amount":91.5,"local_amount":831818.19,"processed_date":"2008-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-19T20:04:55Z","rounded_local_amount":838872.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5308536},{"amount":45.83,"local_amount":416666.67,"processed_date":"2008-12-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-22T08:56:37Z","rounded_local_amount":420200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9925462},{"amount":45.83,"local_amount":416666.67,"processed_date":"2009-01-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-18T08:02:17Z","rounded_local_amount":420200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14849759},{"amount":45.83,"local_amount":416666.67,"processed_date":"2009-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-21T08:00:49Z","rounded_local_amount":420200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20389191},{"amount":45.83,"local_amount":416666.67,"processed_date":"2009-03-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-17T08:03:39Z","rounded_local_amount":420200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27080596},{"amount":45.83,"local_amount":416666.67,"processed_date":"2009-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-19T08:23:55Z","rounded_local_amount":420200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35973822},{"amount":45.83,"local_amount":416666.67,"processed_date":"2009-05-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T22:29:59Z","rounded_local_amount":420200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44434524},{"amount":45.83,"local_amount":416666.67,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T20:06:24Z","rounded_local_amount":420200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52945060},{"amount":45.82,"local_amount":416666.67,"processed_date":"2009-07-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T12:46:50Z","rounded_local_amount":420199.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63165850},{"amount":45.87,"local_amount":416666.63,"processed_date":"2009-08-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T14:02:33Z","rounded_local_amount":420200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73591229}],"funded_date":"2008-08-16T21:07:35Z","paid_date":"2009-09-15T14:02:33Z","journal_totals":{"entries":4,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":64625,"name":"Maria Antonia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La Sra.

This area is famous for its agricultural production of corn, potatoes, and other crops.  Tourist attractions such as the Cochapamba Lagoon are filled with reeds used for making mats, hats, and decorations.  Tasqui Hill provides a beautiful view of the parish and the entire city of Cuenca.  The people are very warm and friendly.  \r\n<p>\r\nSra. Rosa L. is one of the founding members of this Communal Bank.  She lives in the community of San Miguel in the El Valle Parish of Cuenca.  She is 32 years old, married, and has 5 children ranging in age from 1 to 18.  Her two oldest sons (the first and third children) are students at the Salesiano Technical School.  Her oldest daughter (the second child) graduated from a sewing academy and now works in order to contribute to the household expenses.  The second youngest child attends kindergarten in San Miguel.  Her husband works as a bricklayer, which has helped her family get ahead.  The most gratifying result of her hard work is being able to own a home.  \r\n<p>\r\nRosa raises animals such as chickens, pigs, and guinea pigs.  She has been engaged in this business for several years and sells her animals in the community and at local fairs.  Rosa has worked with the Foundation on 19 previous loan cycles.  The funding she has received has benefited her home and her business.  With this new loan, she will buy more chickens and guinea pigs since they grow faster.  She will also purchase feed for the animals.  Her goal is to gradually increase the number of other animals that she raises so that her family can get ahead.  \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva

G. is the leader of a group of five borrowers called Barclay Farm United.  He is 26 years old, married, and has two girls.  One of his girls is six years old and is in the 1st grade, the other is 3 months old.  F. and his family live in the Barclay Farm Community in Harbel, about 40 miles from the capital of Liberia, Monrovia.  He also helps care for two of his siblings who live with him, and regularly sends money to his parents who are farmers in Lofa County in northwest Liberia.\r\n\r\nF. currently attends night school, and is enrolled in the 11th grade.  His education was interrupted by the Liberian civil war, when his family went to neighboring Guinea to escape the fighting.  He sells hardware and tools from a stall at the Harbel Market, which is located on the Firestone Rubber Plantation.  Firestone's plantation in Liberia is one of the largest in the world, with a million acres under long-term lease from the Liberian government.\r\n\r\nF. says he started his business with 4,000 Liberian dollars in seed money from his father.  He originally sold tools and hardware from a wheelbarrow, but thanks to his hard work and perseverance he has been able to move up to selling at the market.  He hopes to move his shop to a storefront one day soon.  With his 6,000 Liberian dollar portion of this 30,000 Liberian dollar group loan, F. plans to buy more inventory for his business, such as nails, cutlasses (machetes), shovels, and hammers.\r\n\r\nF. credits his success in business to selling quality items and treating his customers well.  In future, he wants to have more children and hopes to be able to send them all to school so they get a good education.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the photo that accompanies this profile, F. is the one holding the sign.

caracteriza, pues aunque no tiene maquinaria, ofrece vestidos para ni\u00f1as y accesorios a la medida y al gusto de sus clientes; su negocio consiste en comprar telas  e insumos de modister\u00eda para mandarle a fabricar a 3 confeccionistas, los mas fant\u00e1sticos vestidos, combinados con accesorios arm\u00f3nicos y adornos como sombreros cintillos, binchas adornadas, para ni\u00f1as que participan como ninfas, damas de honor en matrimonios, o en cumplea\u00f1os, bautizos y ocasiones elegantes y especiales de las familias. Mediante este sistema Aura  suministra a cr\u00e9dito y a muy buen precio sus productos, porque para ella es  muy  claro que con su calidad en los precios ella compite. Sus clientes   son  almacenes en los centro de Barranquilla y en muchas ciudades y municipios de la costa caribe como Bosconia, en el Departamento del Cesar,  Cienaga en el Departamento del Magdalena y Monter\u00eda en el Departamento de C\u00f3rdoba,  donde viaja semanalmente llevando sus productos  junto a su libreta de cuentas por cobrar para recuperar su dinero.\n\nElla trabaja en horario extendido y ha progresado mucho desde su primer cr\u00e9dito con la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo hasta la presente, sus ventas se han incrementado en un 50% y as\u00ed mismo sus ingresos y utilidades. Hoy est\u00e1 solicitando su tercer financiamiento y desea prepararse para la temporada alta del segundo semestre del a\u00f1o, comprando materias primas al  por mayor y de contado e insumos como telas y adornos para poder mandar a elaborar los dise\u00f1os mas apetecidos.\nSu meta y gran desaf\u00edo es hacer de sus hijos unos profesionales, ya que la mayor se grad\u00faa este a\u00f1o como bachiller y el menor terminar\u00e1 su nivel de primaria, por lo que tiene que  seguir realizando muchos esfuerzos  desde su populoso barrio ubicado en el sur de Barranquilla muy cerca de centros comerciales y del famoso estadio donde juega el equipo de futbol que mas quiere la ciudad: \u201cEl Junior de Barranquilla\u201d\n","en":"If you knew Se\u00f1ora Aura O., you\u2019d know that she personifies \u201csaleswoman.\u201d  Even though she doesn\u2019t have machines, she sells little girls\u2019 dresses and accessories to the size and preference of her customers.  Her business is buying material and dressmaking supplies to send out to three seamstresses.  The most fantastic dresses combined with the right accessories and adornments like headbands for hats and decorated binchas for girls who participate as nymphs, bridesmaids, or in birthdays, baptisms, elegant occasions, and special family events.\r\n\r\nThrough this system Aura sells her products on credit, and at a good price, because it is very clear to her that quality and price compete.  Her customers are stores in Barranquilla and in many cities and municipalities of the Caribbean coast like Bosconia in the Department of Cesar, Cienaga in the Department of Magdalena, and Monter\u00eda in the Department of C\u00f3rdoba where she travels weekly bringing her products alongside her accounting book to collect her money.  \r\n\r\nShe works extended hours and has progressed a lot since her first loan with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo to the present.  Her sales have increased by 50% as well as her earnings and profits. Today she is taking out her third loan and wants to get ready for the high season (the second semester of the year) by buying wholesale raw materials and supplies like fabrics and decorations, paying in full, to be able to send out to have the best designs made.\r\n\r\nHer goal, and great challenge, is to make her children professionals since the oldest graduates from high school this year and the youngest finishes grade school.  She has to keep going as much as possible from her populous neighborhood, south of Barranquilla, very close to malls and the famous stadium where the city\u2019s most beloved team \u201cEl Junior de Barranquilla\u201d plays.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Shelly Hubman, Kiva

For the past four years, she has been working in the sale of semi-Brazilian jewelry.  She has been married for over 13 years and has 3 children.  Her home is located by el Puente el Salto, in the Manabita capital.  She purchases with cash the jewelry and makes a 50% profit.  She buys the jewelry in the city of Portoviejo from a distributor.  She enjoys her business and wants to continue it because of the earnings and the benefits.  Our member began with $50 in capital.  Her method of selling her products is by traveling throughout the city and offering them to her friends but allowing them to pay in 2 payments.  Her husband is a security guard at a company in Portoviejo.  She is from the Manabita capital, while he is from the port city, Manta.  She plans to invest this loan in her jewelry business by purchasing earrings, necklaces, and rings.

She earns her living by operating two business ventures: fishing and fish vending. \r\n\r\nHer husband, Joel C., who is 49 years old, works as a fisherman to earn his living, and also helps in his wife's business activities. They have seven children who are 7 to  20 years old. \r\n\r\nMa. Sunny joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2004 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 10 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Ma. Sunny has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 14,500 PHP helped her earn a monthly profit of 7,500 PHP, uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 11th cycle loan, she is borrowing 19,500 PHP, which she intends to use to purchase additional fishing equipment so that she can continue to save up for the future of her children. \r\n\r\nMa. Sunny C. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

With her husband\u2019s income missing, bills started to pile up, and she decided to generate her own income to try to fill the gap. She likes what she sells and has developed a stable enterprise. \r\n\r\nCurrently Muhabbat has requested a loan in the size of $1000 USD to help purchase a new supply of items to sell.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is married to Juan, an overseas Filipino worker, and is the mother to their three children. She, together with her husband, manages their own household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income to cover their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nRegina operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries, and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a PHP5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Aside from this, she also does some direct selling. Her store is adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She makes a minimum of PHP 450 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 13,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nRegina hopes to be able to expand soon and dreams to be able to give her children a high-quality education through all her hard work in her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay Micro Finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":890087,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To pay for grocery items and products needed in her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Caloocan City","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2011-10-14T03:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":300,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Regina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-09-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":13000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":866.67},{"due_date":"2011-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":866.67},{"due_date":"2011-09-29T07:00:00Z","amount":866.67},{"due_date":"2011-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":866.67},{"due_date":"2011-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":866.67},{"due_date":"2011-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":866.67},{"due_date":"2011-10-27T07:00:00Z","amount":866.67},{"due_date":"2011-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":866.67},{"due_date":"2011-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":866.67},{"due_date":"2011-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":866.67},{"due_date":"2011-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":866.67},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":866.67},{"due_date":"2011-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":866.67},{"due_date":"2011-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":866.67},{"due_date":"2011-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":866.62}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":140,"local_amount":6067,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T09:37:11Z","rounded_local_amount":6100.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238571850},{"amount":80,"local_amount":3466,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:31:49Z","rounded_local_amount":3484.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244529400},{"amount":80,"local_amount":3467,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T09:39:25Z","rounded_local_amount":3485.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250738616}],"funded_date":"2011-10-15T10:06:03Z","paid_date":"2012-01-15T09:39:25Z","journal_totals":{"entries":4,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Victoria Lazarova","image":1669010}},{"id":348232,"name":"Richard","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Richard is a 23-year-old married man with one child and owns a house in Kasese, Uganda.

Everyone in his village of Cabaiesti, and most rural areas throughout Moldova grew up around farm animals.  Most families in rural Moldova will have a small garden behind their house, chickens, possibly a few cows or a pig and maybe a horse for a carriage to help with daily activities and transportation (Most of these houses do not have running water, gas or plumbing and rely on an outhouse as a toilette). Mihail\u2019s family has always had a small farm, but he has not been involved in more commercial production. He would like to start now, having seen others in the area become successful entrepreneurs in raising animals. His brother owns a large barn formerly used in a collective farm, which, is already outfitted with most of the necessary equipment he needs and is an ideal location for Mihail\u2019s planned business. The operation would encompass 30 sheep, which would be used for milk production, cheese making called Brinza, as well as for wool, and 10 calves, which would be raised in part for reproduction and in part for meat. Mihail already has land on which he grows wheat and hay, which will serve as good feed for all the animals.

Nearly 10 years ago she decided to open a little wall-paper kiosk, a business she says was her calling. She was able to purchase a kiosk in the very center of the market that is easily accessible to many shoppers. Today, Tatyana\u2019s business yields $450 a month in profit with an investment of $2,000 in inventory. \r\n\r\nTatyana sees a great opportunity for business grown as spring approaches. Wall-papering is a very popular way to decorate in Ukraine and many people are ready to begin remodeling work after the cold and wet winter months are past. Tatyana\u2019s expertise in quality wall-paper is greatly appreciated by her customers. Her desire to assist clients and her entrepreneurial spirit are part of what makes her business successful. On a personal level, Tatyana desires to invest her earned profits into her son\u2019s college education. \r\n\r\nTatyana has requested a loan for $1,000 to broaden the assortment of wall-paper she offers at her kiosk so she will be ready for the busy season. She has proven to be a strong and reliable client with \u201cNadiya Ukraine\u201d.

Thi Hai, 45 years old, has 5 children. 2 of them are grown-up and have stable jobs. In 2003, Mrs. Hai joined the TYM Fund to expand her inventory for business. Currently, her main source of income is from selling products made from bamboo. With her experiences and ability to foresee the demand of the villagers, she has made and sold more and more products. To increase her family's income, she also raises livestock. As such, her family's standard of living has been improving and her children are better taken care of. This time, she would like to borrow 19,000,000VND (1150USD) to continue investing in her business.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Vietnamese by Yen Thanh Pham, Kiva

Because of his work, her husband does not live with her right now.  She has a small family business that offers fumigation services.  She has been running the business out of her home for the past 10 months, in an office that she put in to attend to her customers.  Everyone is very content with the service Elizabeth and her brother have been offering.  But the lack of investment capital limits the customers they can serve because they don\u2019t have the necessary supplies for fumigation.  However, they keep moving forward by offering the best service possible with the resources that they have.  Thanks to this business she is able to be with her family, especially her young son, without having to give up her job as a businesswoman.  She has been able to make this a profitable business and she is sure that in the future it will be an even more prosperous company.  Elizabeth has worked with MFP for 3 years  and is very happy with the financial support this institution offers.  With the money from this loan she will invest in large quantities of sprayers that will increase her earnings.  Buying the machines will help her serve more locations and perform routine maintenance.    help her serve more locations and perform routine maintenance.   <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Rachel Crouch, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":271988,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"Fumigation sprayers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-02-17T20:30:11Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":625,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elizabeth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":210.9},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":228.91},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":231.37},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":244.16},{"due_date":"2009-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":253.49},{"due_date":"2009-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":266.56},{"due_date":"2009-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":276.83},{"due_date":"2009-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":287.78}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":65.91},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":71.53},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.3},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.3},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.22},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.3},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.51},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.93}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":65.91,"local_amount":210.9,"processed_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T20:05:49Z","rounded_local_amount":214.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20423760},{"amount":71.53,"local_amount":228.91,"processed_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:37:24Z","rounded_local_amount":232.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27117069},{"amount":72.3,"local_amount":231.37,"processed_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:47:16Z","rounded_local_amount":235.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36011982},{"amount":76.3,"local_amount":244.16,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T01:02:37Z","rounded_local_amount":248.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44595567},{"amount":79.22,"local_amount":253.49,"processed_date":"2009-06-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:41:37Z","rounded_local_amount":257.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52989829},{"amount":83.3,"local_amount":266.56,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:46:43Z","rounded_local_amount":271.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63210965},{"amount":86.51,"local_amount":276.83,"processed_date":"2009-08-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:23:49Z","rounded_local_amount":281.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73640470},{"amount":89.93,"local_amount":287.78,"processed_date":"2009-09-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:36:42Z","rounded_local_amount":292.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87080117}],"funded_date":"2009-02-17T23:11:50Z","paid_date":"2009-10-15T23:36:42Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Rachel Crouch","image":59003}},{"id":93327,"name":"Chhet","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Chhet M., 49, is a widow who lives with three of her children in the Siem Reap province.

From a young age he demonstrated a talent for agriculture.  He has always tried to be very responsible and today he has a crop of 25-30 sacks of potatoes that he grows in transitional fields.  He also grows beans and corn in irrigated fields.  Aquiles is very content with his farmwork.  When he finishes caring for his crops, he goes to help his father, because he wants to repay his father\u2019s efforts.  What his father likes best out of the whole agricultural process is the marketing, because he always hopes to get a good price for his crops.  But once he gets to the market, he gets a little clumsy and sometimes loses track of the accounting.  Aquiles always tries to help him out with some pointers.  Aquiles is the president of his community bank and this is his 8th loan with MFP.  In all of this time he has proven to be very responsible, both in his duties and in his payments.  The  loan he is asking for is to purchase fertilizer for his varied crops.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Rachel Crouch, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":975,"image":{"id":293317,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Fertilizer","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-03-24T20:30:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":975,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Aquiles","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-03-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":975,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":3000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":975}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":975,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2009-09-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:33:57Z","rounded_local_amount":3066.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87080290}],"funded_date":"2009-03-24T20:47:15Z","paid_date":"2009-10-15T23:33:57Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Rachel Crouch","image":59003}},{"id":101519,"name":"Remi","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Remi D. is 32 years old and married with 2 children.

Vanessa wants to help her husband in earning income for their family.\r\nIn 2008, she decided to join ASHI (Ahon Sa Hirap, Inc.), an MFI and KIVA partner in the Philippines. She used her previous loans for her fishing business. Since Cardona is a coastal municipality and the main source of income for the people is fishing, she wants to continue her fishing business and continue putting additional investment into it. Now on her third loan, she requests a loan of 14,000 pesos as additional capital for her fishing business. Specifically, the loan will be used to pay for 10 bundles of fish nets, rope, threads for fishing gear and also for the maintenance of her boat.\r\nShe is looking forward for a sustainable and profitable business. She also dreams of having her own house, and to be able to send her children to school until they finish college.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":361512,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fishing","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To

She is happy for the financing because she will be able to offer her students a greater variety of products this new school year that is about to begin.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":477191,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cafe","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To buy sweets, soft-drinks, pastry, rice, meat, chicken, fruits and vegetables.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Managua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.150833 -86.268333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":98,"posted_date":"2010-01-26T00:10:16Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1200,"lender_count":31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Reynelda De Los Angeles","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-01-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":25000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":1200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2010-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2010-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2010-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2010-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2010-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2010-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2010-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2010-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2010-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2011-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2011-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":205.42,"local_amount":4279.51,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T07:50:12Z","rounded_local_amount":4293.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128874593},{"amount":95.59,"local_amount":1991.36,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T08:31:19Z","rounded_local_amount":1997.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144639927},{"amount":100.12,"local_amount":2085.78,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:00:46Z","rounded_local_amount":2092.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151821711},{"amount":103.65,"local_amount":2159.38,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T09:03:53Z","rounded_local_amount":2166.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159561719},{"amount":98.66,"local_amount":2055.52,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T09:17:26Z","rounded_local_amount":2062.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166770644},{"amount":100.85,"local_amount":2101.12,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-16T07:46:28Z","rounded_local_amount":2107.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172204537},{"amount":100.53,"local_amount":2094.45,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T12:02:56Z","rounded_local_amount":2101.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177330247},{"amount":100.48,"local_amount":2093.39,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T11:43:45Z","rounded_local_amount":2100.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182465417},{"amount":204.2,"local_amount":4254.09,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-19T09:09:38Z","rounded_local_amount":4267.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":189097619},{"amount":90.5,"local_amount":1885.4,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T00:47:24Z","rounded_local_amount":1891.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191348284}],"funded_date":"2010-01-26T04:00:24Z","paid_date":"2011-02-16T00:47:24Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":175692,"name":"Antonio","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El se\u00f1or Antonio M. vive en vivienda propia, en la zona German Busch, de la ciudad de El Alto.

Hilda M. is 32 years old and a single woman with four children.  She operates a dairy and lives in an area of Maica Norte, which is a canton of the city of Cochabamba.  Hilda has to raise her children alone because her husband abandoned them a year ago after she became severely ill and had to be hospitalized for six months.  Hilda\u2019s mother stayed with the children while she was in the hospital.  Her fifteen year old daughter quit high school and began working so that she could help her mother recover and pay for the household expenses.  Their bills were numerous since there was no other income besides the milk being sold by Hilda\u2019s mother and children.  After she was discharged from the hospital, Hilda felt guilty that her daughter had to quit school to help her and her children experienced a strong rejection by their father.  Hilda advised them not to mention him again, as if he were dead.\r\n<p>\r\nHilda is requesting a loan to buy two more dairy cows so that she can increase milk production for delivery and to make cheeses to sell at the market.  She feels she has more courage and strength to move her children forward so that they can complete their education.  Her daughter returned to school, but she still helps with gathering the milk and helping her mother in the afternoons make cheeses.  Hilda hopes to improve her income and experience a better standard of living now that they she hasn't accumulated as many expenses as she had a year ago.\r\n<p>\r\nHilda\u2019s mother is very proud of her daughter and granddaughter for persevering and not giving in to everything bad that had happened to them.   Do\u00f1a Carmen (Hilda\u2019s mother) says, \u201cI know my granddaughter will experience success because my daughter will be the one to show her.\u201d\r\n<p>\r\nHilda is still in the process of recovery, but she continues to work hard and manage her dairy responsibly.  She begins work at 4am and then prepares her children for school so that they can become professionals and have a better future than her.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica,

She sells these crops in the city of San Francisco.  \r\n\r\nAt harvest time Marcelina hires field workers to speed up the gathering of her crops.  She has been engaged in this business activity for 17 years.  She feels that the most difficult part is taking care of the crops so that they are not subject to insect infestations.\r\n\r\nIn time, she wants to get new land to expand her crops.\r\n\r\nThis is her third loan with MFP.  She has always been very punctual with her payments, and she has not caused problems in her communal bank.  \r\n\r\nShe will use the requested loan to buy insecticide to combat insect infestation.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":900,"image":{"id":761296,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy insecticides.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-05-02T15:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":900,"lender_count":31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marcelina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-04-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":2500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":900}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":900,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:56:48Z","rounded_local_amount":2545.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238666048}],"funded_date":"2011-05-02T18:22:42Z","paid_date":"2011-11-15T10:56:48Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ginny Kalish"}},{"id":299046,"name":"Marcia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Marcia es socia del  Banco Comunal \u201cNuevo Amanecer\u201d, ubicado en el distrito Juli, provincia Chucuito  y  departamento de Puno, tiene 26 a\u00f1os de edad, es conviviente y tiene tres hijos.
