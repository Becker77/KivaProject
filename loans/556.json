In their loan application, the group described their business as follows:\r\n<p>\r\n\u201cBackground:  The Daw Thiow group is a group of young tailors in Oussouye who have long been active in local development, having chosen as their business sewing and the sale of clothing.  \r\n<p>\r\nObjective:  To contribute to the care of our families and assure continued development of our association.\r\n<p>\r\nBusiness activities:  Purchase of cloth and production of clothing for sale in the local community and region.\u201d \r\n<p>\r\nBackground\r\n<p>\r\nSenegal is one of the world\u2019s poorest countries, yet its solid democratic tradition and highly developed associational life distinguish it from other countries in its income group. Especially remarkable are Senegal\u2019s networks of rotating savings and credit associations, known as tontines. Commonly organized by groups of twenty to thirty housewives who live in the same village, the tontines provide poor women throughout the country with small loans to finance modest income-generating activities. Repayment rates within these associations are excellent, because they are based on local reputation and personal trust between the members. However, their financial resources are limited to the contributions of their members, frequently subsistence farmers with very little disposable income. This has prevented the traditional tontines from meeting the demand for rural microenterprise loans and restricted their impact on the economic development of their communities. The SEM Fund works to bridge this gap by linking traditional village credit associations with outside sources of finance.\r\n<p>\r\nOriginal French business description:\r\n<p>\r\n\u00abContexte : : Le groupement Daw Thiow est un groupement des jeunes tailleurs Oussouye  qui travail depuis tr\u00e8s longtemps dans le cadre de d\u00e9veloppement et Ayant choisit  pour activit\u00e9 ; la couture et l\u2019exposition vente..<p>\r\n Objectif : Contribuer \u00e0 la gestion de nos familles et assoire une bonne politique de d\u00e9veloppement dans notre entourage.\r\n<p>\r\n Activit\u00e9s : Achat  de tissus et confection d\u2019habit vendu dans la commune et dans le  d\u00e9partement\u00bb\r\n<p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":51464,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"Purchase of cloth, lace, etc. for traditional clothing production","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SN","country":"Senegal","town":"Oussouye","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.5 -16.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":4,"posted_date":"2007-07-28T23:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1200,"lender_count":36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Younous","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-08-12T14:43:08Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1200,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":1200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2007-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2007-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2007-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2008-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2008-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2008-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2008-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2008-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2008-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2008-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2008-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":100}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2008-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2008-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":100}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":110,"local_amount":110,"processed_date":"2007-10-06T00:21:40Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-11T09:34:50Z","rounded_local_amount":110,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63294},{"amount":190,"local_amount":190,"processed_date":"2007-11-11T16:25:27Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-11T09:34:50Z","rounded_local_amount":190,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":79992},{"amount":100,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2008-01-03T04:27:51Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-11T09:34:50Z","rounded_local_amount":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":106850},{"amount":200,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2008-02-16T20:58:44Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-11T09:34:50Z","rounded_local_amount":200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136683},{"amount":200,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2008-04-11T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-11T09:34:50Z","rounded_local_amount":200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":179275},{"amount":100,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2008-05-11T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-11T09:34:50Z","rounded_local_amount":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206865},{"amount":100,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2008-06-11T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-11T09:34:50Z","rounded_local_amount":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":234735},{"amount":100,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2008-07-11T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-11T09:34:50Z","rounded_local_amount":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263545},{"amount":100,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2008-08-11T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-11T09:34:50Z","rounded_local_amount":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":292466}],"funded_date":"2007-07-29T14:43:08Z","paid_date":"2008-08-11T09:00:20Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":19203,"name":"Elena","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Elena has a little business selling a variety of items.

From 1987 to 1997, his business was prosperous and he increased his working capital to US$ 400. \r\n\r\nFrom 1997 to 2000, the Equator province was invaded by the war from eastern Congo, and people were forced to leave their homes. He and his family moved to Mbandaka, the main town of the province. From 2000 to 2003, he continued running his business there with restriction due to the war. In 2004 he fell sick and was very often hospitalized for almost a year. He suffered from malaria and bronchitis. He used almost all of his business working capital for medical care. \r\n\r\nAfter recovering, Ferdinand decided to change his business and started to sell lamp oil in 2005 once again with a working capital of US$ 15. He worked very hard, and with good management he increased his working capital to US$ 300 in 2007. After learning through a friend about Hope\u2019s loan program, he decided to join one of its groups in the same year. \r\n\r\nFerdinand has already received five loans from Hope that he repaid correctly. With his next loan he plans to extend his business by adding others items such as bracelets and earrings. His dream is to purchase second-hand appliances from Europe and sell them in Kinshasa.

It is also known for its famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi, and many others. The country, filled with epic mountain passes, is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, and boasts a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture, and Central Asian traditions. \r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 percent of the country is mountainous and only 7 percent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n<p>\r\nMore about IMON International\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition.

She is 47 years old. Lilibeth is the group leader of a 9-member group loan offered by ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nLilibeth is married and has 4 children. To make a living, Lilibeth owns & operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising livestock. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from raising pigs for fattening and sale. Lilibeth has been engaged in her business for over 5 years and earns approximately 3,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nLilibeth joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Lilibeth has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from ASKI. Lilibeth is requesting a new loan of 5000 PHP which will be used to purchase livestock feed & other supplies. This will be the sixth loan taken out by Lilibeth from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay the tuition fees of her children. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 29 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

With the help of her past four loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Ma.Aileen has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 14,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 11,500,  uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her fifth loan, she is borrowing PHP 19,000 to buy products for the store to sell to customers. In addition to her business, she serves in her community as the Barangay Kagawad of their Barangay near to her home.  Ma. Aileen is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

However, the output is rarely enough to satisfy the whole family. To help the difficult situation, two of her daughters decided to work as sewing staff in a garment factory in Phnom Penh and send a part of their monthly salary home to help their parents.\r\n\r\nIn the coming months, one of Chhun\u2019s children is going to get married, thus, Chhun will take responsibilities to manage the party. Consequently, Chhun would like to ask for some funds to prepare the wedding party of her child, which will come soon.

T. is 52 years old and native to the Matutuine district in the province of Maputo.

She grew up with her parents.<p>At 19 years old she married and had 6 children.  She has suffered great pains from the civil war between Frelimo and Renamo having been kidnapped by the enemy army, and even today the effects of the war continue in her memory.<p>\r\n\r\nThanks to the access to credit she has been able to structure her life and without it her life would have continued to be very difficult.  With her activity she is able to support a family of 8 people, between children and grandchildren.  Despite having an official husband, he seldom helps the family due to his low monthly income.<p>With this loan of $1,125US she intends to purchase inventory both of new and different products following the necessities of her customers.  It should be noted that by her great entrepreneurship she sells on foot at different markets each week in the district of Matutuine.  In the future as her age increases she realizes that she is not going to be able to handle the various trips to sell at the markets so she intends to build a small commercial establishment in the village of Bela Vista.<p><b>Translated from Portuguese by Jared Wandry, Kiva Volunteer<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nRaquel T., de 52 anos de idade, natural do Distrito de Matutuine, provincia do Maputo, durante a sua inf\u00e1ncia n\u00e3o teve possibilidade de estudar, devido a distancia que tinha da casa para escola e sendo mulher por questoes culturas havia descriminacao entre filhos e filhas, tendo frequentado at\u00e9 3\u00aa classe.

The broom are made from a long grass which grows in the forest. People that live in the outskirts, especially along the railway, have businesses making brooms and selling them throughout Phnom Penh city. The couple began making and selling brooms in 1998. They have three children, all of whom are employed as garment factory workers.<p> \r\n\r\n<p>She told a loan officer that every month she needs to spend around US$80 on food and US$15 on utility.

Pictured here is 36 years old Tatu M. from Mbeya. She is married with three children who are between the ages of three and 10. \r\n\r\nTatu has been running a business selling used clothes since 1997. Second-hand clothes journey across the oceans from America and Europe, and are then washed, ironed and sold in bulk by wholesalers in Dar es Salaam to retailers. These retailers then re-wash and re-iron them for sale on the streets of Dar es Salaam and the surrounding towns and villages. These clothes are becoming increasingly popular, especially amongst the younger generation, because of their low cost. Furthermore, western or modern clothing is becoming more appealing Some argue that the popularity of the West\u2019s cast-offs is damaging the local cloth and garment industry. There are many people who still appreciate the beauty of traditional Tanzanian dress, however the growing market in used clothing and its importance to many micro-entrepreneurs cannot be denied.\r\n\r\nShe works at the business for nine to 12 hours per day, six days per week and is assisted by one employee and one family member. Tatu currently earns about 60USD a month from her business. She is requesting a loan of 375USD in order to purchase more used clothes in bulk. In the future, she plans to increase the quantity of clothes and to open another business. Tatu thanks you for your support!\r\n\r\nABOUT SELFINA:\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":271084,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Used Clothing","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"To purchase more used clothes in bulk","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbeya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.9 33.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-02-15T02:10:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":" Tatu N.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Maria is a coordinator for her group, La Nueva Esperanza (The New Hope), and her story is representative of the other borrowers in the group.\r\n\r\nMaria has six children, and all but one have moved out of her home. Along with her youngest, a 15-year-old, Maria cares for a local 18-year-old girl who has a child of her own. Two of her children are currently studying in towns around the Dominican Republic, and the others now have families of their own. Maria lives in a batey called L. Blocks. Bateyes are communities built by sugar companies for their workers, and are usually very humble accommodations. Life in a batey can be harsh; they are difficult to access, receive no running water, lack sufficient sanitation, and have little to no electricity. \r\n\r\nDespite these difficulties, Maria runs a successful business selling vehicle necessities, including spare tires, oil, and gasoline. Maria also hopes to expand her business by selling prepaid cell-phone cards. Both her auto supplies and her cell-phone cards help the community have better access to the outsiD. world, and both are in high demand.\r\n\r\nThis is Maria\u2019s sixth loan with Esperanza, and she has been a hard-working borrower for over three years.

Juana works in her home crafting wool garments and other products. Nora also works in the crafting of wool, along with some of the other members who share this activity. Other members work selling sports clothing for women and children. Lourdes works selling stuffed animals. Others work selling salt at the open markets in the area. There are also members who work making jewelry from gold and silver. While there are other similar businesses in the area where the members are developing their businesses, the influx of consumer markets and the continued urban growth make it so that the development of their activities is not adversely affected; on the contrary many members are hoping to grow and extend their businesses which is why they are asking for a loan. The members are asking for credit to be able to buy goods in greater quantities; others to buy materials for construction to enlarge their small shops and to give better service to their customers; other to buy raw materials to increase their working capital. This group is in their second loan cycle and so most of them already know each other and have experience working with this type of loan. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Machelle Wilson, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4275,"image":{"id":421732,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to buy merchandise and raw materiales","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-17 -65","type":"point"}},"partner_id":73,"posted_date":"2009-11-19T08:10:14Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":4275,"lender_count":112,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Yolanda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Benedicta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Julia Marcela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Julia Victoria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nora","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lourdes Lucia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eugenia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Patricia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Isabel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Vilma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Cirila","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juana Brigida","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Delia De","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-10-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":29900,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":4275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-29T07:00:00Z","amount":5688.38},{"due_date":"2009-11-29T08:00:00Z","amount":5830.59},{"due_date":"2009-12-29T08:00:00Z","amount":5976.35},{"due_date":"2010-01-29T08:00:00Z","amount":6125.76},{"due_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":6278.92}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":813.31},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":833.63},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":854.48},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":875.84},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":897.74}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":2501.42,"local_amount":17495.32,"processed_date":"2009-12-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T13:11:02Z","rounded_local_amount":17559.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110678723},{"amount":875.84,"local_amount":6125.76,"processed_date":"2010-01-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:28:09Z","rounded_local_amount":6148.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118073213},{"amount":897.74,"local_amount":6278.92,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-16T08:13:48Z","rounded_local_amount":6302.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123909114}],"funded_date":"2009-12-14T00:39:50Z","paid_date":"2010-03-16T08:13:48Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Machelle Wilson","image":261196}},{"id":154591,"name":"Imelda","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Imelda A. is a 40- year old businesswoman from Baseco Compound, Port Area, Manila.

She lives in her parents' home, and wishes to help them with their household expenses. Although she is still very young, she has decided to work very hard so she doesn't have to depend on her parents; she feels it is time for her to get herself ahead. In order to do this, she makes woven handicrafts, which she sells from a booth in Explanada Laguna Temporal [Seasonal Lagoon Esplanade], a fair location in Juliaca. What she likes most about her job is weaving and making handicrafts. She has been doing this for two years, and she considers transporting the handicrafts to the sales point to be the most difficult part, as it makes her very tired. In the future, she hopes to have a large store for handmade clothing, where she can sell in a more relaxed manner and give better attention to her customers. This is Maritza's third loan with MFP. She has been very punctual in her payments and has never had problems with her communal bank, where she spreads joy that keeps the other members happy. With this loan of 3,000 soles, she will buy better materials to make more woven goods and increase the quantity she has in stock.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Trisha Bury, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":476188,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Weaving","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"Purchase materials for woven handicrafts","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Juliaca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15.5 -70.133333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-01-23T19:40:15Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1075,"lender_count":39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maritza","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-12-24T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2010-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2010-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2010-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2010-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2010-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":179.17},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":179.16},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":179.17},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":179.17},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":179.16},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":179.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":179.17,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2010-01-25T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:10:39Z","rounded_local_amount":510.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118124522},{"amount":179.16,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2010-02-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:49:14Z","rounded_local_amount":510.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123960263},{"amount":179.17,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2010-03-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:33:11Z","rounded_local_amount":510.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128993107},{"amount":179.17,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2010-04-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:37:52Z","rounded_local_amount":510.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136717893},{"amount":179.16,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2010-05-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:39:38Z","rounded_local_amount":510.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144751568},{"amount":179.17,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2010-06-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:02:47Z","rounded_local_amount":510.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151934036}],"funded_date":"2010-01-24T06:09:17Z","paid_date":"2010-07-15T10:02:47Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Trisha Bury","image":804995}},{"id":175325,"name":"Ceferina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Cerefina A. is a resident of Quisao, Tanay, Rizal.

He is married to Odette Nyonga and they are blessed with three children and all are below the age of 15 years old. He and the family live in a small house of three rooms. He lives in Nitop III, a quarter in Bamenda North West Region of Cameroon.\r\n\r\nAdolf has faced some challenges in life. Amongst which are the inability to meet the basic necessities of his family, like clothing, feeding, transportation and educating himself and his children. It is difficult to raise capital to start up a small business that will sustain him and his family. He plans to invest this loan in a transport business, by buying a motorbike for transporting people and goods from one place to another. He believes the business will succeed because the previous loan he took was repaid by the income raised from an old bike of his, therefore he concludes that he is sure the business will succeed. He is certain that this business will succeed because the roads around the area of residence are poor, therefore the bike is a paramount way of transportation. The loan will help his community because they will be able to afford a considerable means of transport at cheaper fares. \r\n\r\nAdolf will plough back his profit into his business and use part to care for his family. He also will use the proceeds to pay his children\u2019s school fees and cater for the family. He prefers GHAPE because of the training he frequently receives and the low cost in obtaining and paying back a loan.\r\n\r\nAbout GHAPE \r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon.  GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach.  Every client is trained in business management, basic health, life skills, financial management, profits and losses, and family values.  Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement.  GHAPE instils a sense of family and community within its clients and staff and has developed a strong bond of trust between the organization and its clients.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":614101,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Motorcycle

She is 52 years old. Cerila is married and has five school-aged children. To make a living, Cerila owns and operates a sari-sari (variety) retail shop. The main source of income for the business comes primarily from buying and selling daily-use products such as shampoo, soap, toothpaste, canned goods, instant noodles, and snack foods in the local community. Cerila has been engaged in her business for more than 10 years and earns approximately 6000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Cerila joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. Cerila has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to buy and sell. Cerila is requesting a new loan of 8000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional inventory and as working capital. This loan will be the second loan taken out by Cerila from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, we created this template for our field staff to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate

","en":"Manuel, age 54, lives in the village of Luis Vasquez in the San Pedro Sula municipality.  He has been married to his wife, Zulema, for 30 years.  She is a seamstress.  The couple has a 20 year old son and a 28 year old daughter.  The couple and their son contribute to the family expenses.\r\n\r\nManuel started as a paid helper in woodwork.  When he had the knowledge of how to work with the wood he decided to become independent in order to have better income for the family.  His family motivated him to become a contractor.  That way, with a lot of effort, he managed to have his own house.\r\n\r\nFrom his house Manuel makes carvings from all types of wood in order to make doors, closets, tables, and desks.  He also builds kitchen and bedroom furniture.  He also cuts molds for windows and doors.  He is an expert at his work because he has almost 35 years of experience.  He works ten hours a day laboring over his product.  He says that when there are blackouts he is not able to work.\r\n\r\nManuel has requested two loans from two previous cycles.  He has noted the improvements in the business, the increased stability, and the pride in his family.  Manuel has been able to offer better products and to build them more rapidly for his clientele.\r\n\r\nWith this loan for 20,000 lempiras Manuel will buy raw material to continue his work making wood products.\r\n\r\nIn the future he foresees renting a place to put his business in order to get more contracts.  That way he will continue to manage improvements for his family.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":913884,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Furniture

The girls are the oldest, and they, plus two of the boys, are in school.  The last one is not yet in school because he is not yet old enough.  But soon he will also be enrolled, as he will turn five years old this year.<p>\r\n<p>\r\n<b>Translated from Portuguese by Ilse Ackerman, Kiva volunteer<p><\/b>\r\n<p>\r\nAldevina e casada e mae de 5 filhos.

It is comprised of 13 hard-working members.  They are in their third cycle, and their expectation is to keep growing.  The women have been friends for a long time.  They work in different types of commercial activities like selling underwear, cosmetics by catalog, food, empanadas, and toys.  The men work in public transportation of passengers.  As far as competition goes, it does exist in the neighborhood.  The members always know how to get ahead with more effort and dedication to their work.\r\n\r\nThe loan is to get more merchandise and supplies for their different activities.  It is also to repair their vehicles by recovering the seats, buying replacement parts, and auto body repair.  This will help generate more income to improve the quality of life for their children and spouses.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva

He is married, 47 years old, and completed primary education. He has nine children between the ages of 24 and 4, eight of whom attend school. He lives in the Rubavu district in the West province. He works, and just received a loan from Amasezerano in order to renovate his home, which is not in good condition. He was able to build this home thanks to money he had previously saved, which also allowed him to pay school fees for his children. In the future, he would like to continue paying his loan in order to take care of his family needs.\r\n\r\n <br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Chloe Tuot, Kiva

business. She lives in Lapu-Lapu City, Cebu. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2004 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her fish vending business, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 30,000. Carmelita is borrowing PHP 22,000 to fund operations. This will be her 16th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 20,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Carmelita aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future wellbeing by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She is 44 years old, is married and has six children between 3 and 27 years old. Three of the children go to school. Maria finished second grade but did not have time to finish school because her father made her spend most of her time working on their farm. She lives in her own house.\r\n\r\nShe began a small business selling turnovers at the corners by the school, but with her husband's help she was able to get a stand at the Central Market where she sells basic goods like tomatoes, onions, carrots and rice. She has spent an average of 8,000 meticais on her purchases and has a profit of 3,000 meticais, which she uses for household expenses and construction. Maria also sells meals (soups) daily and earns 350 meticais. She also relies on her husband's help.\r\n\r\nThis is her third loan with Hluvuku. She is asking for 10,000 meticais to increase her inventory. The earlier loans were for 5,000 meticais and 15,000 meticais and were used for her business. She paid them off successfully and is confident that she will do the same on this loan so she can get more loans, as she would really like to help her daughter, who is currently unemployed."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":834901,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery

F. is a 31-year-old woman living in the town of Matautu Uta Lefaga.  She is married and has five school-aged children.  The main source of income from her crop-raising business comes from planting & harvesting bananas for sale.  Asoiva has been engaged in this business for over three years.\r\n\r\nAsoiva joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve  her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Asoiva has successfully repaid a previous loan from SPBD.  This previous loan was used to purchase harvesting equipment.  Asoiva is now requesting a new loan of $375 which will be used to purchase more harvesting equipment.  The loan will be the 4th loan taken out by the borrower from SPBD.  Asoiva plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family.\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD:\r\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva

They hope to earn an average monthly profit of 62,700 FCFA, which they will use to pay the interest on their loans, cover the expenses for their families' needs and they will invest the rest in their businesses. \r\n\r\nPlease note: In the photo their are only 5 women, as the sixth member of the group (called Awa C.) had gone to the hospital with one of her children.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Margot Bonner, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":450290,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"To purchase peanuts, beans and clothes for re-sale.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Koutiala","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:41Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alima ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tedi ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Djeneba ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kadia Solo ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mamou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Awa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-11-20T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":450000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":75000},{"due_date":"2010-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":75000},{"due_date":"2010-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":75000},{"due_date":"2010-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":75000},{"due_date":"2010-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":75000},{"due_date":"2010-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":75000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":166.66},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":166.66},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":333.33,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2010-01-19T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-23T10:13:19Z","rounded_local_amount":150482.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118152468},{"amount":166.67,"local_amount":75000,"processed_date":"2010-02-18T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-18T08:48:55Z","rounded_local_amount":75241.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123991307},{"amount":166.67,"local_amount":75000,"processed_date":"2010-03-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-18T08:32:41Z","rounded_local_amount":75241.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":129021582},{"amount":166.66,"local_amount":75000,"processed_date":"2010-04-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T12:15:23Z","rounded_local_amount":75241.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136746372},{"amount":166.67,"local_amount":75000,"processed_date":"2010-05-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T10:03:31Z","rounded_local_amount":75241.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144778913}],"funded_date":"2010-01-01T20:16:14Z","paid_date":"2010-06-15T10:03:31Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Margot Bonner","image":645826}},{"id":167016,"name":"Kahengye Group, Rukungiri","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"A.

Nowadays she lives with her small 4 year old son.  She works in agriculture, as passed on to her by her parents.  She grows potatoes and then sells them.  Her mother is a big support in all that she does and is always there to help her.  It's because of this that she is able to work in the fields.  During planting season and also during harvesting her mother is always there to help.  While she waits for the harvest, she has another business, which is selling used clothing in the city of Tacna.  She returns periodically to watch over her crops.

They live in a flood prone area in a former private hacienda. She is married to Mauricio and has four children: Virgilio\u2013 23 years old, an elementary graduate; Belinda\u2013 20 years old, a high school graduate; Estelita\u2013 19 years old, also a high school graduate and working as a domestic helper; and Marvin\u2013 15 years old, a high school undergraduate. Due to the lack of financial resources, they were not able to provide their children with higher levels of education and because some of her children lack the interest to study. \r\n\r\nFor 15 years, Leticia was able to maintain her village store through the help of her husband and the financial support of a microfinance institution. She hopes to engage in another type of business in the future and to be able to support her husband in his farming needs since they no longer have children to send to school. She knows that she must work hard in order to achieve her business plan someday and to avoid asking for credit from traders that offer large interests. With this, Leticia would like to borrow a loan of PHP 7,000 that she will invest for her store and farming needs.

It is a large neighborhood on the northern limit of Santo Domingo. The brand new Santo Domingo Metro (subway train) has a station right at the entrance of Guaricanos; however, modern improvements haven't reached many of our borrowers' homes. All services, especially water, are scarce. Finding employment is difficult, which is why many people, especially single mothers like Nereida P., find that they need to put their skills to work in order to support their families. Nereida is thirty-six years old and has two children. She didn't complete middle school, but went to beauty school and received a certificate in beauty culture. She set up a salon where she works alone. Peak days are Saturdays and Sundays. She explains that things are not easy lately. \"People come less often than before,\" she points out. Even so, she's been able to build a faithful clientele that will still come to get their hair done at least once a week. Nereida knows they pay not only for the service, they also pay to have HER provide the service. She will use this loan to buy specific hair products so that she can offer \"special services\" to her customers. When you wash hair with brand name products you can charge more, and Dominican women are willing to pay well to have their hair well taken care of.

This region is more than four hours from the city of Chiclayo which is the capital of the region of Lambayeque.\r\n<p>\r\nShe sells cosmetics from a catalog and works by request.  Her customers are her neighbors and acquaintances but she is always in search of new clients since the more orders she has, the more she earns from the company that provides her with the products.

He loves this business because, as he says, this serves as source of income of the family aside from farming.\r\n\r\nMost of Jerry's profits in the hog raising business has been invested in agricultural land that they are now planting with rice. Jerry still wants to expand his business. He is requesting a loan of PHP40,000 to buy two additional piglets and feed for the maintenance of his hogs. He hopes to gain higher income again for the future of his family. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":950,"image":{"id":897874,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy two additional piglets and feed for the maintenance of his hogs.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"San Bonifacio, Burgos, Isabela","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":123,"posted_date":"2011-11-03T01:50:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":950,"lender_count":4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jerry","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-09-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":40000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":950,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":40000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":950}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":427.5,"local_amount":18000,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T09:12:12Z","rounded_local_amount":18469.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250705326},{"amount":522.5,"local_amount":22000,"processed_date":"2012-02-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-16T07:41:17Z","rounded_local_amount":22574.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263495035}],"funded_date":"2011-11-03T10:22:52Z","paid_date":"2012-03-16T07:41:17Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tammea Arthur","image":1739710}},{"id":352043,"name":"Mary","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mary is a 32 year old married woman who has four children, three of whom are in school.

J. is married and has three minor children. She specializes in selling rice. Rice is the most important Tajiks food product, because it is used to prepare Tajiks plov (pilaf). To buy goods, Ochahon goes to a wholesale market that is held once a week in neighboring Kyrgyzstan. Ochahon then sells rice all the week in the central market.
