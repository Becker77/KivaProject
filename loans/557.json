Evangeline has been engaged in her business for over 10 years and earns approximately 10,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2005, Evangeline joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Evangeline is requesting a new loan of 25000 PHP, which will be used to pay for registration, franchise, and license fees. This loan will be the tenth loan taken out by Evangeline from ASKI.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Analiza has successfully repaid a previous loan of 3000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to to repair a transport vehicle used in the business. Analiza is requesting a new loan of 5000 PHP which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This loan will be the 2nd loan taken out by Analiza from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand the borrower's business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, we created this template for our field staff to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":125,"image":{"id":495770,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to invest in expanding the business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Gingoog City, Misamis Oriental","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":128,"posted_date":"2010-02-25T18:30:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":125,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Analiza","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-01-26T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":5000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2010-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2010-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2010-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2010-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2010-03-09T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2010-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2010-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2010-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2010-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2010-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2010-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2010-04-27T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2010-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2010-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2010-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2010-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2010-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2010-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":31.25,"local_amount":1250,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:23:57Z","rounded_local_amount":1443.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123928644},{"amount":31.25,"local_amount":1250,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:12:00Z","rounded_local_amount":1443.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128962694},{"amount":25,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:07:05Z","rounded_local_amount":1154.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136688983},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":1500,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:26:25Z","rounded_local_amount":1732.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144721816}],"funded_date":"2010-02-25T20:00:26Z","paid_date":"2010-06-15T09:26:25Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jacqueline Pittenger","image":278831}},{"id":184409,"name":"Edda Mar\u00eda","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Edda P. trabaja como Responsable de la Biblioteca P\u00fablica de Niquinohomo en el cual se gana un salario que le permite mantener a sus 2 hijos menores y as\u00ed poder pagarle el estudio a uno de ellos, es madre soltera y con mucho esfuerzo a logrado sacarlos adelante, ella se acerc\u00f3 a Ceprodel para solicitar un cr\u00e9dito y poder comprarles sus \u00fatiles escolares a su hija y el uniforme.","en":"Edda P. works as the administrator of the Niquinohomo Public Library, where she earns a salary that allows her to support her 2 young children and also pay school fees for one of them.

His amplifiers go to weddings, baptisms, and school parties.  The work Carlos Q. does is a bit self-sacrificing because he has to get up at dawn to gather his amplifiers.\r\n\r\nHe has three children, and they go to school.  But, on the week-ends they help their father.  His wife makes mattresses, and she sells them in the 16 de Julio zone.\r\n\r\nThe loan is to buy sound equipment.  The client has already worked with the institution in various cycles.  He will use this loan from the institution to buy amplifiers to improve the quality of sound.

Se siente feliz con su negocio; ya que no tiene  mucha competencia cercana,  y eso le favorece mucho en las ganancias. En adelante anhela instalar un restaurante en su casa. Este es su doceavo cr\u00e9dito con MFP, y se compromete en pagar todas sus cuotas a tiempo, ya que desea contar con posteriores ayudas. Con el cr\u00e9dito que solicita, podr\u00e1 comprarse una vitrina y sillas para implementar mejor su negocio. \n\n","en":"Mauricia, age 64, is divorced. She is a hard-working mother and lives in her own home with her 2 children and her grandchildren. For some years she sold candies at bus stops, but she had to stop because of the obstacles generated by her competition. Now, for 4 years she has prepared salchipapas (fried chicken and potatoes), a dish that she sells in the afternoons and that people like. She sells from the door of her home, which she does with great patience from 6:00 pm to 11:00 pm. She sells to her neighbours, who are regular customers and like her cleanliness and the flavour of her food. She is happy with her business; since there is not much competition nearby, her earnings are good. In the future she wants to open up a restaurant in her home. This is her twelfth loan with MFP, and she promises to repay all of her quotas on time, since she wants to have future help. With the loan that she is requesting, she will be able to purchase a display cabinet and chairs to better set up her business.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Christine Cooper, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":596709,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy display cabinets and chairs to set up her business ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-09-08T18:20:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":300,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mauricia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-08-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":800,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":119.42},{"due_date":"2010-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":125.84},{"due_date":"2010-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":128.76},{"due_date":"2010-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":136.25},{"due_date":"2011-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":141.94},{"due_date":"2011-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":147.79}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.78},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.19},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.29},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.09},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.23},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.42}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":38.6,"local_amount":102.93,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:25:37Z","rounded_local_amount":107.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172154608},{"amount":53.37,"local_amount":142.33,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T15:13:16Z","rounded_local_amount":149.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177449920},{"amount":48.29,"local_amount":128.76,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:00:36Z","rounded_local_amount":135.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182588619},{"amount":51.09,"local_amount":136.25,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T14:03:31Z","rounded_local_amount":142.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188725123},{"amount":53.23,"local_amount":141.94,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T04:40:49Z","rounded_local_amount":148.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191463219},{"amount":55.42,"local_amount":147.79,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T08:52:55Z","rounded_local_amount":155.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195886622}],"funded_date":"2010-09-09T01:49:49Z","paid_date":"2011-03-24T08:52:55Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Christine Cooper","image":1766620}},{"id":233571,"name":"Francisca","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Francisca es una se\u00f1ora de 58 a\u00f1os de edad, dedicada a la venta de tortillas, tamales y le\u00f1a, reside en San Francisco Gotera, Moraz\u00e1n donde vive junto a su madre y un nieto quienes dependen econ\u00f3micamente de ella.\nElla vende tortillas por la ma\u00f1ana y por la tarde, los tamales los vende tres veces por semana y la le\u00f1a pues todos los d\u00edas en su casa.\nHoy francisca solicita un pr\u00e9stamo para compra de productos para la preparaci\u00f3n de sus ventas como por ejemplo: Ma\u00edz, Le\u00f1a, pollo y verduras, Con este pr\u00e9stamo ella comprara mercader\u00eda para abastecer su inventario porque hay productos que al comprar por mayor cantidad los encuentra m\u00e1s baratos como el Ma\u00edz y la le\u00f1a que adem\u00e1s estos no se da\u00f1an, contribuyendo para que ella pueda obtener mejores ventas y ganancias para la alimentaci\u00f3n de la familia.\nEl objetivo de ella es poder darle a su nieto la educaci\u00f3n para que este se supere y pueda tener acceso a una mejor vida en el futuro.\n","en":"Francisca is a 58 year old lady who dedicates her time to the sale of tortillas, tamales [a local dish made from maize stuffed with meat or vegetables, and cooked in banana leaves] and firewood.

Muscovado is a type of unrefined brown sugar with a strong molasses flavor. Also known as \"Barbados sugar\" or \"moist sugar\", muscovado is very dark brown and slightly coarser and stickier than moist brown sugar. Muscovado takes its flavor and color from its source, sugar cane juice. It offers good resistance to high temperatures and has a reasonably long shelf life. It is commonly used in baking recipes and making whiskey. \r\n\r\nElizabeth has a simple dream in life which is to send her children to school until college and she believes that it is not too late to start again.

L. is from the village of Unidos. She is 59 years old. Mariquita is married and has two adult children. To make a living, Mariquita owns and operates a business venture in the agricultural sector raising livestock. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from raising chickens for sale. Mariquita has been engaged in her business for more than 10 years and earns approximately 8,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2002, Mariquita joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Mariquita has successfully repaid a previous loan of 20,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to to purchase livestock feed and other supplies. Mariquita is requesting a new loan of 20,000 PHP, which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This loan will be the 13th loan taken out by Mariquita from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

During the 56 years, her life was successful and intensive. This woman\u2019s life has many facets: she is a mother of five, a schoolteacher with many years of experience, and an experienced agricultural worker. All her children, aside from the youngest 24-year old son, have left the nest long time ago and now fly on their own. The youngest son together with his father, who works at the local tax collection agency of their town, take an active part in caring for the livestock. The Toktogul climate is auspicious for raising cattle. The family raises both  beef and dairy cattle. The unique local climate allows the family to drive their cattle to different pastures according to the season: in the spring from the  valley to the hills, and in the summer to the high mountain areas. \r\n\r\nNinakan believes that this business is profitable.

He is married and has 2 children aged 5 and 2. He has 2 additional dependents who live with him because they are his relatives from the village. In 1998, Daniel established his cooking utensils business. He began his business because he needed a permanent source of income to support his family. He discovered that cooking utensils were a big business opportunity in his community. \r\n\r\nWorking 7 days a week and 12 hours a day, he earns about Le 1,300,000 every month. He would like a loan of Le 5,000,000. Daniel has already received and successfully repaid 2 loans and now requires a new loan to buy more cooking utensils for his business.

Irene is 20 years old and lives in the town of Rukoki in the Fort Portal region of Uganda. For the past two years, Irene has been working hard to manage her small business, which makes clothes using a borrowed sewing machine. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Irene has requested a loan of 600,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy her own sewing machines and new material, and will help Irene to generate greater profits and pay medical expenses and take care of her family. Irene hopes that in the future she will be able to buy a plot of land and build a home. \r\n\r\nIrene is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills training. The ELA program has increased Irene's future prospects by helping her to learn more about womanhood and how to succeed financially.

district. She is 40 years old and has been blessed with three children. Two of her children are already married and live separately, while the other one now is working as a construction worker around the province. \r\n\r\nThy generates her income by cultivating rice and potato crops on the existing farmland.

The purchase of a dairy cow, made possible through a Kiva loan, is an investment that will repay itself many times over.  \n"}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1015924,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Milk Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buys cow","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NP","country":"Nepal","town":"SainbuBhaishepati","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"28 84","type":"point"}},"partner_id":62,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Parbati","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-03T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NPR","disbursal_amount":25000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2012-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2012-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2012-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2012-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2012-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2012-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2012-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2012-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2012-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2013-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2013-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.08},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.09},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.08},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.08},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.09},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.08},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.08},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.09},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.08},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.08},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.09},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.08}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":873658,"name":"Nancy","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Nancy is a 3-year-old married woman with two children, who are both in school.

With the money she is requesting she will buy chemical fertilizers for her flowers and vegetables.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Nina Delgado, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":322577,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy fertilizaers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-05-24T20:20:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":250,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gloria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-04-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":700,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":700}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":250}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":142.86,"local_amount":400,"processed_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:43:35Z","rounded_local_amount":435,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87080658},{"amount":107.14,"local_amount":300,"processed_date":"2009-10-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:14:11Z","rounded_local_amount":326.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96996787}],"funded_date":"2009-05-24T20:32:37Z","paid_date":"2009-11-16T03:14:11Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Nina Delgado","image":347326}},{"id":113919,"name":"Shuhrat","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"N. Shuhrat is 37 years old. He is married with 4 children. Shuhrat is dedicated to his agricultural business. Having little knowledge in the beginning, he had to learn a lot about farming. As of now, he has acquired fair experience in agriculture. Currently, Shuhrat is very happy and his 4 children are the motivation for his desire to grow his business. He approached IMON International to obtain a loan to buy more ingredients, including seeds and fertilizer to sow a good harvest to help him take care of his children and home.   \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Their ages range between 25 and 50 years. They have two to four children each. Their children's education levels range between elementary school through high school. One woman has been able to finance her child's university education. \r\n\r\nThis group proposed a loan of Rp. 11,000,000 and each member will receive Rp. 1,000,000. This loan will be used to buy piglets and pig food. The group is chaired by Ni Kade Citra Dewi. They hold monthly meetings to share information about their businesses, to collect savings and as a social gathering.\r\n\r\nNote to Kiva Lenders: This group uses a community lending model (commonly referred to as village banking) that is very common throughout Asia. In this model, a select number of group representatives will take out a large loan on behalf of their entire group (often an entire village). They will then distribute and manage the loan and collect repayments for the lender. This is a common and efficient practice in the region, but it makes reporting on Kiva somewhat unusual. Unlike most other loans, Kiva\u2019s partner MUK will be in contact primarily with the group representatives who in turn will be overseeing the end borrowers.  As such, journal updates likely will reflect the performance of the lending group rather than the individual end borrowers.

T. has a parcel of land in a community called La Labranza, 20 kilometers from the town of Condega. She works in agriculture, since the conditions and features of her farm are suitable for the cultivation of staple grains and irrigated crops.\r\nShe will use her financing to buy agricultural supplies--400 pounds of fertilizer and 400 pounds of urea--as well as to pay for labor, since these are the most expensive products she has to buy. She wants to buy them in order to enrich her crops and guarantee the harvest of the tomatoes she sows. At first, Do\u00f1a Esperanza del Carmen H. grew staple crops like beans and corn, but as her profits increased, she's invested in order to be able to grow irrigated crops. Those crops are more expensive but, since they're semi-technified, their harvests are more reliable. Up to this point she has put all her efforts into this business, since she lives in the country and it's the only work option she has in her area. She has made good progress, since at first she only grew staple crops like beans and corn during the rainy season, and now in addition to those crops she sows irrigated crops like tomatoes. By cultivating irrigated crops, she hopes to improve her business and be able to grow a wider variety of produce, using more technology to make her harvests more reliable. Do\u00f1a Esperanza depends on her family's help with the business. She is married and her husband works with her in the fields and sows the crops. Her three children also help her when they're not in school, since she and her husband have been teaching them about cultivating crops since they were very young. Do\u00f1a Esperanza has been working with Ceprodel for four years, during which time she's received five loans for the same purpose. \r\nThe difference these loans has made has been considerable and very important, since they've permitted her to improve her business and generate more income for her family, raising their standard of living or at least allowing them more decent living conditions.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Andrea Rosenberg, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":505491,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Purchase agricultural supplies: 400 pounds of fertilizer and 400 pounds of urea, plus manpower, for growing tomatoes","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Condega","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 -85","type":"point"}},"partner_id":74,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":300,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Esperanza Del Carmen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-06T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":6000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":6000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":300}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Andrea Rosenberg","image":603074}},{"id":188521,"name":"Mwatu","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mwatu is 36 years old and married with two children who go to school.

He owns a store called \u201cTienda El Patr\u00f3n\u201d that arose years ago when he needed to help his mother.  This is how he first called upon informal, high cost loans but as he gradually came out from under these debts he started to generate more profits and his business excited him.  He continued to work with 30 day loan providers, however.  \r\n\r\nToday, he wants to find better options for making cash purchases and this is why he\u2019s called on his Kiva loan which is the first loan he\u2019s made with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo and that he\u2019ll use to buy snacks, foodstuffs, beverages, candy and canned goods in larger amounts and paying cash which will insure better discounts that will lead to better profits on sales.\r\n\r\nHis dream for later on is to have a house of his own with space to install the store.  For this reason, while he works to reach it he continues to try to increase his profits which currently are no less than 30% and he continues to handle cash sales and exercise much prudence with the few loans he extends to his best customers.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":791866,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy snacks, foodstuffs, beverages, candy and canned goods in larger amounts and paying cash.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Soledad Atl\u00e0ntico","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2011-06-16T19:10:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":475,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Luis Alfonso","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-06-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":800000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":73340},{"due_date":"2011-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":74745},{"due_date":"2011-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":76178},{"due_date":"2011-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":77638},{"due_date":"2011-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":79126},{"due_date":"2011-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":80643},{"due_date":"2012-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":82188},{"due_date":"2012-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":83764},{"due_date":"2012-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":85369},{"due_date":"2012-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":87009}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.55},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.38},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.23},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.09},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.98},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.89},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.8},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.73},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.69},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.66}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":43.55,"local_amount":73340,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:49:35Z","rounded_local_amount":77162.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221673843},{"amount":44.38,"local_amount":74745,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-17T08:02:07Z","rounded_local_amount":78641.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227320400},{"amount":45.23,"local_amount":76178,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:07:15Z","rounded_local_amount":80148.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232803519},{"amount":46.09,"local_amount":77638,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:18:15Z","rounded_local_amount":81684.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238614606},{"amount":46.98,"local_amount":79126,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:59:01Z","rounded_local_amount":83250.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244568562},{"amount":47.89,"local_amount":80643,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:06:19Z","rounded_local_amount":84846.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250779903},{"amount":48.8,"local_amount":82188,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T10:19:40Z","rounded_local_amount":86472.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257188296},{"amount":49.73,"local_amount":83764,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:35:30Z","rounded_local_amount":88130.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263324525},{"amount":102.35,"local_amount":172378,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T09:31:16Z","rounded_local_amount":181363.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270038582}],"funded_date":"2011-06-21T13:37:51Z","paid_date":"2012-04-15T09:31:16Z","journal_totals":{"entries":4,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":311450,"name":"Mohamed","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Mohamed est un homme \u00e2g\u00e9 de 28 ans.

Pauline runs a small \"buy and sell\" stand in Mbengwi.  With this loan, she plans to invest in more products to sell at her stand.  Some of these products include rice, onions, groundnut oil, beans, tomatoes, salt, palm oil, and soya beans.  Her business plan shows she will invest 80,000 CFA (approximately $160 USD) of her own savings as well.\r\n\r\nThis will be Pauline's fourth loan from GHAPE; she has been a member since 2004.  She has been quite successful in the past with her buy-and-sell business due to her location on the main road, the variety of her products, and her reasonable prices.  She goes into Bamenda to purchase most of her products where they are much cheaper and sells them at her stall.  This saves many in her community the transportation costs and the time of going to Bamenda themselves to purchase these items.  She has a strong customer base and is confident that she will be able to increase her sales.  \r\n\r\nThe profits from this loan will be used for the school fees of Pauline's children.  One of her sons recently failed his exams and is required to redo the year, and she must pay an extra year of schooling for this child.  She also plans to purchase household items such as pots, knives, and dishes for her home.  Pauline does not foresee a problem with her loan repayments as they are quite small repayments every two weeks.  \r\n\r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon.  GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach.  Every client is trained in business management, basic health, life skills, financial management, profits and losses, and family values.  Clients are also required to contribute a small amount to a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement.  GHAPE instills a sense of family and community within its clients and staff and has developed a strong bond of trust between the organization and its clients."}},"status":"deleted","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":221552,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To purchase rice, onions, groundnuts, soya beans, salt, palm oil, garlic, and tomatoes for food stand.

She is a 38-year-old single mother of a 5-year-old girl who attends school. Rosa's business is selling sweets from her aunt's home. She studied to be a nursing technician, and practiced for a while, but it is a very difficult job. So, she began working in a cafeteria and enjoyed working there for three years. Currently, Rosa cleans houses and is building a shop in her home.\r\n\r\nRosa would like a loan for 2,400 Peruvian nuevos soles (US $750). She will use the money to build a shop, install flooring, and purchase sweets. With her savings and previous loans from Kiva's partner FINCA Peru, she has purchased shelving.\r\n\r\nRosa is grateful for her association with the community bank. She feels more secure because she has working capital, and watching other women take initiative in their businesses has increased her own enthusiasm. She knows that she has the opportunity to get ahead.\r\n\r\nRosa's dream is to one day sell gas canisters from her home.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Kris Vickery, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":272932,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To build a shop, install flooring, and purchase sweets","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":70,"posted_date":"2009-02-20T22:30:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":750,"lender_count":27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosa Violeta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-02-04T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2400,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2009-03-31T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2009-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2009-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":600}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":187.5},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":187.5},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":187.5},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":187.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":187.5,"local_amount":600,"processed_date":"2009-03-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T18:08:18Z","rounded_local_amount":606.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27089192},{"amount":187.5,"local_amount":600,"processed_date":"2009-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T18:17:12Z","rounded_local_amount":606.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27089193},{"amount":187.5,"local_amount":600,"processed_date":"2009-04-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T16:09:00Z","rounded_local_amount":606.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35982516},{"amount":187.5,"local_amount":600,"processed_date":"2009-05-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T22:54:19Z","rounded_local_amount":606.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44443033}],"funded_date":"2009-02-21T01:34:54Z","paid_date":"2009-06-15T22:54:19Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"k vickery","image":389145}},{"id":93455,"name":"Maria Esperanza","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La Se\u00f1ora Mar\u00eda Esperanza R. tiene 35 a\u00f1os, y su estado civil es casada.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <p>\r\n\t\r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous, and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment, forcing hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <p>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<p>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Julia has a stall at Pucallpa\u2019s massive Bellavista market where she sells chicken and different fruits, depending on the season. When I visited her recently in the late morning, she had already sold most of her chickens and had some peppers, plantains and oranges for sale.\r\n<p>\r\nJulia has been working with Manuela Ramos for two years and used her very first loan to fix up a house on her property so she could rent it out to tenants. At that time she had a business selling fruit juices but left that for her current enterprise at the Bellavista market, which she finds less strenuous. According to Julia, her loans from Manuela Ramos have helped her to maintain enough capital to keep her business going.\r\n<p>\r\nJulia plans to use this loan of 1500 soles to purchase 30 hens and to fix up her stand so that she can keep them there.  These hens are of a higher quality than the chickens she sells currently, so she hopes to be able to make a better profit with them.\r\n<p>\r\nJulia is a single mother of a five-year-old daughter. Her goal is to eventually have a business out of her home which would be easier for her daughter, who currently must rise every day before dawn to accompany her mother to the market. In this short video clip, Julia talks about the home-based business she would like to have eventually: a stationary and copy shop, which she thinks would do well due to the fact that there are many schools in her area.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":352411,"template_id":1},"video":{"id":844,"youtubeId":"jMm1qf0BF1c","title":"Kiva Entrepreneur Julia Teresa from  Peru","thumbnailImageId":352411},"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To buy 30 hens and fix up a market stall.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Pucallpa-Ucayali","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":72,"posted_date":"2009-07-19T23:50:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":500,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Julia Teresa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-07-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2009-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2009-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2009-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":375}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":125,"local_amount":375,"processed_date":"2009-08-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T18:43:54Z","rounded_local_amount":377.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73635442},{"amount":125,"local_amount":375,"processed_date":"2009-09-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T22:41:12Z","rounded_local_amount":377.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87074518},{"amount":125,"local_amount":375,"processed_date":"2009-10-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T01:56:12Z","rounded_local_amount":377.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96989857},{"amount":125,"local_amount":375,"processed_date":"2009-11-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:39:07Z","rounded_local_amount":377.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103834801}],"funded_date":"2009-07-20T02:49:04Z","paid_date":"2009-12-15T13:39:07Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Rose Vines","image":111942}},{"id":126223,"name":"Alec","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Alec is a 34-year-old single man.

She has eight children, but one passed away recently. Victoria raises pigs and cattle, but while in mourning, she wasn't always able to feed and care for her animals. Fortunately, time has helped to lessen her grief and she has returned to her work. She fattens pigs for six months, then takes them to be sold at a butcher shop in the city. When one of her cows has been bred, Victoria gets as much from the milk as she can. She makes delicious cheeses and sells them wholesale to merchants. Victoria loves her work; it has allowed her to provide all her children with an education. Her husband is a farmer, and together they're able to provide their household with all the necessities. This is Victoria's fourth loan with MFP; she's very content with her community bank and has never neglected her payments. Your contribution will help Victoria to purchase feed for her pigs. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Corinne Gilroy, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":392189,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Buying pig feed","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-09-22T04:10:15Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Victoria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-08-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-27T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":350}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":350,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2010-04-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:37:54Z","rounded_local_amount":1011.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136717290}],"funded_date":"2009-09-22T05:58:01Z","paid_date":"2010-05-15T11:37:54Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":142680,"name":"Cristina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Cristine is managing a general store for ten years.

This will be her 12th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 21,500, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom.

is a married woman who lives in Bais City, Negros Oriental. She earns her living by selling vegetables.  Her husband Hermoso, who is 56 years old, works as a vendor to earn his living and helps in his wife's business activities.  They have six children who are between 13 and 34 years old.  Visitacion joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2006 because she aspired for something better for her family.  With the help of her past eight loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Visitacion has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 19,500 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 7,000, thus uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her ninth loan, she is borrowing PHP 24,000 to purchase more stock to sell so that she can continue to save up for the future education of her children.  Visitacion is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

The idea of raising and reselling cattle was not unique or creative, because that\u2019s the major activity for all residents in a local area. The business was started 5 years ago with an initial capital of 4,000, and now it brings Akylai twice as much per month. Akylai gathered this group of entrepreneurs in order to purchase more cattle. The expected returns from the business can be spent on purchasing an automobile, a valuable gift for her husband. \r\n\r\n\r\n        --- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance (MBF), a young, ambitious and socially-focused Microfinance Institution in Kyrgyzstan. \r\nMBF is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development and upholds the triple bottom line \u2013 People (building human capital and taking care of its customers as well as society), Planet (keeping environmentally friendly) and Profit (earning revenue to expand autonomously).

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

old.  He lives in the town of Ijevan.  After completing military service, he got married and now has two children - a boy and a girl, both of whom attend a secondary school.  Samvel's wife is a homemaker.  Samvel has been leasing a shop since 1999, where he has been involved in processing wood.  He buys wood from the Ijevan forestry and uses it to make parquet flooring, box details, floor plinths and also fills private orders.  Samvel sells his products in Ijevan, Yerevan and also sells them to his loyal customers from Hoktemberyan and Echmiadzin districts.  Thanks to this business, Samvel is able to provide for his family.  He needs a loan in the sum of 900 000 dram to buy an inventory of wood and a woodworking machine.  This is Samvel's fourth loan from the Nor Horizon organization, and he has never been late on loan

With a loan of 2,000 Sol (US$643) approved by Manuela Ramos , Isabel  will purchase a greater volume of flowers, of better diversity, which she will take in from the capital of Lima and abroad from Ecuador, as well as accessories and preservatives to prepare the flower arrangements so she can better attend to her clients with her quality work. She is also considering purchasing clothing bundles to put on sale in her space at market. One of her daughters now helps her in the business and in the upkeep of their home.

Her eldest son is 15 years old and is in his 4th year of secondary school, and her youngest son who is 9 years old is in the 3rd grade in primary school. Her life partner works with his wife, and their purpose is to maintain the business active, as it is the most important source of income for the family, and is the means by which they have been able to provide for their sons. Amongst their wishes is to be able to carry out much needed home improvements so that the family can live better.  Due to the fact that she earns very little, Candida has not been able to realize the changes that she wishes for their home. Her dream is that her sons graduate and become professionals given that Candida has made many sacrifices so that her sons could carry out their studies, have clothing on their back, and a home. She also dreams that all people will learn to recycle so that we can preserve a clean planet. \r\n\r\nCandida\u2019s main economic activity is the collection of junk goods such as: iron, paper, copper, and aluminum. Candida has owned her business for 14 years and it is located in the home in which she lives. When Candida began her business it was with a small amount and with her own capital since she herself found the money to establish her business. It is a very difficult job due to the fact that she has to walk a lot until she has collected a sufficient quantity by pounds, she then takes it to her home, where the heavy collections of junk goods are later moved to recycling companies located in the different countries of Central America. This is a long process, her husband who supported her in this business venture later began working with her, and currently they both generate income for their family. Candida will use this loan as capital for her work since she has to pay for transportation costs, and the purchase of the paper to recycle, iron, and aluminum given that during the collection rounds that she carries out she does acquire a lot of material, and as such it is necessary for her to buy materials from other people who arrive to offer them at Candida\u2019s home. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Mariela Cedeno, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":259900,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Recycling","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"Business capital to cover transportation costs and the purchase of materials.

Her house is mostly made of wood, but she is planning on soon building the other part with sturdier material\u2014cement. When she was young, she used to work in agriculture alongside her parents, but she did not like that. Instead, she aimed to work as a fruit and vegetable vendor. As soon as she started her own family, she proposed the idea to her partner, who did not go along with it at first. However, Hermelinda persevered until she finally became a prosperous green grocer in her city. Her husband now helps her anytime time she has to visit the most distant farms in search of low prices to weigh and carry the banana bunches and oranges by the hundreds. She is a dynamic merchant who likes to get ahead by means of her labor. For this reason, she has invested her profits in home improvement and in providing an education for her children. Hermelinda motivates the other group members of the microfinance institute so that they can make their payments on time, setting the example herself and working responsibly.

At present, she sells baked peanuts and animal bones.\r\n\r\nP.\u2019s immediate goal is to go forward with her business and be able to increase her sales, but for this, she needs to invest in the purchase of raw materials, such as peanuts.\r\n\r\nThe other members of the group are Mrs. Xiomara Viche Gait\u00e1n, who is 25 years old and has a small grocery store; Karla Vanessa T., who is 27 years old and sells clothing, cosmetics, and holds raffles; and Mrs. Martina Concepci\u00f3n Viches, who is 34 years old and sells clothing. \r\n\r\nThis group has already had its first loan with Adim, which helped them increase their inventory of products and have more earnings.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Maria Isabela. She is 43 years old. Carmencita is the group leader of a seven-member group loan offered by ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is Carmencita R.'s Group.\r\n\r\nCarmencita is married and has four school-aged children. To make a living, Carmencita owns & operates a business manufacturing & selling clay products to local businesses and community members. Carmencita has been engaged in her business for over 10 years and earns approximately 6,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2005, Carmencita joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Carmencita has successfully repaid a previous loan of 4,000 PHP from ASKI. Carmencita is requesting a new loan of 15,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase materials needed in to manufacture her items. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay for the tuition fees for her children. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1775,"image":{"id":464039,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Manufacturing","sector":"Manufacturing","themes":null,"use":"To purchase materials needed in manufacturing ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Quinagabian, Sta.

She is the one raising her hand in the photo and is vice-president of the loan group Baraka Office. She is 42, a widow and mother of six children, all enrolled in school. Her eldest daughter is in the first year at university, and the others are in secondary or primary school. Her husband died after a long illness, around the year 2000, of HIV AIDS. \r\n\r\nEkanga L. lives in the Murara neighborhood, township of Karisimbi, and she has a charcoal depot in the Birere district. Moreover, in order to maximize her income, she also sells palm oil wholesale in the market of KIBABI. Ekanga L. began her business with her own funds around 2002, before the eruption of the Nyiragongo volcano, which completely destroyed the economic life of the town of Goma. She was selling fritters with a working capital of $12.50. And all this after her husband's death. \r\n\r\nIn view of her family responsibilities and living alone, she was just scraping by. However, in 2004, she received a first loan from the MFI Hekima. From then on, she was able to reestablish her social and economic equilibrium. Ekanga L. has already managed to achieve some family goals, notably the purchase of a plot of land. If God grants her long life, Ekanga L. intends to continue to be ambitious enough, despite being a widow, to build a house for her children. With the loan from Hekima, widow Ekanga L. hopes to grow her sales by buying 10 sacks of charcoal (for her charcoal business) and 5 barrels of oil (locally known as \u00abKafindondo\u00bb.) \r\n\r\nEkanga L. says that the major challenge to her charcoal business is the multiple attacks along the route carried out by outlaws who are hiding in the Virunga National Park, in the east of the DRC, and Rwandan Hutu rebels from the FDLR. Also the police and administrators make difficulties, especially since the State has threatened to bring to justice those they say are destroying the environment (people who sell wood from the national park). As for her oil sales business, she sometimes buys a load of spoiled oil or poor quality oil which has lost all its flavor, since this oil is produced by local artisans in the province of Kindu-Maniema and way up north near Lake Kivu, around Beni, or Mangina, and sometimes stored in dirty jerrycans or rubber containers that are fragile, etc. This can cause her an enormous loss. \r\n\r\nWidow Ekanga L. would like to thank the MFI Hekima for the loans that she receives without collateral since it is thanks to these loans that she is managing to support her orphaned children. The Baraka Office group is composed of eight women. \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Teresa Kramer, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2500,"image":{"id":548326,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Charcoal Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":["Conflict Zones"],"use":"10 sacks of charcoal and 5 barrels of oil (locally known as \u00abKafindondo\u00bb)","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CD","country":"Congo (Dem.

She is a very hard working, uncomplicated person. She lives in her own house together with her husband Alonso, 65, and their youngest son Antony, 20.  She wants to give her family a better quality of life. The fields that Celia works are the best kept fields in the village of Picoy. Every day she works the fields from very early in the morning and she knows that the care she gives to the plantations of potatoes and peas will directly impact on the income earned for her family. What she likes best about her work is the freedom that she feels as she travels among the green fields in her village. She has been an agriculturer for the past 10 years. The hardest part about her work is keeping insect pests out of the harvest. In time she hopes to purchase more land so that she can increase her yield.  This is her second loan with MFP (Kiva Field Partner). With the one thousand nuevos soles she is requesting she will invest in the purchase of fertilizer for the plantations. \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Erika Lindig, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":581407,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To purchase fertilizer.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-08-10T12:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Celia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-07-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":375}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":375,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:42:39Z","rounded_local_amount":1049.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211269260}],"funded_date":"2010-08-11T02:20:39Z","paid_date":"2011-06-15T11:42:39Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":225423,"name":"Rosa Elvira","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Rosa de 39 a\u00f1os, ella tiene una peque\u00f1a tienda en la parte delantera de su casa, vive en una zona periurbana en la Perimetral de Guayaquil. \n\nElla comenz\u00f3 con la tienda para poder mantener a sus tres hijos de 14, 12 y 3 a\u00f1os.

daughters.\r\n\r\nKadyrzhan was born into a large, simple farm family, and since childhood he helped his father on the farm.  After leaving school, Kadyrzhan went to driving school and got a job at his home collective farm driving cargo. In 1985 when he was 26 years old, Kadyrzhan married, and two years later his daughter was born. That same year the collective farm where he worked allocated to him a small plot of land in his home village where he constructed a house and sheds, and began a small farm. Over time, Kadyrzhan\u2019s family grew, as did their expenses.  His salary as a driver was no longer enough.  Kadyrzhan decided to devote all of his time to raising cattle.  In 2010 Kadyrzhan married off his eldest daughter, and to pay for a traditional wedding, he had to sell two milk cows and one calf. Now on his farm, Kadyrzhan has only one milk cow.  Consequently he is asking for a loan for 100,000 som (KGS) to buy a milk cow, sheep, and calves. Kadyrzhan plans to expand his barn and increase his livestock.\r\n\r\nBai-Tushum and Partners uses Kiva funding to target the especially vulnerable population.

She started with 100 PEN, and together with her husband they initiated their business.  The business is located at her home where they have a large orchard.  The space allows them to grate, sift, and dry the product before selling it.\r\n\r\nShe currently continues with the same business of selling starch, which is used to prepare regional sweets.  She has a client base.  She also works with bakeries and stores who place monthly and daily orders.\r\n\r\nWith this loan for 3,000 PEN she will buy one ton of yucca.  She will use part of the money to buy corrugated metal and plastic sheets.  These are the primary tools used to dry the starch in the sun, always being careful about hygiene and cleanliness.\r\n\r\nShe and her husband make the decisions about the earnings from the business.

Virgie is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the second loan taken out by Virgie from GDMPC.

Se dedica a la agricultura, siembra paltas y caf\u00e9; pero su cultivo preferido es el caf\u00e9, por ello con mucha alegr\u00eda y dedicaci\u00f3n cuida sus plantas, podando y quitando todos los arbustos para que se ramifiquen y desarrollen r\u00e1pidamente para que en menos de 9 meses ya pueda estar cosechando. Herminia vende su caf\u00e9 a una acopiadora llamada \u201cMina\u201d, la cual le compra toda su producci\u00f3n a un buen precio y sin enga\u00f1arla en el peso, como otros compradores. Para ello, debe transportar los sacos de su producto durante 2 horas en carro desde su chacra. Las ganancias que obtiene por su caf\u00e9 las usa para comprar vestimenta para sus hijos y otras necesidades de su hogar.\nEste es su segundo pr\u00e9stamo con MFP y manifiesta su agradecimiento a los integrantes de su banco comunal, quienes le permitieron ser parte de ellos y confiaron en su trabajo responsable. Con el dinero que ahora solicita quiere comprar un motocarro para poder trasladarse r\u00e1pidamente a las tierras de cultivo que tiene en zonas m\u00e1s alejadas, donde no pueden ingresar los autos.\n","en":"Herminia is 29 years old. She lives with her partner, the father of her 3 children, in a rented house. Her work is in agriculture; she cultivates both avocados and coffee, but her preferred crop is coffee. She tends her plants with great joy and dedication, pruning them and removing the brush so that they will branch properly and develop rapidly, providing a harvest in less than 9 months. Herminia sells her coffee to a wholesaler called \"Mina,\" which purchases all of her production at a good price and does not cheat her on the weight as some other buyers do. For this, she has to transport her products in sacks 2 hours by car from her farm. She uses the profits from her coffee to buy clothes for her children and other necessities for her home. \r\n\r\nThis is Herminia's second loan with MFP, and she expresses her gratitude to the members of her communal bank who have allowed her to join them and who have shown faith in her as a responsible worker. With the funds she is currently requesting, she will buy a motocarro (a 3-wheeled vehicle with cargo space in the back), so that she can move around quickly on her cultivated land, some of which is in isolated areas not accessible by car. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Patricia Linderman, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":402274,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Purchase of a motocarro (3-wheeled vehicle)","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Chanchamayo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.05 -75.316667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-10-08T17:00:24Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":525,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Herminia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-09-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":525}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":525,"local_amount":1500,"processed_date":"2010-05-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:39:15Z","rounded_local_amount":1512,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144751079}],"funded_date":"2009-10-08T21:28:39Z","paid_date":"2010-06-15T09:39:15Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Patricia Linderman","image":100107}},{"id":146837,"name":"Najjanakumbi J Namugamba Margaret Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"N.

She and her husband have two children, ages 17 and 15. Nicolasa is a dairy cow farmer. She uses the raw milk to make cheese, and then sells the cheese in the market. She learned dairy cow farming from her mother when she was a little girl.  Nicolasa and her family have a small home in Maica Norte, an area just outside of the city of Cochabamba.  This is where her six dairy cows are located.\r\n\r\nCurrently, Nicolasa's husband is working in Spain, so she has been taking care of the business herself. He has been sending his earnings back to the family, so she has been remodeling their home with the extra income. Recently, however, due to the economic crisis, he has not been able to contribute as much. Her oldest child is studying to become an auditor and she is in her second semester of studies.\r\n\r\nWith this loan from CIDRE, Nicolasa plans to purchase one more dairy cow. This will help her to increase her level of milk production incrementally.  Nicolasa's dream is for her husband to return from Spain that they can work together in Bolivia and they don't have to be separated anymore.

She is married to Orlando, who is 39, and with whom she has two children.  Together, they live in their own home, located in the central jungle.  For more than 6 years, she has grown coffee and plantains.  She does this with her husband, and they both have the goal of offering a better quality of life to their children.  She wakes up very early every morning to prepare breakfast for her children, and later goes off to her fields.  What she likes best is to weed her fields, however, having to place traps for the pests is very dangerous and difficult for her.  On the other hand, she realizes that this activity is very profitable, and thanks to this she has built her house. She lives a worry-free and comfortable life, and she can cover the costs of schooling for her children.  For this reason she would like to increase her production by purchasing more productive land, and she would like to concentrate on buying and selling plantains and wholesale and retail prices.  \r\n\r\nThis is her fifth loan with MFP, and she assures you that she is very enthused to continue working in her communal group, who have shown themselves to be responsible and honest.

She earns her living by operating two business ventures:  sari-sari (general) store and tricycle (public transport) operator businesses. Her husband Allan D. P., who is 26 years old, works as a tricycle driver to earn his living. They have 2 children who are 3 and 6 years old. \r\n\r\nMa. Rochel joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2006 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 13 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Ma. Rochel has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 24,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 12,000, thus uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 14th loan, she is borrowing PHP 27,000 which she intends to use as additional capital for her business so that she can continue to save up for the future education of her children and to purchase a parcel of land. \r\n\r\nMa. Rochel D. P. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed on a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Despite the rain, one could hear the unsurpassable laughter.  During the meeting, the group was interviewed.  The women told me that the majority works reselling used clothing and breeding animals.

The women are very satisfied with their credit and for that reason have been requesting a loan from the institution for more than three years.<p>\r\nThe women are not only grateful to Friendship Bridge for the financial help lent to them, but also for the educational assistance.  They told me that the information about women\u2019s preventive health and the use of herbal medicines provided by the Bacilia credit agency was very helpful.  Also, the women feel that the knowledge gained about women\u2019s rights and inter-family violence was very valuable for some members of the group.<p>\r\nPrograms like Friendship Bridge that offer easily accessible credit to clients who live in rural areas, in addition to education about health and women\u2019s rights, are important to the development of Guatemala.

Las mujeres han venido trabajando juntas desde hace ya muchos a\u00f1os y eso ayuda mucho a la consolidaci\u00f3n he integraci\u00f3n del grupo. \r\n\r\n<P>El desembolso se llev\u00f3 acabo durante una intensa, pero t\u00edpica, lluvia en el cant\u00f3n Maza. A pesar de la lluvia uno pod\u00eda escuchar las risas inigualables. Durante dicha reuni\u00f3n proced\u00ed a entrevistar al grupo. Las compa\u00f1eras me contaron que la gran mayor\u00eda de ellas trabaja en el negocio de reventa de ropa y la crianza de animales. Al parecer en esa \u00e1rea de Guatemala la crianza de toros, cerdos y pollos es M. rentable, especialmente en \u00e9pocas festivas. Las mujeres est\u00e1n M. contentas con su cr\u00e9dito, es por eso que han venido solicitando un pr\u00e9stamo a la instituci\u00f3n por m\u00e1s de tres a\u00f1os. \r\n\r\n<P>Las mujeres no solo est\u00e1n contentas con Friendship Bridge por el servicio financiero que se les presta, sino por el educacional tambi\u00e9n. Ellas me comentaron que las capacitaciones impartidas por la agente de cr\u00e9dito Bacilia, de salud preventiva de la mujer y la utilizaci\u00f3n de plantas medicinales fueron M. provechosas. Asimismo, las clientas consideraron que la capacitaci\u00f3n sobre derechos de la mujer y violencia intrafamiliar fue de mucho valor para algunas integrantes del grupo. \r\n\r\n<P>Programas como Friendship Bridge que otorgan cr\u00e9ditos c\u00f3modos a clientas que viven en \u00e1reas rurales y capacitaciones en salud y derechos de la mujer son M. importantes para el desarrollo de Guatemala. Esto se debe a que por muchos a\u00f1os los pobres, especialmente las mujeres, han sido marginalizados por el sistema y estas instituciones les brindan oportunidades para salir adelante. Por medio de Kiva t\u00fa tambi\u00e9n estas cooperando con el desarrollo del pa\u00eds contribuye a darles esta

Mart\u00ednez\r\n37 years old\r\nQ3665,- \/ $500\r\n\r\nThis is the story of a young woman who, just as so many others, struggles to find her way in life.  Perhaps more than for others, her work plays a major role in helping her find her life's direction.  This woman is called Lesbia and she lives in the Guatemalan City Prison called  Santa Teresa. <p>\r\n\r\nI get the opportunity to meet with Lesbia when I accompanied Sergio Roberto Gonzalez, the director of FAPE, on a special day organised by FAPE to teach the women how to run a business.  Entering the prison is relatively easy, and the two stamps on my arm ensure that I can rejoin the outside world.  Obviously for the women here, it is another story.  This facility is a place where most of the inmates await their trial.  The slow process of the courts means that some of them have been waiting for more than four years.  Sitting together in the prison's enclosed patio area, we begin our chat and Lesbia tells me that she has been there for four years and one month.<p>\r\n\r\nBefore she began her time in this facility, Lesbia was living in Guatemala City.  Her family is from a nearby area called San Miguel Pet\u00e1pa.  She is trained as a teacher and has a 20-year-old brother.  <p>\r\n\r\nIn prisons in Guatemala, like many other developing countries, authorities supply only the most basic essentials.   Beyond shelter, food and water, the standard of a prisoner's life depends on what their family can provide them with.  Items such as clothing, books, and toiletries are all given by the inmate's families.  Because Lesbia's mother is ill at the moment and cannot visit her, she has no one but herself to rely on.<p>\r\n\r\nLiving circumstances within the prison are far from easy.  The women live in a single room with 24 other inmates.  The beds are made out of concrete.  In order to give a semblance of privacy, the prisoners hang sheets between adjacent beds giving each woman has a solitary square metre of her own.  Currently there are about 225 people live in the facility.<p>\r\n\r\nLast year, students from the University Rafael Landivar (URL) came to the prison and to teach interested inmates how to run a small business.   There were courses given in all kinds of business related subjects, such as credit control, writing a business plan, etc. Inspired by the course, Lesbia decided to make all kinds of small decorative items for books and pens by hand.  These charming products gave an outlet to Lesbia's talents and a focus to her life while incarcerated.  But it has become more than that now.<p>\r\n\r\nThe course organisers successfully petitioned the facility to allow inmates that performed very well in the course the chance to sell their wares at a market stall in the university for a day.  Lesbia was one of those chosen.  She tells me with pride how she was able to sell all of her goods, and that it proved to her how well her business could perform in the outside world.  The experience has inspired her to pursue her entrepreneurial dream and more than just a distraction from her mundane existence in jail.<p>\r\n\r\nIn the picture, Lesbia is holding a big bag of her products that she hopes to sell at a local church.  I am amazed when she mentions to me that it has taken her only two days to produce so many items.  There's nothing else to do in prison, she admits; there are no books, no televisions, and so days are very long there.  She focuses her entire life upon her business.  In order to work in the evening times, Lesbia had to seek special permission for the use of a lamp.  She's even allowed to own a scissors, a necessary item for her work.  Privileges like these are only available to women that show that they are dedicated entrepreneurs and participate in all of the offered social programs.<p>\r\n\r\nLesbia initially sold her products to friends that came to visit her in jail.  However, since the facility recognises Lesbia's responsible behaviour, they now approve her non-family visitors more readily.  This has proved very useful, as Lesbia is now able to use these visits to send out her products to clients as well as to receive materials.  Many of her suppliers she has never met in person, only over the phone.  It is certainly a challenge to run her business from this facility, but she is able to manage.<p>\r\n\r\nBefore her business, Lesbia didn't believe that she was very creative. Now, however, she actively seeks out inspiration for new product designs wherever she can.  Some of these designs shall be part of the new selection of products that she hopes will be ready in time for Christmas.  Lesbia realises very well that her customers like her products, but in order to maintain their interest, she needs to offer them something new and keep her products fresh.   A brilliant commercial thinker, if you ask me.<p>\r\n\r\nI ask Lesbia if there is something that she wants me to write in her story, and she tells me that she wants to thank FAPE for giving her this life-changing opportunity.  She tells me how she knows that funding women in prison may have been seen as a risky investment and that FAPE was the only organisation who thought it worthwhile.  Having FAPE believe in them has given her back a large part of her dignity and self esteem.<p>\r\n\r\nTowards the end of our interview, when I ask Lesbia about what her dreams are, she becomes a little emotional.  She explains to me how being in prison can change a person's way of thinking.  She feels that she has grown, spiritually and as a person.  Her biggest wish now is to be able to have a little shop somewhere in the city where she can sell not only her own products, but also the products of people that find themselves in situations similar to the ones that she herself faced.  Her experiences have taught her much about herself, she tells me, and she hopes that the lessons that she has learned she will be able to teach to others. This is what she is working for now: the new life she wants to build after prison and the credit will help her with this!"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":202188,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Souvenir Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To buy materails for making handicrafts.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GT","country":"Guatemala","town":"Guatemala","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15.5 -90.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":97,"posted_date":"2008-10-04T20:50:21Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":500,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lesbia Elvira","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-10-18T22:22:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GTQ","disbursal_amount":3665.96,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":407.33},{"due_date":"2008-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":407.33},{"due_date":"2009-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":407.33},{"due_date":"2009-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":407.33},{"due_date":"2009-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":407.33},{"due_date":"2009-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":407.33},{"due_date":"2009-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":407.33},{"due_date":"2009-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":407.33},{"due_date":"2009-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":407.32}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":55.56},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":55.56},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":55.56},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":55.56},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":55.56},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.56},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.56},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.56},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.52}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":55.56,"local_amount":407.33,"processed_date":"2008-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-16T03:13:36Z","rounded_local_amount":420.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5313259},{"amount":55.56,"local_amount":407.33,"processed_date":"2009-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T08:14:49Z","rounded_local_amount":420.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20395025},{"amount":166.67,"local_amount":1221.99,"processed_date":"2009-03-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T18:00:12Z","rounded_local_amount":1262.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27086824},{"amount":29.89,"local_amount":219.12,"processed_date":"2009-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-26T08:48:58Z","rounded_local_amount":226.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73594379},{"amount":192.32,"local_amount":1410.19,"processed_date":"2009-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-23T09:04:40Z","rounded_local_amount":1456.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96942028}],"funded_date":"2008-10-04T22:22:00Z","paid_date":"2009-12-23T09:04:40Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":68925,"name":"Stumai","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mambo from Tanzania! This is 50-year-old Stumai M. from Dar es Salaam. She is married with five children between the ages of 20 years and 30 years old. Stumai has been running a charcoal business since 2003.

Stumai normally buys charcoal from those who produce it wholesale, and she then sells it to customers around her area. Her business is doing very well. She works at the business for nine hours per day, seven days per week; she is assisted by one employee. Stumai currently earns about 500 USD from this business. She is requesting a loan of 850 USD in order to purchase additional stock of charcoal. In the future, she plans to expand her business.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women and uses the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets; thus they are deemed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro-leasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":850,"image":{"id":212169,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Charcoal Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To purchase charcoal in bulk","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Dar es Salaam","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-6.8 39.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-10-16T20:30:44Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":850,"lender_count":26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Stumai","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-10-31T14:18:50Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":1000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2008-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-01-31T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-03-31T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-08-31T07:00:00Z","amount":100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":85},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":85},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":85},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":85},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":85},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":85,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2008-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T04:21:54Z","rounded_local_amount":101150,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5348051},{"amount":85,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2008-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-17T09:15:37Z","rounded_local_amount":101150,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9970634},{"amount":85,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:17:25Z","rounded_local_amount":101150,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14886851},{"amount":85,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:04:24Z","rounded_local_amount":101150,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20436111},{"amount":85,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:57:54Z","rounded_local_amount":101150,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130384},{"amount":85,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:27:30Z","rounded_local_amount":101150,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027193},{"amount":85,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:16:36Z","rounded_local_amount":101150,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613233},{"amount":85,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:03:30Z","rounded_local_amount":101150,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010316},{"amount":85,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:42:24Z","rounded_local_amount":101150,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63232627},{"amount":85,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:56:14Z","rounded_local_amount":101150,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73664443}],"funded_date":"2008-10-17T14:18:50Z","paid_date":"2009-09-15T21:56:14Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jason Groce","image":null}},{"id":73023,"name":"Felicia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"  Felicia sells drinks and pure water and makes popcorn; she has been in this business for the past 3 years.

He has six children: one is married and lives separately; two work in Phnom Penh, a city in Cambodia; and the rest are attending school. S. is married to Dy, 45, who earns a living by selling junk food through the commune. S. has been a motor taxi driver since 1990. He is known for being a very innocent person and a struggling father. He gets up early every morning to take his customers to work and he takes them back in the late afternoon. He has a net income of $5 per day.

He lives with his parents and his four siblings in the rural Costa Rican community of Mollejones de Platanares, P\u00e9rez Zeled\u00f3n.  Mollejones is a community located 150 kilometers south of the province of San Jos\u00e9, the capital of Costa Rica, and is 850 meters above sea level.  In this area, people grow vegetables, coffee, and also carry out activities related to raising livestock and pigs.  There also exist several projects related to organic farming and hydroponics (a technique of growing plants, without soil, in nutrient-rich water).  In addition to the agricultural pursuits of the area, there are also auto repair shops, a supermarket, small restaurants (sodas) and a furniture store.  \r\n\r\nJuan Pablo works as an officer for the State Police force; he comments that his work is very far from his home, and it is difficult for him to travel there as the roads are in disrepair and there is little access to public transportation.\r\n\r\nFor this reason, Juan has decided to buy a motorcycle in order to be able to travel to work.  It will also help him save time and money.  He needs a loan of 300,000 Costa Rican colones ($550USD) to buy a motorcyle.  Having his own vehicle as his primary mode of transportation will allow him to continue to progress.\r\n\r\nJuan Pablo is part of the Empresa de Cr\u00e9dito Comunal de Bancruce, one of the 100 member organizations of EDESA in Costa Rica.  This will be his first loan but Juan Pablo stresses that, thanks to these types of organizations and credit facilitators, he can dedicate more time to activities that are productive. \r\n\r\n<br

Actualmente los negocios de cada una de ellas van prosperando pero requieren de mayor inversi\u00f3n de capital con el que  no cuentan, es por esta raz\u00f3n que han decidido renovar su pr\u00e9stamo y seguir adelante.\n\nLa coordinadora del grupo es la se\u00f1ora Paula del Carmen Rodr\u00edguez de 38 a\u00f1os de edad  que desde hace cuatro a\u00f1os empez\u00f3 vendiendo productos de belleza de la marca Avon en una empresa  en la cual trabajaba; para as\u00ed poder ayudarse en la manutenci\u00f3n de sus cuatro hijos de las edades 13, 17, 18 y 20 a\u00f1os respectivamente.\n\n El negocio  con el pasar del tiempo  y con los cr\u00e9ditos que le brindo adim  fue creciendo de tal manera  que ella es distribuidora de  sus productos.

They come from the Cofrad\u00eda region, a remote rural area of Nindiri.\r\n\r\nThis group has several loan cycles with ADIM which little by little has helped them improve their businesses and their quality of life. Today each of their businesses are prospering but they need an inversion of capital that they don\u2019t have, so they have decided to renew their loan and continue forward.\r\n\r\nThe coordinator of the group is 38 year old Paula del Carmen Rodr\u00edguez who has been selling Avon beauty products for 4 years in a business where she used to work. She sells so she can help support her four children ages 13, 17, 18, and 20.\r\n\r\nOver time and with the loans provided by ADIM the business has grown so much that she is a distributor of her products. Her other colleague is Mar\u00eda del Rosario G. who also sells cosmetics but of another brand more widely sold including shampoo, deodorant, moisturizers, makeup, coloring and more. This woman has 5 children, 4 of which still depend upon her and are ages 17, 15, 11, and 9 years old.\r\n\r\nThe other member of the group is Mar\u00eda F\u00e9lix Hern\u00e1ndez P., mother of 4 children ages 2, 9, 20, and 22 years old for whom she would make any sacrifice. She sells traditional desserts such as baked goods (milk cake, pastries), caramel (milk caramel, coconut, peanut), and pozol (a corn masa drink). This type of work requires great effort and investment because of the ingredients such as milk, sweetener, wood, fruit, corn, curd and for the difficulty in their preparation.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Cindy Kendall, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":361949,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Buy products such as makeup, shampoo, moisturizers, perfume, etc. ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 -85","type":"point"}},"partner_id":120,"posted_date":"2009-07-31T01:50:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":575,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda F\u00e9lix  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Del Rosario","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Paula Del Carmen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-07-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":11500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1150},{"due_date":"2009-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":1150},{"due_date":"2009-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1150},{"due_date":"2009-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1150},{"due_date":"2009-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":1150},{"due_date":"2009-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":1150},{"due_date":"2009-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":1150},{"due_date":"2009-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":1150},{"due_date":"2009-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":1150},{"due_date":"2009-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":1150}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.5},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.5},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.5},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.5},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.5},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.5},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.5},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.5},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.5},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":57.5,"local_amount":1150,"processed_date":"2009-08-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T09:32:48Z","rounded_local_amount":1173.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73532161},{"amount":57.5,"local_amount":1150,"processed_date":"2009-08-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T09:33:46Z","rounded_local_amount":1173.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73532162},{"amount":235.44,"local_amount":4708.76,"processed_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T09:40:42Z","rounded_local_amount":4806.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":86963651},{"amount":106.82,"local_amount":2136.48,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-19T08:51:45Z","rounded_local_amount":2180.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103711907},{"amount":60.24,"local_amount":1204.76,"processed_date":"2009-12-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T10:52:20Z","rounded_local_amount":1229.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110599593},{"amount":57.5,"local_amount":1150,"processed_date":"2009-12-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T10:53:05Z","rounded_local_amount":1173.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110599594}],"funded_date":"2009-08-03T12:55:25Z","paid_date":"2010-01-15T10:53:05Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Cindy Kendall","image":797722}},{"id":130381,"name":"Houda","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Houda has been working as a hairdresser.

She is 39 years old. Myrna is the group leader of a five-member group loan offered by ASKI, a Kiva partner. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is Sta. Cruz Center.\r\n\r\nMyrna is married and has five school-aged children. To make a living, Myrna raises livestock. The main source of income for the business comes from raising pigs to sell. Myrna has been engaged in her business for over three years and earns approximately 5,000 Philippine pesos a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Myrna joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Myrna is requesting a new loan of 7,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase baby livestock to raise and sell in the future. This will be the first loan taken out by Myrna from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay the tuition fees of her children. \r\n\r\n<b>About ASKI:<\/b>\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful micro-finance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

She is 34 years old and married with three school-aged children. To make a living, Danilon Marina raises pigs for sale. Danilon Marina has been engaged in her business for over three years and earns approximately $68 a month from this activity.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Danilon Marina joined the Kiva field partner, ASKI, to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation by engaging in business activities. Danilon Marina has successfully repaid a previous loan of 15,000 PHP from ASKI. She is requesting a new loan of 20,000 PHP which will be used to purchase livestock feed and other supplies. This will be her 4th loan from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated to improve her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful micro-finance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva

He lives in the town of Quimbiri on the edge of the jungle, where he has his own house.\r\n<p>\r\nHis family works in the carpentry business, specifically making furniture.  This is why since he was young, the sound of the machines and the smell of the wood has been etched in his memory.  He is has been in the same business for almost 38 years and works from 6am to 8pm.  Maurino likes his job very much, since it provides him with good earnings.  He makes traditional and contemporary furniture and he knows that diversification is the key to good sales.  In the future, he hopes to expand the space in which he works to store his raw material, finished work, and to purchase new machines.\r\n<p>\r\nThis is his third loan with MFP and he promises to continue making his scheduled payments on time.

After two years of this, she has decided to, along with her accessories, to sell articles of clothing for women, as well as purses and shoes.  With the loan provided by Fundaci\u00f3n Paraguaya, she will formally open her boutique.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Shaun Haines, Kiva
