It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a Php5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. Arlene earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of Php 400 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php 15,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nVictoria hopes to be able to expand further soon, just as she hopes to purchase some material needs for herself and her family. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay Micro Finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":714464,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

As a young father, he was responsible, along his wife and eight-year-old child, for the future of this business. Not too long ago things were going very well, both with his family and business. Unfortunately his loving wife became ill. This grieved him, but at the same time it gave him strength to continue sacrificing to gain money to cover the costs of his wife's medical bills so that she would recover quickly. David would like to take advantage of the large expanse of property that he inherited from his parents.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":271589,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, Tajikistan is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture, and Central Asian traditions. \r\n\r\nTajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She has been selling cakes and pizza for 5 years in a rented office space in downtown Tarma.

Celia has a specialist on her team who prepares and decorates the cakes and pizzas, paying attention to the smallest details and using the highest-quality ingredients for customer satisfaction. Two young ladies are in charge of selling her baked goods. The profits earned from this business allow her to pay both the monthly rent for her business space and her personnel\u2019s salaries.

income to support her five children alone.\r\n\r\nTogether with her husband (pictured), Makhfurat is devoted to the raising of animals, especially cows which she buys and sells in her local market. In this manner, she obtains the income that she needs.\r\n\r\nIn order to increase her income and revitalize her business, Makhfurat is requesting a loan of 4300 Somoni for the term of 6 months for purchasing young cattle. This purchase will enable her to increase her sales, to earn more, and to meet the needs of her children. \r\n\r\n\r\n<b>More about Tajikistan and IMON International<\/b>\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is married and has six school-aged children. To make a living, Jessica runs a business buying and selling rice by the kilogram in the local community. Jessica has been engaged in her business for over three years and earns approximately 10,000 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Jessica joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Jessica has successfully repaid a previous loan of 11,000 PHP from HSPFI which she used to purchase additional inventory and as working capital. Jessica is requesting a new loan of 14,000 PHP to purchase additional rice to sell. This will be her fourth loan from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated to improve and expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI: HSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2006 and has improved her living conditions with the help of loans from NWTF, and through her own efforts. By working hard in her businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 5,000. Delfina is now borrowing PHP 12,000 to fund the operations of her business. This will be her sixth loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 12,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Delfina aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future wellbeing by following the Dungganon way.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

The associates have various businesses such as selling groceries, fruits, vegetables, fish, sodas and other drinks, taxi driving, growing vegetables, and raising animals.<P>\r\nEvery associate has a different history they can tell, such as Maria, who started her business one year ago selling a few products.  With a loan from her community bank she was able to further develop her business.  Today, her store has grown significantly and has many customers.<P>\r\nOn the other hand, Ligia Perlita has been selling cebiche, a traditional dish maD. from raw marinated fish, for the past five years.  She mentioned that with her loan she would be able to improve her business and prepare more cebiche.<P>\r\nThe associates are requesting loans of different sizes; many only need 300, 450, 500, and 900 soles (3 soles = $1) making a total of 7, 050 soles in loans from the community bank.  <P>\r\nThey will invest these loans in buying roosters, medicinal herbs, oranges, lemons, bananas, and to buy tables and chairs for the \u201ccebicheria\u201d--a caf\u00e9 where they serve cebiche.<P>\r\nThey plan to use their savings to make sure their children are able to continue school, to increase the capital available for their businesses, and some even to build a house.<P>\r\nMany dream of owning their own house, or having a car to transport their products, and that their children will study and be able to become professionals."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2425,"image":{"id":115677,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"invest in and expand their various businesses","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":70,"posted_date":"2008-01-22T19:15:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2425,"lender_count":82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Zenobia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ivan","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Delfina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yovana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nancy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Delia Dionisia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Agustina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fredy","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Zenaida","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dionicia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Pepe Walter","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alicia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Felicitas","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Justina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ligia Perlita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-02-06T03:14:54Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":7050,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":2425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":1175},{"due_date":"2008-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1175},{"due_date":"2008-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1175},{"due_date":"2008-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1175},{"due_date":"2008-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1175},{"due_date":"2008-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1175}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":404.17},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":404.17},{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":404.17},{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":404.17},{"due_date":"2008-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":404.17},{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":404.15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":405,"local_amount":1177.42,"processed_date":"2008-03-06T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-06T09:31:33Z","rounded_local_amount":1186.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151441},{"amount":405,"local_amount":1177.42,"processed_date":"2008-04-06T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-06T09:31:33Z","rounded_local_amount":1186.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":175436},{"amount":405,"local_amount":1177.42,"processed_date":"2008-05-06T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-06T09:31:33Z","rounded_local_amount":1186.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":202711},{"amount":405,"local_amount":1177.42,"processed_date":"2008-06-06T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-06T09:31:33Z","rounded_local_amount":1186.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":229962},{"amount":405,"local_amount":1177.42,"processed_date":"2008-07-06T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-06T09:31:33Z","rounded_local_amount":1186.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":259043},{"amount":400,"local_amount":1162.89,"processed_date":"2008-08-06T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-06T09:31:33Z","rounded_local_amount":1171.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287793}],"funded_date":"2008-01-23T03:14:54Z","paid_date":"2008-08-06T09:16:14Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":35780,"name":"Bagulete I B Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jane M. is a 30-year-old mother of five young children.

Fernando","description":{"languages":["pt"],"texts":{"pt":"Enosse is 41 years old and he is from the province of Inhambane. Currently, he lives in Namaacha, a village in the province of Maputo which borders Swaziland. Enosse is married and is the father of 2 children -- both are students, the oldest is 13 years old and the youngest is 10 years old. \r\n\r\nEnosse lives in his own home with his wife, children, a cousin and a nephew.  In 1987, he left the province of Inhambe for Maputo to look for work. There, he worked for a company that closed down after two years. Six months later another investor decided to reopen the company and rehired some of the previous employees including Enosse. He took the job because at that time he still had not found employment anywhere else. This business also failed after three years but this time the employees received a severance reward payment. With this reward money Enosse purchased a vehicle and started a chicken raising business. For four years Enosse would raise the chickls for 21 days and then sell them to slaughter houses. However, with the increase in the price of the feed, he decided to let go of that venture and keep his passengers transportation business only, which he achieved by using the vehicle he bought with severance reward. In 2004, he went back into the chicken raising business since prices were once again affordable. Nowadays, Enosse raises at least 400 chicks at a time. According to him the best results come from selling the chicken already slaughtered. He has been selling about 150 chickens every month to the Financial Department of the Namaacha District. The sale of live chickens is also lucrative. Enosse has generated a monthly income between MTN 3,000 and MTn 4,000 but he has not been able to save much due to high family expenses. \r\n\r\nThis will be the second loan Enosse requests from Hluvuku and his fisrt through Kiva. With the first loan of MTn 7,000, Enosse purchased chicks and improved his business. This time, Enosse wants to apply the MTN 10,000 to purchase more chicks so that he can increase his flock and, therefore, profits. He will also fix the fencing which is old and need repairs.\r\n\r\nIn the future Enosse wants to increase his chicken raising ability, purchase additional hens and buy a new vehicle to help transport and sell the chickens. His biggest dream, however, is to see his children graduate from college. \r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Portuguese by Bertolt Cantalice, Kiva Volunteer<\/p> \r\n\r\nEnosse tem 41 anos de idade e \u00e9 natural da prov\u00edncia de  Inhambane. Atualmente reside em Namaacha, uma vila na prov\u00edncia de Maputo que faz fronteira com a Swazilandia. Enosse \u00e9 casado e pai de 2 filhos, ambos estudantes sendo o maior com 13 anos e ca\u00e7ula com 10 anos de idade.\r\n\r\nEnosse vive na pr\u00f3pria casa juntos com a sua esposa, seus filhos, um primo e uma sobrinha. Em 1987 saiu da prov\u00edncia de Inhambane para Maputo a procura de emprego onde come\u00e7a a trabalhar numa empresa que dois anos depois faliu. Assim seis meses depois houve outro empres\u00e1rio que decide abrir e chamar os antigos trabalhadores e ele foi um deles, j\u00e1 que n\u00e3o tinha arranjado ainda outro emprego. Este negocio tamb\u00e9m fechou 3 anos depois, mas desta vez indenizou os trabalhadores. Com o valor desta indeniza\u00e7\u00e3o Enosse comprou uma viatura e come\u00e7ou tamb\u00e9m com o negocio de cria\u00e7\u00e3o de frangos de corte. Por quatro anos Enosse criava os frangos por 21 dias e vendia para outros criadores fazerem o abate. Porem, com a r\u00e1pida eleva\u00e7\u00e3o dos pre\u00e7os da ra\u00e7\u00e3o, decide abandonar o negocio de cria\u00e7\u00e3o de pintos e focar somente no transporte semi-coletivo de passageiro usando a viatura comprada pelo valor da indeniza\u00e7\u00e3o. Em 2004 decide voltar com a cria\u00e7\u00e3o de frangos dado que os pre\u00e7os j\u00e1 estavam mais acess\u00edveis. Enosse cria atualmente no m\u00ednimo 400 frangos de uma s\u00f3 vez. O melhor negocio segundo Enosse \u00e9 vender j\u00e1 o frango abatido: tem vendido uns 150 frangos por m\u00eas para o Departamento de Finan\u00e7as do Distrito de Namaacha. Porem a venda de frangos vivos tamb\u00e9m \u00e9 lucrativa. Enosse tem tido um rendimento mensal entre MTn 3,000 e MTn 4,000 e n\u00e3o consegue poupar muito devido as despesas familiares.\r\n\r\nEste ser\u00e1 o segundo empr\u00e9stimo de Enosse com a Hluvuku, porem o primeiro com o Kiva. Com o primeiro empr\u00e9stimo de MTn 7,000 Enosse comprou pintos e melhorou o seu negocio. Agora Enosse pretende usar os MTn 10,000 para novamente comprar pintos, aumentando a cria\u00e7\u00e3o e os lucros. Assim conseguira reabilitar as capoeiras que j\u00e1 s\u00e3o antigas e precisam de reparos. \r\n\r\nNo futuro Enosse gostaria de aumentar a sua cria\u00e7\u00e3o de pintos, come\u00e7ar a criar poedeiras e comprar uma nova viatura para facilitar as vendas dos frangos. Seu maior sonho, porem, \u00e9 ver um dia seus filhos formados na universidade."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":169990,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Purchase

After having correctly repaid the three preceding loans, they are now on their fourth farm loan.  \r\n\r\nThe current loan will be used to buy a sufficient quantity of seeds for planting rice and peanuts, some minor supplies and equipment, and fertilizers and such, for farming.  Supplies are gotten at the marketplaces of Zansoni, M\u2019pessoba, and Fonfona.  Following the off-season, the crops are stored for a certain time, so that they gain in value.  Then the crops are sold retail and wholesale in cash transactions at the M\u2019pessoba and Koutiala markets.  Their customers come generally from large cities.  \r\n\r\nAfter selling their produce, the group members each intend to realize a profit of 65,000 francs CFA that will be used to repay the loan and to cover common family expenses.  \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":330777,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"To buy fertilizers, seeds, and minor supplies and equipment","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Koutiala","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:24Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1200,"lender_count":38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Koro Yssouf","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mamin\u00e8 Aly ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mamin\u00e8 ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mariam S\u00e9kou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mariam Yaya  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Chata Yamoussa  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Diaratou Zanga ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kadiatou Noumougolo ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatoumata Nianz\u00e9 ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-05-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":550000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":1200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":550000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1200}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":1200,"local_amount":550000,"processed_date":"2010-03-07T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:59:49Z","rounded_local_amount":555661.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":129021272}],"funded_date":"2009-07-13T18:44:20Z","paid_date":"2010-04-15T09:59:49Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Daniel Kuey","image":669418}},{"id":117723,"name":"Rebecca","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rebecca T.' ultimate dream is to see all of her children graduate and succeed at whatever profession they take on.

farming is an economic activity dedicated to the raising of animals in order to generate revenue from the animals and the products they provide. Ravshanbek has earned a living from raising cattle since he was young. He's married and has 5 children that, according to Ravshanbek\u2019s words, are his reason for living. It should be said that the low incomes available to people in this rural aren't enough to maintain a family and for this reason, Ravshanbek works enormously hard to provide a better standard of living for his wife and children. Ravshanbek urgently needs to buy animals such as cows and calves. He's applied for a loan of $1700 USD. Be an important part of the growth of Ravshanbek\u2019s business.    \n\n\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\n\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nVilma is married and has three school-aged children. To make a living, Vilma owns and operates a business of selling dried fish and vegetables in the market. Aside from that, she also has a hog-raising business. Vilma has been engaged in her business for over three years and earns approximately $88 a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Vilma joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. Vilma is requesting a new loan of 6,000 PHP which will be used to purchase some hog feed. This will be her 3rd loan from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated to improve her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful micro-finance institutions in the Philippines.

She is married and has three children who are 27, 23 and 20 years old. In 2005, she established her handicraft business. Working six days a week and five hours a day, she supoorts her family. She has already received and successfully repaid four loans from Patan BPW, and used her most recent loan to purchase raw materials for her business.  \r\n\r\nIn the future, Goma plans to uplift the economic condition of her family. She thanks you for your support.   \r\n\r\nNepal has a long and rich history of traditional handicrafts. Throughout the Kathmandu Valley, skilled artisans produce unique pieces of art that reflect Nepal's cultural diversity. Terra cotta pottery comes from the red clay of the surrounding Himalayan foothills. Bronze and silver statuettes are formed using wax molds and intricate hand tool finishing. In Patan, Newari culture and traditions are reflected in the images and symbols etched into metal or formed in stone. With the help of a Kiva loan, Nepal's artisans are able to purchase raw materials in greater volume. This increase in volume allows a single artisan to work on several pieces at the same time while increasing her profit margin. \r\n\r\nThis loan was administered by Kiva's local partner MFI, Patan Business and Professional Women. Patan BPW became Kiva's first field partner in Nepal in 2007. Patan BPW operates throughout the Kathmandu Valley, offering microcredit and business training programs to low-income women.

She is a resident of Dasmari\u00f1as, Cavite, Philippines. She is married to Benjamin, a jeepney (transport) operator, and is a mother to her two children. She, together with her husband and children, manages their household while operating the business.  At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nMira operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store that retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, 5-pesos worth of cooking oil or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Aside from this, they have a jeep (public utility vehicle) that her husband manages. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 1,300 Philippines pesos (php) in sales every day. \r\n    \r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php 12,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nMira hopes her business grows in the coming years and dreams to be able to give her children a good and high quality education through all her hard work on her business.

She never received an education, but she knows how to get by in life. Starting in 2004, she got into the charcoal business, a field in which she is an expert. She learned how to make charcoal when she was young from her mother, who also made charcoal. Thus, she knows how to discern high quality charcoal, which she then offers to her customers. She buys charcoal from the surrounding villages that she then resells in Lom\u00e9. The only problem that Mrs. Ofriman has encountered is that she does not have enough money to buy sufficient quantities of charcoal. She has to travel often to buy charcoal, which increases her costs. Thus she is requesting her first loan so she can increase her working capital and decrease her costs as a result.\r\n<b><p>Translated from French by Manuel Carreiro, Kiva Volunteer<\/b><p>\r\nN\u00e9e le 16 mars 1974 \u00e0 Atakpam\u00e9 au TOGO, madame O.

This is his first loan through ACCION USA and he plans to expand very soon. He enjoys this work because it comes easily to him and he loves to be able to set and achieve his own goals for his business. \n\nThanks to the flexibility of his job as a cab driver, he has time to find metal through the internet and create a contract with business partners in India to buy the metal.

Her dream is that her children succeed in completing their studies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Mariana Hungria, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":352394,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"Working capital for her business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Leon","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.435556 -86.879444","type":"point"}},"partner_id":96,"posted_date":"2009-07-15T23:20:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosa Maria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-07-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":6000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2009-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2009-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2009-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2009-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2010-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2010-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2010-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":750}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.63},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.63},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.63},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.63},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.63},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.63},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.63},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.59}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":40.63,"local_amount":750,"processed_date":"2009-08-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T15:27:49Z","rounded_local_amount":808.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73600016},{"amount":40.63,"local_amount":750,"processed_date":"2009-09-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T17:53:07Z","rounded_local_amount":808.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87035905},{"amount":40.63,"local_amount":750,"processed_date":"2009-10-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T21:36:57Z","rounded_local_amount":808.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96948299},{"amount":40.63,"local_amount":750,"processed_date":"2009-11-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T12:32:20Z","rounded_local_amount":808.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103790227},{"amount":41.8,"local_amount":771.74,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T13:33:41Z","rounded_local_amount":831.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110680890},{"amount":40.84,"local_amount":753.91,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:34:58Z","rounded_local_amount":812.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118075426},{"amount":39.25,"local_amount":724.35,"processed_date":"2010-02-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:08:41Z","rounded_local_amount":780.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123911473},{"amount":40.59,"local_amount":750,"processed_date":"2010-03-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-06T07:50:41Z","rounded_local_amount":808.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128947321}],"funded_date":"2009-07-16T23:37:42Z","paid_date":"2010-05-06T07:50:41Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Mariana Hungria","image":null}},{"id":125931,"name":"Zaujath","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Zaujath is a member of the Upendo North borrower group in Kinyanambo, Iringa.

This will be his 10th loan with Kiva partner MFP, and he doesn't want to default on his payments so he can continue looking for more work and making more money and do right by the people who made this loan possible. With the loan of 1,500 soles he is requesting, he plans to purchase wooden planks and metal post so he will be able to do construction jobs.

Her in-laws would not let her live a peaceful life, that notwithstanding, she also has the problem of inadequate capital to start up a good business for income generation. \r\n\r\nShe has taken and repaid loans 10 times since she joined GHAPE in the year 2002.  The amount she is requesting will be used to buy motor spare parts to add to what she already has.  She thinks she will succeed in the business because of the expertise she has gotten and the marketing techniques acquired in relation to this business venture.  Her activity will help the community since car owners will buy parts to repair their cars at cheaper rates. \r\n\r\nWith the profit obtained from this loan she will use it to improve on her standard of living, pay tuition fees for her children and improve her family's financial problems.  She prefers a loan from GHAPE because it is easy to obtain a loan from GHAPE and with low interest rates and the period of repayment is gradual.\r\n\r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon.

Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement.  GHAPE instils a sense of family and community within its clients and staff and has developed a strong bond of trust between the organization and its clients.

They live in their own house located in the Parque Industrial neighborhood of the Pichari district.  When a business or activity that one is involved with is no longer profitable, an immediate change is necessary, if not, whatever capital one had invested could be lost.  This is the case with Yanet, who in time noticed that her business of selling groceries was no longer profitable because on the block where she lives there are many stores selling groceries.  That is why she decided to buy and sell small animals in her space that previously was the grocery store.  She has acquired many customers in the small time that she has been in business.  She not only sells animals but also added the sale of ground spices which has also provided a good income.  She is excited about the good income that she is earning up until now with the help of her husband and her repeat customers.

She sells shoes and sandals every day in the city of Caman\u00e1, located in the south of Peru. This area is a vast and dry oasis in the Desierto de Sechura, which dominates the south-eastern coast of the country. Caman\u00e1 has historically been an important tourist destination in Peru. However, the frequent and strong earthquakes and tsunamis in the past decade (an 8.4 in 2001 and an 8.0 in 2007) decimated the city, destroyed the tourist industry in Caman\u00e1, as well as jobs, livelihoods, and homes. The result of this unemployment has been the creation of an atmosphere ripe for microfinancing. Microfinancing gives people with small businesses and few resources business opportunities in the labour market.\r\n\r\nLeonarda's husband is a master builder, and this brings in a good income. They use this money to invest in the small business, as well as in the care and education of their little children. The youngest is barely two years old, and the oldest is 8. Leonarda tells us that one of her favourite dishes is \u201cChupe de Camarones\u201d [Shrimp Chowder]. In Caman\u00e1 it is easy to find and enjoy this delicious dish because they are very close to the sea--this guarantees the freshness of the product.\r\n\r\nLeonarda is a woman who works an average of eleven hours a day. This allows her to make 130 Soles per day. With this money, she is able to pay the original cost of the shoes. She thinks that her business is successful because she provides good customer service and is very charismatic. Thanks to the Kiva lenders, she will be able to buy new merchandise to sell. This will allow her to provide better customer service, thus making a better income. Her dream is to be able to expand the size of her business and therefore increase her income in order to be able to thatch the roof of her home."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1125,"image":{"id":951613,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Shoe

Amelia esta pidiendo un cr\u00e9dito para comprar insecticidas, abono org\u00e1nico, fertilizantes, calidra y arboles de aguacate. La meta de do\u00f1a Amelia es seguir haciendo crecer su huerto y cuando empiece a tener ganancias quiere poner la cerca nueva para que los animales no se le metan a comer sus arboles. Dice que ella esta muy contenta con trabajar con la financiera por que gracias a esta su negocio si esta funcionando y espera nunca defraudarla ya que le tendieron la mano cuando mas lo necesitaba.\n\n","en":"Amelia is a 58 year old widow.  She had five children, but she lives alone because her children are married.\r\n\r\nShe says that she is from a place that is rich in nature.  The inhabitants safeguard the forests because the loggers cut the trees without permission.  She says that in her community the people preserve their roots.  They speak and dress \u201cmazahua\u201d (an indigenous people of Mexico), which they are proud of.\r\n\r\nAmelia says she started to grow avocadoes over two years ago.  She says that, \u201ceven though it is a business in the long term, it pleases me to grow this fruit because it is well suited to the climate.  The crop is not difficult to take care of, and shortly they will bear fruit in May.  God willing, I will have my first harvest even though various little trees started to bear fruit.\u201d  \r\n\r\nShe says that now, as she does not have any income from the avocados, she makes crafts from \u201cocoshal\u201d (dry leaves that come from a pine tree).  She makes things like napkin rings, bread baskets, jewelry cases, fruit dishes, and decorative vases.  She takes them to sell at the Monarch Butterfly Sanctuary because it is very close to her area.  \r\n\r\nAmelia is asking for a loan to buy insecticides, organic fertilizer, fertilizers, Calidra (brand of hydrated lime powder), and avocado trees.   Amelia\u2019s goal is to continue making her orchard grow.  When she starts to have income she wants to put up a new fence so that the animals do not get in and eat her trees.  \r\n\r\nShe says that she is very happy to work with the loan because, thanks to the loan, her business is functioning.  She hopes to never let the lenders down because they lent a hand when she needed it most.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":964385,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy insecticides, organic fertilizer, fertilizers, Calidra (brand of hydrated lime powder), and avocado trees.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2011-12-29T20:30:17Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":725,"lender_count":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Amelia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-12-21T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":895.08},{"due_date":"2012-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":938.45},{"due_date":"2012-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":955.97},{"due_date":"2012-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":973.81},{"due_date":"2012-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":991.99},{"due_date":"2012-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1010.51},{"due_date":"2012-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":1029.37},{"due_date":"2012-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1048.59},{"due_date":"2012-04-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1068.16},{"due_date":"2012-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":1088.07}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":64.89},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.04},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.31},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.6},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.92},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.26},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.63},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.02},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.44},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.89}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":132.93,"local_amount":1833.53,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T10:27:35Z","rounded_local_amount":1858.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257193884},{"amount":211.83,"local_amount":2921.77,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:42:00Z","rounded_local_amount":2961.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263330240},{"amount":73.26,"local_amount":1010.5,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T09:42:50Z","rounded_local_amount":1024.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270044258},{"amount":228.09,"local_amount":3146.13,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:48:20Z","rounded_local_amount":3188.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276656453},{"amount":78.89,"local_amount":1088.07,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T16:57:01Z","rounded_local_amount":1102.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283317169}],"funded_date":"2011-12-29T22:12:55Z","paid_date":"2012-06-15T16:57:01Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ginny Kalish"}},{"id":380869,"name":"Zoila Rosa","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Zoila de 24 a\u00f1os fue educada por su madre con mucha responsabilidad y valores morales en los que enmarca su vida, pues al quedar hu\u00e9rfana vio como su madre los sac\u00f3 adelante y la llev\u00f3 a lograr su licenciatura en matem\u00e1ticas.

It was after he completed this loan and after he heard about Hluvuku from friends that he decided to pursue a loan from Hluvuku, which is closer to his home and work. Jeremias\u2019s first Hluvuku loan was for 10,200 MZN, and it was also used for home construction. This will be his second loan with Hluvuku and his first with Kiva.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the

This year they have planted 30 sacks of seeds in irrigated fields and 20 sacks in seasonal fields, thanks to the help of their children who still accompany them. Both feel very satisfied and thankful to the land that provides them its fruits. Once they have collected their harvest, they will contract a truck to transport it to various markets for its sale, recuperate their investment and return to plant the next field. They always try to attend the meetings at their community bank, and when they miss one, they ask permission from their credit assessor. This is their eighth loan with MFP, and they have always shown to be good clients. The money that they request will be diverted to the purchase of fertilizers for their planted fields to assure a good harvest. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Rebecca Towle, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":975,"image":{"id":293053,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy fertilizers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-03-24T18:30:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":975,"lender_count":28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Octavia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-03-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":975,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":3000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":975}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":975,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2009-09-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:33:20Z","rounded_local_amount":3026.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87080288}],"funded_date":"2009-03-24T19:48:50Z","paid_date":"2009-10-15T23:33:20Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Rebecca Towle","image":225476}},{"id":101371,"name":"Ganbold","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ganbold L. is 39, married, and the father of four.

Esta labor la realiza desde las nueve de la ma\u00f1ana hasta las seis de la tarde, siendo muy cansado debido las distancias que tiene que recorrer, tratando de realizarlas r\u00e1pidamente para  llegar a tiempo de apoyar a sus hijos en las actividades educativas.

She has worked for four years selling cosmetics, a job that she does with much joy, as she has the chance to make a good income.  In order to increase her sales, she has to go out and visit her friends and relatives, who are her regular clients.  She does this work from 9am until 6pm, and she becomes very tired from the long distances that she must travel, trying to make the trips quickly so she can arrive home with time to support her children\u2019s educational activities.  For this reason she has decided to use her savings of many years to buy a moto-car which she will use for public transport.  She will administer the earnings from her home, and in this way will have extra income, which will make up for the additional time that she will dedicate to her family without having to leave to sell her cosmetics.  This is her first individual loan, but she continues working happily with the communal bank, Kiva partner Microfinanzas Prisma, to which she has belonged for many years and where she is very committed to the growth of the group.  With the 3,000 soles that she is requesting she will buy a moto-car that she needs to move ahead with her projects.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Laura Westin, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1025,"image":{"id":330898,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Buy a moto-car ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-06-08T05:10:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1025,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Baleria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-05-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":200.42},{"due_date":"2009-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":211.23},{"due_date":"2009-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":218.88},{"due_date":"2009-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":226.79},{"due_date":"2009-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":237.54},{"due_date":"2009-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":243.59},{"due_date":"2009-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":254.37},{"due_date":"2010-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":261.61},{"due_date":"2010-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":272.44},{"due_date":"2010-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":284.03},{"due_date":"2010-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":290.51},{"due_date":"2010-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":298.59}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.48},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.17},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.78},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.49},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81.16},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.23},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":86.91},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":89.38},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.08},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.04},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":99.26},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.02}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":69.69,"local_amount":203.98,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:45:35Z","rounded_local_amount":208.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52990720},{"amount":70.96,"local_amount":207.67,"processed_date":"2009-07-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:44:35Z","rounded_local_amount":212.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63211822},{"amount":74.78,"local_amount":218.88,"processed_date":"2009-08-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:27:23Z","rounded_local_amount":223.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73641347},{"amount":77.49,"local_amount":226.79,"processed_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:42:02Z","rounded_local_amount":232.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87080787},{"amount":81.16,"local_amount":237.54,"processed_date":"2009-10-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:14:21Z","rounded_local_amount":243.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96996926},{"amount":83.23,"local_amount":243.59,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:56:35Z","rounded_local_amount":249.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103842266},{"amount":544.21,"local_amount":1592.82,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T21:05:54Z","rounded_local_amount":1629.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110733889},{"amount":23.48,"local_amount":68.73,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:38:00Z","rounded_local_amount":70.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136717158}],"funded_date":"2009-06-27T16:57:45Z","paid_date":"2010-05-15T11:38:00Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Laura Westin","image":54967}},{"id":117755,"name":"Jesusa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jesusa R. works in a family member's business making and selling specialty food products in her community.

Her oldest son is already earning for himself and the other one has just finished a nursing degree in college.\r\n<p>\r\nSaveniana and her husband parted ways almost two decades ago.  She was left to care for and rear her 2 sons. But this never hindered her from moving forward.  She went into business.  She owns a general store, which has been running for the last 7 years.  And just last year, she opened a store for RTW (ready-to-wear) clothes in Cartimar.  She used her savings as capital for this new business.  She makes P25,000.00 a month out of the combined proceeds of her businesses.\r\n<p>\r\nSaveniana joined Center for Community Transformation (CCT) Credit Cooperative in 2002.

She is also a source of support for her husband in the various roles they have, such as parents of two children who live with them in the house which they managed to build after a great deal of effort. Five years ago they had the chance to acquire three \u2018motocarros\u2019 (three-wheeled motorized carts), which are a great help in making ends meet. Carmen manages the business and makes sure the motocarros are working properly. The vehicles are rented to various people, generally young men, who earn a living by transporting passengers in these \u2018taxis\u2019. For this reason Carmen checks that they are responsible people and use the motocarros in an appropriate manner. Repairs and maintenance are essential, and she tries to have them done every month to avoid a major breakdown which would affect their economic situation. \r\n\r\nIn the short term, Carmen plans to save money to buy an additional vehicle which can be used to bring in money if one of the others is under repair.

He is a construction worker and his wife, Mrs. Sothea Nhel, is a farmer who owns 2 hectares of land to cultivate rice on to support her family. Now they are facing an obstacle because their house is too old to live in, but they do not have money to repair it.

He owns a minivan and offers transportation services in the city. He understands his role as the head and provider for his family, and is ready to work 24\/7 to provide for the needs of his loved ones. He has been faithfully working in this business for eight years. \r\n\r\nAbdumavlon has found his niche in this business. Today, it\u2019s a lot harder to start your own business as a public van driver. Currently, Abdumavlon\u2019s net profit is about $500 a month. An economical diesel engine in his vehicle helps him reduce his operating costs and adds to his bottom line. Loans that Abdumavlon has received from IMON International have helped to promote stability and growth in his business. \r\n\r\nAbdumavlon is asking for a loan of 7,000 Somoni to purchase necessary car parts to fix his minivan. He understands the effort and commitment it takes to be a private entrepreneur and is willing to work hard in his business to be able to support his family, which is the first priority in his life. \r\n\r\n<b>More about Tajikistan and IMON International<\/b>\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes being a key post along the Silk Road, and for the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Geofrey is the facilitator of the group. This group joined One Acre Fund in the year 2011 and will re-enroll in the 2012 program. \r\n\r\nGeofrey takes care of six children at home. He joined One Acre Fund in order to grow enough to feed his family and access fertilizer and hybrid seeds. In the recent 2011 season, he had a very good maize yield harvesting 12 1\/2 bags on one acre of land.

She's asking for a loan to stock summer products because in the beach season there will be a big demand for sardines, canned tuna, etc.  By working hard and using credit wisely, she hopes her small store will ultimately become a large general store and that when she is older, her children will take it over as a family business so that they can lead dignified lives.\r\n<p><b>Translated from Spanish by Jere Wiseman, Kiva Volunteer<\/b><p>\r\nDo\u00f1a Elvira R., es madre solera de 45 a\u00f1os, habita en una humilde vivienda del Barrio Laureles Sur  y desde hace 10 a\u00f1os de forma improvisada mont\u00f3 una peque\u00f1a venta de productos varios, con cr\u00e9ditos ha venido creciendo y hoy en d\u00eda tiene una pulper\u00eda abastecida con toda clase de productos de alimentos l\u00e1cteos, enlatados, alimentos crudos como  frijoles y arroz entre otras cosas de importancia en el hogar como papel higi\u00e9nico, pasta de dientes, etc. Solicita un  Pr\u00e9stamo para abastecer de productos de verano para esta \u00e9poca de playa  en que se demanda mucho las sardinas, at\u00fan enlatados, con su esfuerzo y el buen uso de sus cr\u00e9ditos su sue\u00f1o es  que su pulper\u00eda sea una  Miscel\u00e1nea grande y que cuando ella este mayor sus  hijos la administren y mejoren el negocio familiar con el cual su madre pudo darles una vida digna."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":137688,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Buy product for resale.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Managua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.150833 -86.268333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":98,"posted_date":"2008-03-08T22:40:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":725,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elvira","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-03-23T18:05:44Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":13520,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":2253.33},{"due_date":"2008-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":2253.33},{"due_date":"2008-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":2253.33},{"due_date":"2008-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":2253.33},{"due_date":"2008-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":2253.33},{"due_date":"2008-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":2253.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":120.83},{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":120.83},{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":120.83},{"due_date":"2008-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":120.83},{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":120.83},{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":120.85}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":121,"local_amount":2256.44,"processed_date":"2008-04-23T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-28T19:46:05Z","rounded_local_amount":2307.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":189717},{"amount":121,"local_amount":2256.44,"processed_date":"2008-05-23T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-28T19:47:40Z","rounded_local_amount":2307.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":217787},{"amount":121,"local_amount":2256.44,"processed_date":"2008-06-23T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-28T19:49:40Z","rounded_local_amount":2307.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":246779},{"amount":121,"local_amount":2256.44,"processed_date":"2008-07-23T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-28T19:53:00Z","rounded_local_amount":2307.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":275342},{"amount":121,"local_amount":2256.44,"processed_date":"2008-08-23T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-28T19:56:58Z","rounded_local_amount":2307.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":304890},{"amount":120,"local_amount":2237.79,"processed_date":"2008-09-23T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-09-24T07:07:27Z","rounded_local_amount":2288.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":335838}],"funded_date":"2008-03-09T18:05:44Z","paid_date":"2008-09-24T07:07:27Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":44021,"name":"Fatima Rosario","description":{"languages":["es"],"texts":{"es":"F\u00e1tima C. is married and has an 8-year old daughter who is an elementary school student.

Martha has 4 children.  Her oldest son is 45 and self-employed, her second son is 38 and self-employed, her 33 year-old daughter is studying the 5th year of secondary school, and her other son is 28 and studying for an Advanced Technical Degree.  Her husband does not work due to his advanced age.  Her proposal is to expand her business and turn it into a cafeteria where she can offer customers home-style cooking and a la carte meals.  She also hopes to have a store so that she can have various incomes to meet the difficult economic situation.\r\n\r\nIn her business she sells meals: breakfast, lunch, and refreshments.  She has had this business for 10 years and works at it daily.  She started this business with a small table where she sold fruits and vegetables.  Then later she decided to put together a store, which she started with only a few items.  However because of personal problems she decided to make a trip out of the country, and she had no choice but to leave her daughter in charge of the business.  When she decided to return to the country her business had completely declined, and she tried to start over again with another by selling food.  This is what she has been committed to until now, so that what happened to her other business does not happen again.  She has a variety of customers like doctors, nurses, and employees from different places.  The loan is for capital to buy fresh fruits and vegetables to make natural refreshments and fresh meat for making her different meals.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Kelly Wester, Kiva

market, ask anyone about Munavvarhon A.. Everyone knows her. She has sold leafy green vegetables for the past ten years, starting out with dill, parsley, garlic, radishes and sorrel. Her inventory additionally includes canned fruit and vegetables.\r\n\r\nMunavvarhon previously lived and worked in Kanibadam, but after the death of her husband she moved to Isfara. Her daughters married and she now lives with her 18-year-old grandson.  \r\n\r\nAlthough she is 53 years old, Munavvarhon herself travels to Khojand twice a week to buy greens. Her friends also supply her with vegetables from Kokand, Uzbekistan at a good price. In the spring Munavvarhon grows dill, parsley and salad greens in her own garden.  She recognizes that competition is fierce and prices have begun to rise.  She does all she can to improve her business, and offers discounts on bulk orders in order to keep customers. For the past two years Munavvarhon has taken out business loans and she acknowledges that it is thanks to MicroInvest that she was able to expand her range of products.  Taking advantage of the low summertime prices, with the last loan she purchased a large quantity of canned goods and vegetables in order to stock up for the winter. She is planning to open an additional retail outlet with her next loan.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Russian by Joyce ., Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":259348,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Opening of a new retail outlet","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Isfara","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"40.116667 70.633333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":47,"posted_date":"2009-02-18T18:10:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":575,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Munavvarkhon","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-12-24T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":305.34},{"due_date":"2009-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":316.03},{"due_date":"2009-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":327.09},{"due_date":"2009-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":338.54},{"due_date":"2009-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":350.38},{"due_date":"2009-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":362.62}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":87.79},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":90.86},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":94.04},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.33},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100.73},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":178.64,"local_amount":621.37,"processed_date":"2009-02-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T20:18:44Z","rounded_local_amount":622.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20427166},{"amount":94.04,"local_amount":327.09,"processed_date":"2009-03-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:55:52Z","rounded_local_amount":327.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27120672},{"amount":97.33,"local_amount":338.54,"processed_date":"2009-04-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T22:08:36Z","rounded_local_amount":338.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36015789},{"amount":100.73,"local_amount":350.38,"processed_date":"2009-05-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T01:16:12Z","rounded_local_amount":350.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44599526},{"amount":104.26,"local_amount":362.62,"processed_date":"2009-06-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-21T07:47:43Z","rounded_local_amount":363.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52993976}],"funded_date":"2009-02-19T02:07:55Z","paid_date":"2009-07-21T07:47:43Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Joyce .","image":null}},{"id":89099,"name":"Gulzar Allah Wasaya Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Gulzar Baji is a 37-year-old married lady and has resided in a city named Multan, Pakistan for the past 24 years.

Umedjon is 33 years old, married, and has three children. All of his life he has devoted to agricultural work, and on market days he brings his products to the market. For Umedjon the harvest is what he enjoys the most and he devotes a lot of time to sorting wheat, onions, watermelon and rice. \r\n\r\nAgriculture is full of satisfaction for him and his family, even more when they sell for a good price at the market. That is the motivation to continue planting. At the same time Umedjon raises cattle. \r\n\r\nThis is the 9th loan that Umedjon has with IMON International, making his payments on time. He is very grateful to those who support him, because they allow him to provide well-being to his family. With the money requested, Umedjon will buy seeds, fertilizer, fuels and lubricants, and also cattle.       \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.\r\n\r\nTo learn more about IMON International's work, please visit: www.imon.tj\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3000,"image":{"id":596313,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Purchasing seed, fertilizer, fuels and lubricants, cattle","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Shahrituz","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":100,"posted_date":"2010-09-08T12:40:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":3000,"lender_count":107,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Umedjon","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-09-06T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":3000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":976.82},{"due_date":"2011-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":996.18},{"due_date":"2011-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1027}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":976.82},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":996.18},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1027}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":0.3,"local_amount":0.3,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-17T10:43:04Z","rounded_local_amount":0.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177695983},{"amount":1.11,"local_amount":1.11,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-19T07:52:29Z","rounded_local_amount":1.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206666245},{"amount":2107.55,"local_amount":2107.55,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-16T08:10:25Z","rounded_local_amount":2107.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211444721},{"amount":891.04,"local_amount":891.04,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-17T07:50:22Z","rounded_local_amount":891.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221989828}],"funded_date":"2010-09-15T23:02:30Z","paid_date":"2011-08-17T07:50:22Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Diane Bird","image":220084}},{"id":233343,"name":"Sok","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sok M., 46, is a professional silk weaver, making US$ 2 each day in Takeo province.

She is still sad about his death, but the constant support she receives from her 3 children motivates her. She lives alone in her own home in the city of San Ram\u00f3n (in the central Peruvian rainforest). The happiness she shows is a reflection of the support she receives from her children, who built their houses around her so they could look after her. Elena makes a living selling food, vegetables and fruits, from a little space set up in her home. She has been at this business for 4 years, but as this successful woman tells us, she also has a business selling coffee and honey. She gets these products in the city of Perene, where she travels constantly, and then sells them in the country\u2019s capital. Elena\u2019s strengths are surprising because she also grows potatoes in the city of Tarma, where she travels every harvest season. She is, however, aware of her advanced age, which is why she would like to buy a knitting machine to make sweaters to sell in the city of Huancayo and La Oroya. This is her eighth MFP loan, and she is happy belonging to her communal bank, which, in her own words, \u201cis like family.\u201d Once she gets the requested loan, she will use it to buy supplies for her grocery shop and if she makes any extra money she will spend it on growing potatoes.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":681177,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Purchase of grocery items and to invest in growing potatoes","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Chanchamayo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.05 -75.316667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:28Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":725,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elena ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-12-23T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":162.87},{"due_date":"2011-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":170.2},{"due_date":"2011-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":177.86},{"due_date":"2011-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":185.86},{"due_date":"2011-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":194.23},{"due_date":"2011-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":202.96},{"due_date":"2011-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":212.1},{"due_date":"2011-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":221.64},{"due_date":"2011-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":231.62},{"due_date":"2011-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":240.66}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.04},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.7},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.47},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.38},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.4},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.58},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.88},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.35},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.96},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.24}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":59.04,"local_amount":162.87,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T04:40:26Z","rounded_local_amount":165.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191463724},{"amount":61.7,"local_amount":170.2,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T08:52:30Z","rounded_local_amount":173.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195887107},{"amount":64.75,"local_amount":178.62,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:37:01Z","rounded_local_amount":181.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201327468},{"amount":67.64,"local_amount":186.59,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:32:55Z","rounded_local_amount":189.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206196015},{"amount":69.86,"local_amount":192.74,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:41:56Z","rounded_local_amount":196.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211269699},{"amount":73.94,"local_amount":203.97,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:32:35Z","rounded_local_amount":207.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216549704},{"amount":76.52,"local_amount":211.09,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T09:13:48Z","rounded_local_amount":214.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221718399},{"amount":80.35,"local_amount":221.64,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-17T08:12:53Z","rounded_local_amount":225.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227349958},{"amount":84.91,"local_amount":234.24,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:48:47Z","rounded_local_amount":238.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232850518},{"amount":86.29,"local_amount":238.04,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:58:03Z","rounded_local_amount":242.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238665764}],"funded_date":"2011-01-04T03:30:04Z","paid_date":"2011-11-15T10:58:03Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":266128,"name":"Akil","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This borrower is from Iraq.

She earns her living by operating a general store. Her husband Salde, who is 44 years old, helps in his wife's business activities. They have two children who are 10 and 18 years old. Vivian joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1991 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 29 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Vivian has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 29,500 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 2,000,  uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 30th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 29,500, to purchase more stock to sell so that she can continue to save up for her children's education. Vivian is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.
