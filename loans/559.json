Currently, he\u2019s been working for 30 years and with the experience he\u2019s gained over two decades of non-stop work he\u2019s managed to position himself among customers who recognize him as a supplier of fresh tomatoes, cucumbers, peppers and avocadoes in the town market in Rionegro, Antiquia.\r\n\r\nAt present, Francisco needs to buy a supply for his business as well as baskets to display his products.  However, he lacks the economic resources to do so.

She plans to use the profit from her business (estimated to be 500 talas or US $208 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2011, La joined SPBD to gain access to financial services. Most of SPBD's clients are unable to borrow from commercial banks, because they lack collateral.  This is La's 1st loan with SPBD. \r\n\r\n*SPBD evaluates the living conditions of each of its borrowers.  Generally, a loan manager evaluates a variety of social metrics on a scale out of 3 (the higher the number, the better off the person is) and these are averaged for the \"overall social metric score.\"  For example, a 3 out of 3 on \"level of education\" would mean that the borrower has graduated from university.  \r\n\r\nAbout SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.

The women share professional ties, kinship, friendship and live in the same neighborhood. They primarily trade in condiments, grains, fresh cow\u2019s milk, pagnes (lengths of brightly-colored African cloth), and firewood.  Some aspects of their business are of a daily variety, as in milk, while others are seasonal (grains, wood and condiments, et cetera). To meet the ever-increasing customer demand, they decided to join the loan program at the Soro Yiriwaso microfinance institution, which has granted them three group loans, all repaid in full.<p>\r\n\r\nThe women in the group often replenish their stock of coarse grains and fresh cow\u2019s milk locally in Zogofina, but at times go to the neighboring villages of Zenguela and Soignebougou for firewood, and to the regional capital of S\u00e9gou for condiments, pagnes and rice. With this loan they expect to buy 50 liters of fresh cow\u2019s milk (20 liters per day), 150 kilograms of coarse grains and pulses (millet, peanuts, beans, et cetera), 4 cartloads of firewood, 10 lengths of quality pagne and 300 kilograms of spices and rice.<p>\r\n\r\nProducts are then generally sold retail for cash or credit on market day at the village square, or both during the day and in the evening from home.  Their customers generally consist of women and men coming from other villages to make their purchases in Zogofina.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients have viable business propositions. Funds raised through Kiva have been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

His greatest desire is to see his family get ahead.  He tries to provide them with the best care and attention within his home.  He has been selling groceries for 9 years in the store he set up.  It is in a rented place in a very commercial area.  With out a doubt, working in this trade helped him improve his house and offer his children quality schooling.  He begins work early by cleaning the store.  He must wait on customers that shop early so Mr. Victor tries to have the doors open by 6 in the morning.  He tends to his business, together with his wife, until midnight.  He is careful since there are more sales at night but also greater danger due to delinquency.  Victor wants to open another store in his home, like a branch of the main store, in the near future.  He, as well as all his co-workers, have known how to manage themselves responsibly at their community bank in the five years he has been working with MFP.  This has made his group one of the most trustworthy and organized in the institution.

He\u2019s 49 years old. He\u2019s married and has 3 children, ages 24, 22 and 18. The middle child is currently going to school. He finished up to 6th grade of the old school system, but he couldn't continue because his parents had serious financial problems. He lives in his own house with his family and he also supports his father, who lives in the city of Maputo, sending him money and food.\r\n\r\nHe left Maputo to go to Beira for a service mission in 1983. That same year he was transferred from Beira to Nampula, north of Mozambique to continue with his activity. Once his service was completed, he returned to the capital city, where he lives now. He\u2019s worked for TCM (Mozambique Transportation and Communications) as HR Manager since 1982, 8 hours a day. After his day time job, he devotes around 4 hours a day to his business. He gets a 7.800.00 salary from his company and 4.000.00mt a month from his business, which he uses for household expenses. He saves around 1.500.00mt from time to time to put on his bank account. \r\n\r\nHe received a loan from Millinium Bim bank, but after he finished his payments he decided to leave. He met Hluvuku through a soccer tournament where he was a referee and Hluvuku was participating, so he decided to visit our organization. This is his 2nd loan for an amount of 20.000.00mt, which he will use to buy products, such as oil, eggs, milk, drinks and others, to increase his stock. His previous loan was for 12.000.00mt which he used for this same activity. (1 dollar = 28.51MT)\r\n \r\nIn the future he would like to request for more loans to make home improvements and to restock him business. For this reason, he\u2019s committed to pay this loan in time and access to more money later.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Jimena Lopez, Kiva

To make a living, Charito owns and operates a furniture-making business. She makes and sells general household furniture to local businesses and community members. Charito has been engaged in her business for over five years and earns approximately $220 a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2006, Charito joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation by engaging in business activities. Charito has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase raw materials to make additional furniture. Charito is requesting a new loan of 7,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional raw materials to expand her product line. This will be her 8th loan from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to further expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful micro-finance institutions in the Philippines.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

During her previous loans from ASHI, she carefully invested in her buy and sell business, selling different goods, and embarked on a sewing business. The profit is what she uses for daily expenses.\r\n\r\nDuring her almost one year in ASHI, Rodalyn has shown herself to be hardworking and she has strong belief to make her dreams come true. Rodalyn still dreams of the best for her family: to provide the best education for her children and to have a happy family. \r\n\r\nNow on her second loan, Rodalyn requests 9,000 Philippine pesos to create a broader business. Specifically, the money will be used to purchase cotton and planel for her sewing business and an inventory of rice for her buy and sell business. She is very determined and disciplined to utilize the money which is lent to her.\r\n\r\nRodalyn is grateful to ASHI-Kiva partners for the support, even with all the dreams and challenges in her

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

In the future he\u2019d like to improve the quality of his products thus obtaining better prices.\r\n\r\nThis is his 8th loan with MFP.  He feels that the loan will be very beneficial for his growth as a farmer.  He is a very active and supportive member of his communal bank.\r\n\r\nHe will use the requested 2000 new soles to buy more manure and fertilizers to improve the productivity of his fields.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":635942,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To

It is located in Cordoba's savannah region. He thought of his enterprising idea in the city of Barranquilla when the community had its first inhabitants. At first he sold fried foods and natural fruit drinks, including orange, lemon, mango, zapote (a fleshy tropical fruit), medlar, watermelon, melon, and guanabana (a fragrant tropical fruit). His business gradually expanded and he added common foods with the goal of catering to the clientele he had already won. Today he has a space in his house that has become too small to support the growth of his business and this is just the challenge he faces. He needs to recondition it and in the future to move it to a new location. His Kiva loan is the first he has with Fundacion Mario Santo Domingo (Kiva Field Partner) and with it he will purchase ingredients, such as rice, meats, and vegetables in large volumes to earn discounts on cash sales. He will also purchase tools for the kitchen to be able to serve his clients more freely. Pablo is married and he has 4 children between the ages of 12 and 23.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture, and Central Asian traditions. \r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still lives in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is married and does not have any children.  To make a living, Siupolu owns and operates an agricultural business raising crops. The main source of income for her business comes from planting, harvesting, and selling fruits and vegetables.  Siupolu has been in this business for over four years, and she earns approximately 156 Samoan Tala WST a month.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2009, Siupolu joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation, and her ability to engage in business activities.  Siupolu's first loan request from SPBD is for 1000 WST, which will be used to purchase harvesting equipment.  Siupolu plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business.\r\n<p>\r\nAbout SPBD:\r\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.\r\n<p>\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He is 36 years old, married, and the father of 4 children who are 6, 7, 9, and 11 years old.  All go to school.  He only studied through the 3rd grade because his parents died and he didn't have anybody who could support his studies.  He lives in the service workers houses with his family and even supports his brothers and sisters by sending money for the power and water bills.\r\n\r\nHe left Maputo for Boane in order to set up a new home with his family after he found a new job.  He has worked as a driver in the outlying ironworks sector for more than 10 years and works on average around 10 hours each day.  He receives a monthly salary of 6,799 MZN that he uses for household expenses.  He even saves some in his bank account.\r\n\r\nHe has never had loans through banks.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

(construction materials), and Sara Zen\u00f3n M. (lingerie sales by catalog).   \r\n\r\nReyna S. is a single mother with three children, who are already grown and married. She used to work as a cleaning lady, but when she began suffering from osteoporosis, she had to leave her job, since the condition affected her legs. She decided to dedicate herself to another kind of work, so 15 years ago, she began making hand-knitted garments such as blouses, jackets, scarves, sweaters, baby clothes, etc. At the beginning, it was hard for her, but with time and continuous practice, it became easier. At present, she buys magazines to make more modern clothing designs and satisfy her customers' needs. She will use the funds from the loan she is requesting to buy yarn, hook closures, buttons, zippers, etc. Whenever she goes out, Reyna takes a sample garment and also carries supplies to keep working during the journey. She offers her merchandise to her family members and neighbors. She makes the most sales for special days such as birthdays, and during the cold months. With her earnings, she wants to support her daughter with her therapy so that she will be able to walk again, since her daughter also has osteoporosis which is advancing very rapidly. In the future, Reyna plans to open her own store and put her blouses and jackets on display, so that people will get to know her work and she will increase her sales. \r\n\r\nReyna and the other members are grateful for the support provided to them by Kiva through the Realidad Foundation, which will help them achieve their goals. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Patricia

The difficulties she anticipates for this loan are the possibility of theft while the corn is still in the fields and also severe climactic conditions. \r\n\r\nHer strategy for business growth is to buy other fields to avoid paying rent for farming and to boost her crops. In the next few years, she would like to become a modern farmer and to have fields sufficient enough for farming and for creating employment for other people.

Being unable to get an education due to lack of support, he taught himself to drive and got his driving license in 1982. Unable to buy his own car, he frequented transportation centers to take over from drivers during their rest periods. However, this did not guarantee him enough income to support his household needs. Very quiet and serious, he worries constantly about his family\u2019s well-being. Despite his precarious situation, he succeeded in getting a $200 loan which he gave to his wife to set up a small food business so that she could contribute to the household expenses. With his help, his wife was able to manage and repay this loan, and she received a further loan, in her own name, which she is repaying with no problems.\r\n<p>\r\nMr. T. is now requesting a $2000 loan to buy a car so that he can provide a taxi service. The financing of this project will be of enormous help in stabilizing Mr. T.\u2019s income to provide for the needs of his family, and especially to ensure his children\u2019s education.\r\n\r\n<p><b>Translated from French by Alison Dent, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nN\u00e9 en 1962 \u00e0 Tchagba dans le Haho, Monsieur T.

Her husband is a good man, his name is Lauro, he works as an upholsterer. They live in a rented house. Her daughters are currently attending school \"Juan de Saber\", for her, this is the most important thing.\r\n\r\nWhen Julia met her husband, he already had his own business, but she says she is not married for money but for love. Now she helps him in his workshop by cutting and sewing fabric and foam. Moreover, she has also learned how to reupholster. Her brother-in-law, Segundo, helps them with the work. She works Monday through Friday from 8am to 6pm and until noon on Saturdays. The advantage of this business is being able to work together as a family, says Julia, as well as spending time together on the weekends. \r\n\r\nShe is asking for this loan in order to buy raw material (such as sponge, cloth, nails and contact cement) and wood for her workshop.

She lives with her mother, her grandmother, and her 2 children who are 7 and 3 years old and who depend entirely upon her for their support.  For the past 8 years, Edith has had a store selling perishable and highly sought after products, which are needed in the home.  But in spite of all this, many times she has not been able to provide the products people come to buy.  It is for this reason Edith is asking for a loan, in order to have enough money to stock the store with different products like beans, salt, sugar, vegetables, bread, etc.  This would be a big help to her, due to the fact that the store is the only source of income that Edith and her family have for getting ahead.  Her job is mainly difficult because she has the responsibility of helping out her two children, who both need her so much.  In spite of the difficult situation she faces, Edith does not lose her hope of improving her business this year and increasing sales and improving her family's lifestyle.  \r\n<br

Also, when it's the season for a holiday or festival that her city celebrates, she takes advantage of the time to sell some products; this is the case for Mes Morado (Purple Month), when she sold nougat candies, a dessert from Lima, and through these sales was able to get extra revenue. She is a very convincing saleswoman and is motivated by the fact that everything she sells leaves her, which forces her to supply herself with more products. She feels her business is very profitable, and thanks to that she is able to help her husband cover household expenses, besides, she counts on her in-laws' support for caring for her son. It is because of this confidence that she works hard and is motivated to succeed, always giving her customers friendly service. In time, she hopes to sell clothes or have a store for dress clothes. This is her 16th loan with Kiva partner MFP, and she knows that she has to make her payments on time, and she is ready to do so. In her communal bank she is a very responsible member, motivated by the fact that they respect her greatly.

She will plow her profit back into her business and use part to care for her family. She also will use the proceeds to pay her children's school fees, and she will save some for rainy days.

This community has a very large lake which provides a lot of fish and a lot of work each year.  It is also well known because the Cerro de Oro hydroelectric dam is located there.  This community is where \u00c1ngel lives.  \u00c1ngel is 36 years old, single, and studied up to the third year of high school.\r\n\r\n\u00c1ngel tells us that more than six years ago he started working in his own business so that he could help his parents with their household expenses.  He tells us that he sells shoes and perfumes to friends and neighbors in his community.  He says that he makes his sales door to door through catalogs and, over the years, he has gained more and more customers which has helped his business to prosper.

otras cosas, Do\u00f1a Juana nos dice que en ocasiones si ve dificil terminar de vender sus plasticos ya que no todas las amas de casa se animan a comprar, comenta que la situacion esta muy dificil y ella con tal de vender y de ganar aunque sea poco deja las cosas mas baratas pero no le gusta dejar las cosas fiadas ya que corre el riesgo de que algunas gentes no le paguen, tambien lo que se le ha echo muy dificil es conseguir sus clientes, porque son gente que tal ves en un momento te compren y despues de uno o dos meses te vuelven a comprar otra cosa diferente y en este momento do\u00f1a Juana tiene sus clientes y por esa razon quiere comprar nueva mercancia y lo que le gusta que siempre que va por nueva mercancia hay nuevos modelos de toopers mas bonitos que los anteriores y eso significa que los puede terminar de vender, a do\u00f1a Juana le conviene invertir por paquetes nos comenta que tiene mas ganancias y es mejor para ella por que evita ir mas seguido por cosas, tambien su esposo le ayuda en ocasiones para poder vender mas rapido las cosas porque en su trabajo ofrece a sus amigos, do\u00f1a Juana tiene 4 hijos no son mayores de edad y el mayor entro a la secundaria, tiene 13 a\u00f1os de casada y 32 a\u00f1os de edad, vive en casa prestada y su esposo trabaja, el lugar donde viven es en el barrio las Pe\u00f1as en una comunidad  que pertene al municipio de el

She carries a variety of styles and sizes and generally sells to women.  The products are good quality, not name-brand, but durable.  She offers, for example, gravy boats, lunch boxes, tortilla baskets, cups, plates, etc.  She tells us that it's tough at times to close a sale because not all the housewives are motivated to buy.\r\n\r\nJuana says it's hard, but as long as she's making sales and earning at least a little money, she can sell for less, although she doesn't like to leave things on credit because she runs the risk of someone not paying for them.  It's also really hard to get customers, because when someone makes a purchase, it may be a month or two before they come back for something else and she lands the client.  Juana wants to buy new merchandise, so whenever people come looking for new products, she'll have new containers, nicer styles than what she had before and she'll be able to close sales.  She says she'd rather buy in bulk because it's more profitable and it's better not to have to shop so often.  \r\n\r\nSometimes Juana's husband helps her sell products faster because he offers them to his friends at work.  She has four children, none of them grown.  The oldest is going into middle school.  Juana is thirty-two and has been married for thirteen years.  She lives in a rented house and her husband works.

His family consists of 7 members: five children who are 18, 16, 15, 12, and 5 years of age, all in school. The eldest studies and works as a secretary in the city of Santa Cruz. The family has rented a home in Ivirgarzama for 10 years. Juan has great projects planned, such as buying his own home, expanding his business, and helping his children develop their careers so that they may have better opportunities in the future. Juan has been repairing and selling spare parts for electronics for 10 years. He is well-experienced in this field. His business is located in Ivirgarzama on Leonardo Quispe Street. He likes the job he has chosen, and studied his trade in a vocational center. He was not able to obtain a college education due to his financial situation. Juan came to his present location from the city of Trinidad because he has more business and job opportunities in this tropical zone. <p>\r\nHe has little competition in this area because there are only about 10 repair centers for television sets, sound systems, DVDs, etc., so the demand is high in this tropical region. The high humidity in this area causes electronic devices to malfunction, so people must turn to technicians, which is favorable for Juan\u2019s business.  <p>\r\nJuan is requesting this loan to buy more spare parts for electronics and thus improve customer service. For example, customers come in to have their electronic devices repaired, and Juan sometimes doesn\u2019t have the necessary parts, which forces him to commute all the way to Cochabamba to get what he needs. This process not only wastes time, but also gives his business a bad reputation. <p>\r\nHe has already requested 3 loans from our institution, and has good credit history. Despite the fact that they were not sizeable, his prior loans have been of great use to him and his business projects. As a result, he has been able to improve his business and his credibility as a technician. He is a growing entrepreneur in our institution. <p>\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Spanish by Elizabeth Casian, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\nJuan tiene 36 a\u00f1os de edad, su familia esta compuesta por siete personas cinco hijos de 18,16,15,12 y 5 a\u00f1os de edad entre hombres y mujeres, todos estudian en el colegio, una de ellas que es la mayor estudia y trabaja como secretaria en la ciudad de Santa Cruz, viven en alquiler en la localidad de Ivirgarzama hace 10 a\u00f1os. <p>\r\nJuan tiene grandes proyectos tener una vivienda propia, un negocio mas grande y tambi\u00e9n de poder ver a sus hijos como profesionales para que tengan mayores oportunidades en el futuro. <p>\r\nJuan se dedica a la reparaci\u00f3n y venta de repuestos de artefactos el\u00e9ctricos hace mas de 10 a\u00f1os en la zona, tiene mucha experiencia en el rubro, esta ubicado en la localidad de Ivirgarzama sobre la calle Leonardo Quispe casi Av. Mortenson, le gusta el trabajo que emprendi\u00f3 en su vida, estudio para ello en un instituto de capacitaci\u00f3n, no tuvo oportunidad de entrar a la universidad por razones econ\u00f3micas. Juan migr\u00f3 de la ciudad de trinidad, porque en el tr\u00f3pico hay mayores oportunidades de trabajo y negocio. <p>\r\nLa competencia es menor en la localidad de Ivirgarzama ya que existen alrededor de 10 centros de reparaci\u00f3n de artefactos el\u00e9ctricos espec\u00edficamente televisores, equipos de m\u00fasica, DVDs y otros, la demanda es alta en la zona, porque la zona tropical los artefactos el\u00e9ctricos duran poco tiempo por varios factores sobre todo clima que es muy h\u00famedo, la poblaci\u00f3n necesariamente tiene  que acudir al t\u00e9cnico lo que es muy favorable para Juan David porque hace sostenible su negocio y sus ingresos. <p>\r\nJuan solicito este cr\u00e9dito para la compra de repuestos de aparatos el\u00e9ctricos, para mejorar la calidad de atenci\u00f3n al cliente, por ejemplo un cliente viene y solicita la reparaci\u00f3n y a veces Juan no tiene los repuestos necesarios para utilizarlos y necesariamente tiene que viajar a la ciudad de Cochabamba para traerlos cosa que demora mucho y puede representarle una mala imagen a su trabajo. <p>\r\n\u00c9l ya obtuvo varios cr\u00e9ditos con nuestra instituci\u00f3n, en una totalidad de 3 cr\u00e9ditos, con un cumplimiento bueno, a pesar del peque\u00f1o monto que solicito en sus anteriores operaciones, le sirvi\u00f3 mucho, resultado de est\u00e9 mejoro su trabajo y su imagen como t\u00e9cnico, es un cliente creciente en nuestra instituci\u00f3n.

sells lamb and alpaca at the Market 15 de Agosto. The idea came from her mother-in-law (who also is in the same business). She told her that it was very profitable business. She lives in the Yunguyo province. She joined the Wi\u00f1ay Marca Communal Bank where she obtained a first loan of $105 that she used to buy two more sheep. With this new loan of $725, which will be repaid over a period of 4 months, she will buy an average of 13 sheep, which will allow her to improve her income. Delia always makes her payments punctually to the communal bank. Delia is 27 years old; she is married and has two small children. With this loan, she hopes to sell her products in other markets like Tacna, La Paz \u2013 Bolivia, to be able to buy her house and that her children are able to go to school.\r\n<p><b>Translated from Spanish by Ana Gabriela Clark, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nDelia se dedica a la venta diaria de carne de ovino y alpaca en el mercado 15 de Agosto, la idea del comercio la dio su suegra (quien se dedica a la misma actividad), le coment\u00f3 que era muy rentable. Ella vive en el distrito y provincia de Yunguyo, Puno. La venta del producto era seguro por que ya tenia caseros diarios, es que se vio en la necesidad de buscar un cr\u00e9dito, motivo por el cual se asocio al Banco Comunal Wi\u00f1ay Marca, a un inicio fue acreedora de un cr\u00e9dito de S\/. 300.00 nuevos soles que lo invirti\u00f3 en la compra de dos corderos mas. Con este pr\u00e9stamo de S\/. 2000.00 nuevos soles, el cual ser\u00e1 cancelado en 4 cuotas, comprar\u00e1 un promedio de 13 ovinos, lo cual le permitir\u00e1 mejorar sus ingresos. Delia siempre paga sus intereses puntualmente al banco comunal. Delia tiene 27 a\u00f1os de edad, casada tiene dos hijos peque\u00f1os.

Latoya is requesting a loan from SPBD for the first time.  Latoya is now requesting a new loan of 1000 WST which will be used to purchase additional fabrics and materials.  Latoya plans to use the extra money she makes to improve and expand her business.\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD:\r\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\"\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":382968,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Tailoring","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to

Currently, they come to her house on a regular basis because they find all the items a housewife needs and because they receive the personal attention that she, herself, gives them with her characteristic good humor and charisma.  With this 1000 sol loan she will buy sacks of rice and sugar, cookies, pasta, packages of salt, cases of milk and preserved fish of various brands, flats of eggs and personal hygiene items to continue to provide excellent customer service.  Exsilda feels good to continue to work and is very grateful to the Manuela Ramos Movement for helping women like her to have the opportunity to develop in their areas of interest.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":467884,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To buy stock items for her store.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"San Mart\u00edn","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":72,"posted_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Exsilda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-12-12T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2010-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2010-03-12T08:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2010-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2010-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2010-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":166.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.51},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.49}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":125,"local_amount":333.34,"processed_date":"2010-02-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:43:42Z","rounded_local_amount":356.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123954387},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":166.67,"processed_date":"2010-03-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-23T07:54:19Z","rounded_local_amount":178.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128987408},{"amount":62.51,"local_amount":166.67,"processed_date":"2010-04-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-02T07:56:12Z","rounded_local_amount":178.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136713420},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":166.67,"processed_date":"2010-05-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-26T08:09:28Z","rounded_local_amount":178.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144746498},{"amount":62.49,"local_amount":166.65,"processed_date":"2010-06-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-27T07:48:57Z","rounded_local_amount":178.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151929720}],"funded_date":"2010-02-03T13:36:52Z","paid_date":"2010-07-27T07:48:57Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":171788,"name":"Irma","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Irma tiene 73 a\u00f1os su actividad econ\u00f3mica es venta de tortillas y cuajadas.

She has been in the coir making business for three years, which consists of extracting the fibers of a coconut to be woven together into different forms of rope or yarn, which can then be woven together to make products such as floor mats.\r\n\r\nRuchika is a hard-working woman who is very knowledgeable about her business. She is asking for a 30,000 LKR loan in order to purchase more raw materials in order to extract the coir. Eventually, in the future, she hopes to purchase a new coir machine with her profits.\r\n\r\nFor now, Ruchika hopes to expand and develop her business further as there is low competition in the area

She is married and has two school-aged children. To make a living, Gina owns and operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising livestock. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from raising pigs for fattening and sale. Gina has been engaged in her business for over 10 years and earns around 3,000 PHP whenever she sells her raised animal.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Gina joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Gina has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from ASKI. Gina is requesting a new loan of 7,000 PHP which will be used to purchase livestock feed and other supplies. This loan will be the second loan taken out by Gina from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay the tuition fees of her children. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 29 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She has been an embroiderer for more than 40 years and has her own workshop, in which she now works with her daughter. The experience has allowed her to make some beautiful embroidered patterns. It is a job that she enjoys for the calmness it gives her. She requires a great deal of concentration to complete every skirt, given the time it takes to add all the sequins and gold, silver and other coloured threads. Her customers buy her clothing with great satisfaction because they recognise the quality of her work. And it is for this reason that Betty would like to increase her output.

Maria de los Angeles is married and has three children.  She wants to expand her business and open a small store that is away from her house.  Since there are no other stores in the area, she wants to keep her business well-stocked so that she can generate the most income.  With this loan, she will buy soft drinks, soap, eggs, sugar, and other items.  Her goals for the future are to provide a better life for her children and support them so that they can become professionals.\r\n<p>\r\nSo far, Maria is happy to be with a group that knows how to respond to any situation that presents itself.  As a unit, the members are supportive of one another.  She thanks Kiva and Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad for trusting them again by providing a new loan.

She lives in Prk. Maligaya, Barangay Malingin, Bago City, Negros Occidental.  \r\n\r\nShe has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2005 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her general store and farming businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable.  She now earns an average income of PHP7,000. Ailen is now borrowing PHP 28,000 so that she can buy more fertilizer and inventory for the general store.  \r\n\r\nThis will be her 14th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP25,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey towards economic freedom. Ailen aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and to ensure their future well-being by following the  Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest

This is his sixth loan from MFP.  He knows that this loan will help him quite a bit in making progress in his business which is why he is prepared to make all his repayments on time.

It has produced famous thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. A civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged an already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural productivity and the manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent viable business prospects. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She lives in her own home with her husband, Felix who is 39 years old and their 4 beloved children who provide the drive for all of their efforts. The green fields of the Palmapampa town are located in a tropical jungle of the Ayacucho department; the area has made Eulalia\u2019s work life a very pleasant one. From a very young age her parents taught her to work the fields which she now does on her own land and works with a lot of care and sacrifice. Today she grows cocoa, coffee and plantains; she owns 4 hectares of land. What Eulalia enjoys most about her work is harvesting her fields since she feels that months of hard work give her the quality of her work. She has worked in this field for 15 years and says that the most difficult aspect of her work is hauling her crops from her Palmapampa community to the collecting centers in the city of San Francisco. Eulalia hopes in the future to get enough money to buy new land. This is her third loan with MFP and knows that she has a responsibility in paying all of her quotas on time and is willing to do it. In her communal bank, she is a member that provides order to the group. With the loan she will buy lumber to fence in the sides of her home since the previous wood is deteriorated.
