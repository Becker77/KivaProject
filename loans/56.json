She works out of her small house, making bags and clothes with a sewing machine that she bought with her first loan. She also knits and crochets different types of clothes as well. With this loan Ana will buy more materials and possibly a different sewing machine, which will enable her to make more complex things and hopefully in turn earn more money. With this increase in profit she hopes to expand her business and possibly have her own store someday that is separate from her house. She would like to be able to provide more for her family. \r\n<p>Note: Ana is one of five microentrepreneurs in her Bank of Hope solidarity group, all of whom have gone through Esperanza's business training courses.

This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.\r\n\r\nOne of the primary advantages of micro-leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":388486,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"To purchase clothes in bulk","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbeya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.9 33.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-09-15T17:10:18Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":700,"lender_count":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Emmy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":900000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2009-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2010-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2010-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":150000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":116.67},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":116.66},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":116.67},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":116.67},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.66},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":116.67,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2009-10-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T06:34:04Z","rounded_local_amount":152189.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97023049},{"amount":116.66,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:45:49Z","rounded_local_amount":152189.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103868290},{"amount":116.67,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2009-12-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T16:46:11Z","rounded_local_amount":152189.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110757486},{"amount":116.67,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2010-01-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:35:09Z","rounded_local_amount":152189.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118146580},{"amount":116.66,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T11:16:47Z","rounded_local_amount":152189.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123984725},{"amount":116.67,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2010-03-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-10T13:02:09Z","rounded_local_amount":152189.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":129015398}],"funded_date":"2009-09-17T03:04:16Z","paid_date":"2010-12-10T13:02:09Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jeff Avery","image":233371}},{"id":141105,"name":"Vilma","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Vilma S. is from the village of Northern Poblacion.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling personal home products to tourists and local community members.  \n\nIn 2009, Nuufou joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve  her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Nuufou is now requesting a new loan of 1000 WST which will be used to purchase raw materials needed to make products for sale.  The loan will be the 1st loan taken out by the borrower from SPBD.  Nuufou plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business  to improve the general living conditions of the borrower's family.\n\nAbout SPBD:\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.\n\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

He lives in his own home located in the central jungle of Peru. For 17 years he has driven an urban public transportation vehicle where he transports passengers within the city. On weekends he also takes some products with a small truck that he rents. Both activities, he indicates, are profitable and enable him to save as he wants to finish building his home in order to rent it. In addition he likes to work because it is tranquil. Now as the years have passed, he is sorry that he hadn\u2019t invested his money well, but for the future he plans to buy his own vehicle for work and teach his sons his profession.

She owns a business venture, planting & harvesting taro for sale.  Faaofo has many years of experience in this business.  Faaofo needs a loan of WST $3000 to purchase additional crops to raise.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 450 talas or US $188 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\n\nIn 2005, Faaofo joined SPBD.    This is her 5th loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Faaofo's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\n\nThe following social metrics for Faaofo M. are provided by SPBD*:\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.5 out of 3\nLevel of Education:                              1.4 out of 3\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.4 out of 3\nQuality of Household Assets:              1.5 out of 3\n\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress.  The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation.  A higher number represents a higher score.  For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.  \n\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\n\nAbout  SPBD \nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.  \n\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD

Vito, Sagay City.  She is married and has 4 school-aged children.  Roselyn owns & operates a fishing business, harvesting & selling ocean-caught fish in the local community. She has been engaged in this business for over 14 years and earns approximately 5,000 Php a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2005, Roselyn joined NWTF to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities.  She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 19,500 Php from NWTF. She is now requesting a new loan of 19,500 Php which will be used to purchase fishing equipment such as hooks & nets. The loan will be the 9th loan taken out by Roselyn from NWTF. She plans to use the additional revenue generated to pay her children's tuition fees.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress out of earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":517102,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish

They are involved in different activities such as trade, sales, production and services.  \r\n\r\nMrs. Mariela has been active in this Bank for three years and is very happy to have gotten involved because of all the help she has received from the Espoir Foundation and the communal bank.

All\u00ed fue logrando poco a poco experiencia y posteriormente agreg\u00f3 a este negocio trabajos por computador, producto tambi\u00e9n de que Maira,  le hacia los trabajos a sus compa\u00f1eros de estudios en un quipo de su hermana y ellos le pagaban por esto.  Cuando fue adquiriendo mas pericia compr\u00f3 su propio equipo y con una amiga emprendi\u00f3 un negocio en otro municipio del Atl\u00e1ntico, donde duraron 3 a\u00f1os; como ella simult\u00e1neamente trabajaba en una empresa y hacia turnos, no pudo continuar con este negocio y lo abandon\u00f3, hasta que dos a\u00f1os despu\u00e9s, dej\u00f3 de ser empleada continu\u00f3 con su negocio y en el lleva dos a\u00f1os hasta hoy y ha incluido mercanc\u00edas variadas y jugueter\u00eda, pues tambi\u00e9n participa vendiendo  en la feria del juguete, apoyada por su madre y su hermana. Con su negocio Maira se ha sentido satisfecha y su deseo de crecer como emprendedora es inmenso, por eso se ha acercado a ala Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, para apoyarse con un capital de trabajo mediante su primer credikiva, con el que comprar\u00e1 jugueter\u00eda  que vender\u00e1 y se dar\u00e1 el gusto de ver a los ni\u00f1os muy alegres en la \u00e9poca en la cual les pone regalos el ni\u00f1o Dios. Esta es la raz\u00f3n de su financiamiento y con \u00e9l tendr\u00e1 \u00e9xito, no solo por su experiencia, sino tambi\u00e9n porque su inversi\u00f3n est\u00e1 basada   en art\u00edculos, que le han solicitado sus clientes a quienes quiere complacer para conservarlos siempre fieles.\n","en":"Maira is 28 years old and is an entrepreneur. She owns a business selling varied merchandise and also offers telephone and Internet services. She is located in a commercial part of the neighborhood where she lives, and whose qualities make it a great place in regards to potential customers because it is surrounded by homes where people live, there are banks, shopping centers, schools and recreational areas and open spaces and sports fields used also for carnival participants at different times and special events of the city.\r\n\r\nHer idea of a business began when she began her studies and a friend loaned her some cell phone minutes from his plan with which she procured income and was able to pay for her transport fares to go to the educational center where she studied.\r\n\r\nThere she was getting experience little by little and later she added the business of equipment, another venture Maira has. She did some work with her schoolmates on a machine her sister had and they were paid for this. As she gained more experience she bought her own equipment and with a friend she opened a business in another town on the Atlantic, which lasted three years. At the same time she worked in a business on shifts, but she could not continue in this work and quit. Two years later, because of her continuous employment in her work and in the two years until today and having included a variety of goods and toys, she also sells at the toy marketplace, helped by her mother and her sister.\r\n\r\nMaira has been feeling satisfied with this business and her desire to grow as a entrepreneur is immense and this is why she has put herself under the wing of Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, in order to have working capital through her first Kiva loan which she would use to buy and to sell toys for the pleasure of seeing the very happy children at the time in which presents of the baby Jesus are given. This is the reason for her loan and with it she will succeed, not only because of her experience, but also because her investment is based on items that her customers have been asking for and who she wants to satisfy to keep them always faithful.

Her main activity is cereal and yam trading. She is married and in charge of six (06) children and contributes at least 75 % of household expenses as the meager pension of her husband which is paid with months of delay is very insufficient to cover the needs of the family. Very dynamic, she substitutes with that trade, the selling of cooked yams which she sells in the market of Adidogom\u00e9. Though, she is illiterate, she has a rigorous sense of management. Her first credits were paid promptly paid back and without any incident; this makes her a woman deserving of trust. \r\n\r\nSo, the credit of $ 850 she requested will allow her to travel to the production areas and make important storage of maize, beans, yam, etc. Granting her financial support is contributing to increasing the volume and profitability of the activities thereby improving her living condition and that of her family.\r\n\r\n<p> \r\n\r\nMadame A.

Once a week Jalil travels to the neighboring city Istaravshan to purchase new goods to sell. His younger son (who is pictured in the photo) helps Jalil with the business. Jalil and his son are very polite and open people by nature, and this helps them in their business. For 10 years he has managed to have great clientele. Jalil\u2018s business is stable and brings the main income, allowing his family to improve their living conditions and make their plans for the future. This year is very important for Jalil as he is going to arrange the marriage of his elder son. For this reason he wants to increase the range of his goods.

Home Economics Primary school in Makeni, northern Sierra Leone. B.D.E.C Home Economics Primary school was founded by Mrs. Rodger K. S. to assist the children of Makeni and its environs, teaching \"the art of managing the home and thyself\". The school is staffed with twelve teachers, all of whom are female.<P>\r\n\r\nThey teach pupils who are already in classes five and six from all schools in Makeni and beyond. Each school in town will bring their pupils to B.D.E.C Home Economics on a fixed day of the week for lessons. Among the subjects they teach are: home management; child care; Family and Life Education (F.L.E.); agriculture; clothing and textiles; food and nutrition, and so on. <P>\r\n\r\nThe school is proud that pupils writing the subjects they teach always come with good grades on the National Primary School Exams (N.P.S.E). Since the school caters for pupils from all primary schools in Makeni and beyond, space has become their great challenge \u2013  they only have one building of about six classrooms. To add to their problems, the only toilet they had has been stolen. They are now looking to the government to buy them another, a process that might take donkey\u2019s years.<P>\r\n\r\nThis is the first loan B.D.EC Home Economics is borrowing from SMT (through Kiva). With this loan, they will be able to do something meaningful. Gradually, they will repay it out of their meager monthly salaries. Teachers are among the lowest paid workers in Sierra Leone, and with such small salaries, they could not do or buy anything big. With a loan, some of them can buy pieces of furniture;  some will pay either their children\u2019s school fees or pay for themselves to pursue further studies; others will use their share of the loan to either start building a house or to complete the building process; and others will use theirs in business to supplement their monthly salaries. <P>\r\n\r\nAlen F.

She owns a business venture, planting & harvesting taro for sale.  Eseta has 1 year of experience in this business.  Eseta needs a loan of WST $1000 to purchase additional seeds, seedlings & young crops to raise.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 450 talas or US $188 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nYou can view pictures of a typical plantation in Samoa, taken by a Kiva Fellow, at:   http:\/\/picasaweb.google.com\/agnes.p.chu\/SamoanPlantation\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Eseta joined SPBD.    This is her 1st loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Eseta's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Eseta S. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.4 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.6 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              1.65 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

Daan Lungsod, Medellin, Cebu. She earns her living by operating two business ventures: Pig Fattening and Fishing businesses. Her husband Arnel E., who is 39 years old, works as a carpenter to earn his living. They have 4 children who are 8 to 17 years old with two of them already working while the other two are currently going to school.\r\n\r\n Cristina joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2005 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past nine loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Cristina has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 19,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 11,800, thus uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 10th loan, she is borrowing PHP 20,000 which she intends to use as additional working capital so that she can continue to save up for the future education of her children. \r\n\r\nCristina E. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams.   \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\n\r\n In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed on  a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Her husband, Mario, who is 45 years old, works as a farmer to earn his living. They have three children who are between 18 and 24 years old. \r\n\r\nSusana earns her living by operating a general store\r\n. \r\nSusana joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2009 because she aspired to something better for her family. With the help of her past two loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Susana has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 6,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 10,000, uplifting the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her third loan, she is borrowing PHP 10,000, with which she intends to buy stocks of goods for the store to sell so that she can continue to save up for future improvements to her house and for the education of her children. \r\n\r\nSusana is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means \"honorable\"). NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon, a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Since 2009, he has owned a business called \u201cTienda El Paisa\u201d where he sells snacks, food, liquor, soft drinks, and products used for preparing family meals.  He conducts mainly cash sales, but he extends credit to his most loyal customers.  When he started his business, Joel only sold vegetables using capital that he borrowed from his sister.  Using his home as his business location, Joel allocated his operating capital toward the sale of vegetables.  He gradually added other products that are consumed by families who live in his neighborhood and the surrounding areas.  His goal for the future is to stabilize his business and convert it into a larger store that offers a diversity of products that his customers need.  \r\n<p>\r\nJoel is applying for a Kiva loan, his first form of financing through Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  He will use the money to buy food products, vegetables, and household goods in large volumes so that he can have a well-stocked business.  By purchasing these goods with cash, he will be able to receive discounts.  His greatest challenge is not having enough capital to respond quickly to his customers by acquiring the products that they purchase the most.  He will be able to accomplish this using his Kiva loan.  \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":856500,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy food products, vegetables, and household goods in large volumes.

She lives in rented accomodation with her husband Sime\u00f3n, 33 years old, and their 3 children,. What she most wants is to give her children a good future. Reyna, with her husband, opened a car parts store as they saw that it was a profitable business that would cover their household costs. Her main customers are haulers who at times need spare parts for their trucks. The people who know her, without doubt, go to Reyna's spare parts store as they can find everything they need there. What she likes the best about the work is that she can be with the family without neglecting the business. She has been in the business for 4 years and believes that the most difficult thing is when she runs out of spare parts they normally stock. In the future she plans on buying more car spare parts so as not to look bad with her regular customers. This will be her 5th loan with MFP.

SELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through micro-leasing whereby SELFINA buys and leases equipment to women. Specifically, when a client needs working capital, SELFINA will purchase equipment from said client, extend a loan to her, and then lease the same equipment back to her \u2013 a process called a sale and leaseback arrangement. Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets; therefore, financial institutions do not consider Tanzanian women to be credit-worthy because they lack tangible assets that could serve as collateral. As a result, Tanzanian women with low income receive poor financial support and meager access to basic needs and services. SELFINA thanks you for your support."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":123257,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing

Sophia thanks you for your support!\r\n\r\n<strong>About the field partner:<\/strong>\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through micro-leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through a leasing and payback microfinance facility.

So Evelyn thought of a way to help her husband, and this was the start of her frozen foods business. They are blessed with three children: Kevin Ray, 17 years old; Kenneth Jim, 14 years old, and Karl Brian, 12 years old. All of their children are now in school so educational expenses are high. \r\n\r\nEvelyn got her capital for starting a business from a loan she received from Kiva's field partner, Ahon sa Hirap, Inc. (ASHI), when she became a member. Now she has been in her business for four years, and her business continues to grow, because she makes good use of every loan she receives from ASHI. She will be using her seventh loan to buy different frozen foods to sell so that her business will continue to improve.\r\n\r\nJust like every parent dreams for their children, Evelyn also dreams of her children finishing their studies until college.

A. is from the village of Lugait, Misamis Oriental. She is 43 years old. Linda is married and has three school-aged children. To make a living, Linda owns and operates a business in the retail sector--a sari-sari (variety) retail shop. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling both food and daily-use products in the local community. Linda has been engaged in her business for over a year and earns approximately 5000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Linda joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Linda has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional products to sell. Linda is requesting a new loan of 7000 PHP, which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This loan will be the second loan taken out by Linda from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, we created this template for our field staff to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":448125,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

They live in the city of Cuenca. This city was declared a World Heritage Site on the December 1, 1999, for its architectural beauty and the four rivers that flow through the city. Its people are what make it special because they are polite and kind.\n\nSra. Rosa Silvana L. lives in the city of Cuenca. She is in her fourth loan cycle. Her mother invited her to be part of this group of hard-working women. The loans have benefited her in the raising of chickens, which she raises as an equal partner with her mother.

She is 20 years old and lives in with her common law husband. She is happy because she is in her fifth month of pregnancy with her first child. She lives in the house of her parents, whom she helps economically since her parents do not have their own home and are renting one. She will invest her new loan from Fundaci\u00f3n Espoir in the purchase of chickens to sell to obtain income for her family. She wants to continue studying at the university and some day to be a medical professional, since that has been her dream since she was a girl.\n\nThis is the first loan for Se\u00f1ora Laura M.. She was invited by her sister, who is also a member of this foundation. She lives in the city of Cuenca, in the Three Bridges district. At this time she is raising guinea pigs, which she sells from her house. In the past, she sewed jeans, but unfortunately she could not continue working because of the stress. Sra. Laura is 52 years old. She has been a widow for 21 years. Her husband died of cancer. She has 6 children. Four of them are married and live independently. One daughter emigrated to another country, but she does not receive any help from her. Her last son works, and everything he earns goes to pay his own expenses.

L. has been engaged in this business for over 10 years and earns approximately 3,000,000 VND a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, L. joined SEDA to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. L. has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,152,000 VND from SEDA. This previous loan was used to purchase baby livestock to raise and sell in the future. She is now requesting a new loan of 7,392,000 VND, which will be used to purchase livestock feed and other supplies. The loan will be the 4th loan taken out by the borrower from SEDA. L. plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business.\r\n\r\nAbout the Other Borrowers in the Group:\r\n\r\n1.  Ho\u00e0ng Th\u1ecb C.

He is a native of Monteria, an agricultural area of Colombia.  He moved to the town of Soledad with high hopes, but he couldn't find a job.  He worked as an assistant at a friend's store and used the experience he gained there to start his own business.  He has operated the business for 10 years now, but only bought it outright 1 year ago.  This is Harold's second Fundacion Mario Santo Domingo loan, a loan that he will use to buy larger volumes of the meats and cold drinks that his customers will want for year-end parties.  Harold has been able to use his connection with the bank to learn new business skills and legalize his business.  His greatest hope is to save enough money to buy the building where he operates the business because, for now, he's only renting space.  He also wants to continue his accounting studies and he is planning to take out another Fundacion Mario Santo Domingo loan to pay for it.\r\n     \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jere Wiseman, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":850,"image":{"id":602048,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Buy products to resell.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Soledad Atl\u00e0ntico","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2010-09-17T22:50:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":850,"lender_count":27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Harold Luis","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-09-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":127930},{"due_date":"2010-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":139965},{"due_date":"2011-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":142648},{"due_date":"2011-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":145382},{"due_date":"2011-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":148168},{"due_date":"2011-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":151008},{"due_date":"2011-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":153902},{"due_date":"2011-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":156852},{"due_date":"2011-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":159859},{"due_date":"2011-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":174286}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.49},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.32},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":80.83},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.38},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.97},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.57},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.21},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":88.88},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.59},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":98.76}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":151.81,"local_amount":267895,"processed_date":"2010-12-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T13:13:55Z","rounded_local_amount":274197.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188688338},{"amount":80.83,"local_amount":142648,"processed_date":"2011-01-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T03:38:34Z","rounded_local_amount":146003.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191427561},{"amount":82.38,"local_amount":145382,"processed_date":"2011-02-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-16T08:39:42Z","rounded_local_amount":148802.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":196000979},{"amount":83.97,"local_amount":148168,"processed_date":"2011-03-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:08:01Z","rounded_local_amount":151653.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201288985},{"amount":85.57,"local_amount":151008,"processed_date":"2011-04-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:03:58Z","rounded_local_amount":154560.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206157138},{"amount":87.21,"local_amount":153902,"processed_date":"2011-05-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:17:36Z","rounded_local_amount":157522.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211230147},{"amount":88.88,"local_amount":156852,"processed_date":"2011-06-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:08:37Z","rounded_local_amount":160541.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216509021},{"amount":90.59,"local_amount":159859,"processed_date":"2011-07-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:48:56Z","rounded_local_amount":163619.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221673252},{"amount":98.76,"local_amount":174286,"processed_date":"2011-08-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-17T08:00:49Z","rounded_local_amount":178386.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227319816}],"funded_date":"2010-09-18T03:10:14Z","paid_date":"2011-09-17T08:00:49Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jere Wiseman","image":30736}},{"id":236165,"name":"Sonia Carolina","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Sonia Carolina L.

She plans to use the profit from her business (estimated to be 450 WST or US $188 per week) to supplement her family's income.\r\n\r\nTavau joined SPBD to gain access to financial services.  Most of SPBD's clients are unable to borrow from commercial banks because they lack collateral. This is Tavau's 2nd loan with SPBD. \r\n\r\n*SPBD evaluates the living conditions of each of its borrowers.  Generally, a loan manager evaluates a variety of social metrics on a scale out of 3 (the higher the number, the better off the person is) and these are averaged for the \"overall social metric score.\"  For example, a 3 out of 3 on \"level of education\" would mean that the borrower has graduated from university.  \r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.

Ica is located in the Sechura desert approximately four hours south of Lima, the country's capitol, and it is hailed by Peruvians as \"La Tierra del Sol\" which means \"The Land of the Sun.\"  It is known in Per\u00fa for its frequent earthquakes (an 8.0 in 2007 and a 6.7 in 2011), its production of grapes, asparagus, and olives, and perhaps most of all, for being the source of the traditional drink of Per\u00fa, Pisco.  In this warm and arid climate, you find Ivonne's house and business.  She is the mother of a 9 year old, who is in fourth grade in school; her favorite dish is chicken and rice, which is characterized by a dressing consisting of spices like cilantro in which the chicken is cooked, giving it a nice flavor.  \r\n\r\nIvonne enjoys her free time reading and listening to music.  Due to the fact that she did not have enough economic resources, she was only able to finish high school though she would have loved to be a kindergarten teacher.  Ivonne currently makes a living growing cotton on her lot of land, and her husband works on his motorcycle taxi, with which he transports passengers through the neighborhood where they live.  He works approximately four hours a day and with this work he helps a lot with the household costs.  He can earn about 70 soles (or about 26 dollars) per day, and on a good day he can earn about 90 soles (about 33 dollars), and with these extra earnings he can help with additional household costs.  Since there is not much agricultural production at present nor much earning for that work, Ivonne believes that her husband is well-received and that there is a great necessity for people to get from here to there.  The person who encouraged her husband to get into this work was his father, who motivated him to purchase a motorcycle taxi.  \r\n\r\nIvonne is grateful to those who loan through Kiva because with this support being given, they will be able to provide general maintenance for her husband's motorcycle and have more customers.  This will improve the earnings for the household, providing a better quality of life for her family and allowing them to purchase another motorcycle taxi which will make it possible to achieve their dream within several months: to have a cotton exportation business."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1125,"image":{"id":963273,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Transportation","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"to

This is Aisha K., a 28-year-old woman from Mwanza. She is single and has two children, who are 5 and 8 years old, respectively. <p>\r\n \r\nAisha has been running a tailoring business since 2006. Indeed, she purchases vitambaa (materials), vitenge (traditional Tanzanian clothes with wax prints), and kanga (printed cotton fabrics, often with borders along all four sides) and makes them into clothing, primarily for women. She works at her business 12 hours per day and 6 days per week, though she is assisted by one employee. By doing so, Aisha is able to earn approximately $295 per month from her business operations. She is now requesting a loan in the amount of $425 in order to buy additional vitambaas, vitenges, and kangas. In the future, she plans to add even more clothes to her inventory. Aisha thanks you for her support! <p>\r\n\r\nABOUT SELFINA: SELFINA is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback micro-finance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are not considered to be credit-worthy by financial institutions because they lack tangible assets that can serve as collateral. As such, low income women in Tanzania typically receive poor financial support and in turn only limited access to basic needs and services. Fortunately, SELFINA has been a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through micro-leasing to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women in Tanzania. Simply put, SELFINA buys and leases equipment to women through an arrangement called a sale and leaseback transaction. More specifically, when a client needs working capital, SELFINA buys equipment from said client, extends a loan to her to facilitate the transaction, and then leases the equipment back to her. As such, one of the primary advantages of micro-leasing is that it allows clients to use their equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":239648,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Tailoring","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"To expand her business by purchasing additional materials, clothes, and fabrics ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mwanza","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.516667 32.9","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-12-16T19:40:36Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Aisha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-15T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":85},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":85},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":85,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-02-14T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:02:44Z","rounded_local_amount":105400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20436339},{"amount":85,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:55:17Z","rounded_local_amount":105400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130611},{"amount":85,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-04-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:23:28Z","rounded_local_amount":105400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027408},{"amount":85,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-05-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:13:14Z","rounded_local_amount":105400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613409},{"amount":85,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-06-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:01:13Z","rounded_local_amount":105400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010489}],"funded_date":"2008-12-16T21:17:45Z","paid_date":"2009-07-16T00:01:13Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Craig Kaufman","image":null}},{"id":83745,"name":"Aurea","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Aurea is a member of the Suni (\u201cStrength\u201d in Quechua) Village Bank.

is a married woman who lives alone and works hard for the good of her three children. The  training she has given her children allows her to count on their strong support in working the fields. Zulfiya\u2019s children\u2019s grateful attitude continues to encourage her, and they have gathered many lessons during this time that they will use when they form their own households. What Zulfiya urgently needs right now are fertilizers and other chemicals for the care of their crops, so that they can produce a product that meets the demands of the market. Zulfiya doesn\u2019t just need good land; she also needs a friendly hand to help her out.  \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and with it\u2019s famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

","en":"Saidniso is a woman who has been a borrower since 2007.  When she started her business her working capital was not large.  Today, her working capital has increased several times over.  This is the result of her using credit to grow her business.  Saidniso lives in Chkalovsk and sells at the Chkalovsk market.  She brings her products from Bishkek herself twice a month.  In parallel to improvements in her business her family situation has improved.  Her husband works at a factory as a specialist-mechanic, but his salary is not enough for a full, good lifestyle.  This is why Saidniso helps him by sitting and selling everyday at the market.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Russian by Sabina Holzman, Kiva

He is a hard-working young man who responsibly faces the challenges that life presents.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":436744,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Transportation","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"For mototaxi maintenance.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ucupe - Lagunas - Chiclayo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":143,"posted_date":"2009-12-01T08:01:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":175,"lender_count":4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Manuel Alonzo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-11-20T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":42.79},{"due_date":"2010-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":44.71},{"due_date":"2010-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":44.81},{"due_date":"2010-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":48.39},{"due_date":"2010-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":49.5},{"due_date":"2010-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":50.76},{"due_date":"2010-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":51.92},{"due_date":"2010-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":54.24},{"due_date":"2010-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":55.7},{"due_date":"2010-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":57.18}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":14.98},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15.65},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.68},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.94},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.32},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.77},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.17},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.98},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.5},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.01}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":14.98,"local_amount":42.79,"processed_date":"2009-12-21T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T12:48:31Z","rounded_local_amount":43.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110669673},{"amount":15.65,"local_amount":44.71,"processed_date":"2010-01-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:16:07Z","rounded_local_amount":45.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118065174},{"amount":15.68,"local_amount":44.81,"processed_date":"2010-02-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T09:47:20Z","rounded_local_amount":45.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123900275},{"amount":16.94,"local_amount":48.39,"processed_date":"2010-03-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T08:45:33Z","rounded_local_amount":48.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128934429},{"amount":17.32,"local_amount":49.5,"processed_date":"2010-04-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:08:57Z","rounded_local_amount":49.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136662045},{"amount":17.77,"local_amount":50.76,"processed_date":"2010-05-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:07:02Z","rounded_local_amount":51.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144694752},{"amount":18.17,"local_amount":51.92,"processed_date":"2010-06-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:38:15Z","rounded_local_amount":52.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151877808},{"amount":18.98,"local_amount":54.24,"processed_date":"2010-07-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T10:50:31Z","rounded_local_amount":54.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159617855},{"amount":19.5,"local_amount":55.7,"processed_date":"2010-08-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:01:36Z","rounded_local_amount":56.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166832264},{"amount":20.01,"local_amount":57.18,"processed_date":"2010-09-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T09:56:28Z","rounded_local_amount":57.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172098888}],"funded_date":"2009-12-02T04:27:50Z","paid_date":"2010-10-15T09:56:28Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":161822,"name":"St. Theresa Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Belinda is twenty\u2013two years old.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Enclaro, Binalbagan, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating 2 business ventures: a general store and a tailoring business. Her husband Franco, who is 58 years old, works as a fisherman to earn his living, and also helps in his wife's business activities.  They have 5 children who are between 27 to 33 years old. \r\n\r\nVirginia joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1999 because she aspired to something better for her family. With the help of her past 13 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Virginia has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 18,000 Philippine pesos (PHP) helped her earn a monthly profit of 6,000 PHP, increasing the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 14th loan, she is borrowing 19,000 PHP, which she intends to use to pay for a new sewing machine and inventory for the general store. She wants to continue to save up for future home repairs and other uses. \r\n\r\nVirginia C. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

It is the main source of income for Ibeth and her children, who are between 2 and 19 years old.  She started the business after spending many years making handicrafts, which is an intrinsic part of the area's culture.  She started Tienda Andrea because she was offered a lease on a shop.  With her effort and her family's support, Ibeth opened this shop, where she sells provisions, food, drinks, canned goods, dried meat, and articles of daily use.  Her main clients are housewives living nearby, to whom Ibeth sells in small quantities so that they can afford it.

This business has been in operation for the last nine years and is the main source of income for her family. However, Jane's earnings from the business are not enough to meet her family\u2019s increasing needs. Overall, her business is doing well, since she has plenty of regular customers. The demand for her charcoal is high, because this is the commonly used fuel in the slum. The fruits and vegetables, too, sell quite well. Also, the water-vending business is successful, since many residents do not have tap water at their homes. Still, Jane would like to increase her earnings to be able to provide all the necessities for her family. To achieve this, she intends to expand the scope of her business operations. She wants to open up more water taps and increase the stock of fruit, vegetables and charcoal. Jane is requesting a loan of US$1000: US$250 for buying and installing two water meters and pipes, and US$750 for purchasing more charcoal, vegetables and fruits.

Thi Tua is now 49 years old. After 3 years, she realises that by joining the Fund, family members and herself are more hardworking and daring to do business. Her family has a butcher shop selling pork in the wet market. Her husband is the butcher while she is the seller in the market. On average, everyday her family butchers and sells one 60kg pig. During special occasions such as the New Year, her family butchers and sells more: 2 to 3 pigs. Her family is well-known in this business as they have many years of experience in butchering. the villagers always sell pigs to her family whenever they have pigs that are old enough. Her family's income is, therefore, improving. She has two school-going children. Her wish is that she can expand her business to offer duck and dog meat to meet the customers' demand. This time, she wants to borrow 9 millions VND (550USD) to invest in the butcher shop. Her family's average monthly income is 5 millions VND (about 322USD).\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Vietnamese by Pham Yen Thanh, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\nTham gia v\u00e0o Qu\u1ef9 n\u0103m 2006 ch\u1ecb Nguy\u1ec5n Th\u1ecb T\u1ef1a 49 tu\u1ed5i, tr\u1ea3i qua 3 n\u0103m vay v\u1ed1n c\u1ee7a Qu\u1ef9 ch\u1ecb nh\u1eadn th\u1ea5y r\u1eb1ng vi\u1ec7c tham gia v\u00e0o Qu\u1ef9 b\u1ea3n th\u00e2n ch\u1ecb c\u00f9ng c\u00e1c th\u00e0nh vi\u00ean trong gia \u0111\u00ecnh ch\u1ecb \u0111\u00e3 m\u1ea1nh d\u1ea1n l\u00e0m kinh t\u1ebf v\u00e0 m\u1ecdi ng\u01b0\u1eddi \u0111\u1ec1u c\u1ed1 g\u1eafng h\u01a1n, gia \u0111\u00ecnh ch\u1ecb l\u00e0m ng\u1ec1 th\u1ecbt l\u1ee3n b\u00e1n ta\u1ecb ch\u1ee3, ch\u1ed3ng ch\u1ecb l\u00e0 ng\u01b0\u1eddi \u0111i m\u1ed5 l\u1ee3n c\u00f2n ch\u1ecb l\u00e0 ng\u01b0\u1eddi \u0111i b\u00e1n tr\u1ef1c ti\u1ebfp t\u1ea1i ch\u1ee3, b\u00ecnh qu\u00e2n m\u1ed5i ng\u00e0y gia \u0111\u00ecnh ch\u1ecb th\u1ecbt 1 con l\u1ee3n kho\u1ea3ng 60kg, Nh\u1eefng ng\u00e0y t\u1ebft, d\u1eb1m gia \u0111\u00ecnh ch\u1ecb th\u1ecbt nhi\u1ec1u h\u01a1n t\u1eeb 2->3 con, c\u00f3 nhi\u1ec1u n\u0103m  kinh nghi\u1ec7m trong ngh\u1ec1 n\u00ean gia \u0111\u00ecnh anh ch\u1ecb r\u1ea5t c\u00f3 uy t\u00edn trong l\u00e0m \u0103n, ng\u01b0\u1eddi d\u00e2n trong \u0111\u1ecba ph\u01b0\u01a1ng khi c\u1ea7n xu\u1ea5t l\u1ee3n l\u1ea1i b\u00e1n cho gia \u0111\u00ecnh ch\u1ecb.

He has four children whose names are Sara Rymunda Bracamonte, who is 26 and in her 5th year of studying law, Salvador Alexander who is 23 and works with his father, Julio Cesar who is 20 and in his first year studying industrial engineering, and Leticia del Carmen who is 19 and doesn't study since she is a single mother.  His wife is Maria Else Bracamonte who works teaching elementary school at the Modesto Armijo de Subtiava school.  Jose would like to have a pottery workshop that is more technical which will help to finance his children's studies which he has been able to do up till now with great effort.\r\n\r\nHis business is located in his home in the Sutiava neighborhood.  He has run his pottery workshop for the past 20 years; he took a pottery class while he was working as an educator and he loved it so he decided to start his own workshop which now is the source of the majority of his income.  Through the class, he also met his wife.  Prior to starting his shop, he taught children with disabilities or those that suffer from Down syndrome; but in 1985, he quit his job as a professor because the pay was insufficient to support his family.  He decided to work on his own in his pottery shop.  He will use this loan to finance his business by purchasing more clay, sand, and dirt.  He primarily sells flowerpots, windowboxes, and ceramic plates and cups.  By improving his workshop, he would eventually like to export his goods.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Scott Crandall, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":217931,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"Capital for his business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Leon","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.435556 -86.879444","type":"point"}},"partner_id":96,"posted_date":"2008-11-07T19:20:16Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":450,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jose Pedro","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-11-21T22:31:34Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":8500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":850},{"due_date":"2009-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":850},{"due_date":"2009-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":850},{"due_date":"2009-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":850},{"due_date":"2009-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":850},{"due_date":"2009-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":850},{"due_date":"2009-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":850},{"due_date":"2009-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":850},{"due_date":"2009-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":850},{"due_date":"2009-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":850}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":45,"local_amount":850,"processed_date":"2008-12-21T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-15T22:23:55Z","rounded_local_amount":886.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9935103},{"amount":45,"local_amount":850,"processed_date":"2009-01-21T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T12:37:19Z","rounded_local_amount":886.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14858600},{"amount":45,"local_amount":850,"processed_date":"2009-02-21T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T08:41:40Z","rounded_local_amount":886.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20399858},{"amount":45,"local_amount":850,"processed_date":"2009-03-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T18:36:27Z","rounded_local_amount":886.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27091841},{"amount":44.99,"local_amount":850,"processed_date":"2009-04-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T16:39:33Z","rounded_local_amount":886.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35985248},{"amount":45,"local_amount":850,"processed_date":"2009-05-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T23:10:36Z","rounded_local_amount":886.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44445857},{"amount":45,"local_amount":850,"processed_date":"2009-06-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T20:40:11Z","rounded_local_amount":886.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52956510},{"amount":45.01,"local_amount":850,"processed_date":"2009-07-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T13:59:08Z","rounded_local_amount":886.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63173942},{"amount":45,"local_amount":850,"processed_date":"2009-08-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T15:29:52Z","rounded_local_amount":886.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73599637},{"amount":45,"local_amount":850,"processed_date":"2009-09-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T17:57:05Z","rounded_local_amount":886.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87035535}],"funded_date":"2008-11-07T22:31:34Z","paid_date":"2009-10-15T17:57:05Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Scott Crandall","image":163705}},{"id":75569,"name":"Mary","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mary T. is a 44-year-old married woman with two children, both of whom are in school.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

She owns a business venture, catching & selling ocean-caught fish .  Faaiu has 3 years of experience in this business.  Faaiu needs a loan of WST $1300 to purchase fishing equipment including hooks & nets.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 600 talas or US $250 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Faaiu joined SPBD.    This is her 2nd loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Faaiu's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Faaiu P. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.6 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.7 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2.3 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

He began working in a cement factory four years ago where he saw that selling cement was a good business and entrypoint. Currently, he buys and sells cement from the factory since they give him a lower price and he sells it for two bolivianos more. In this way he gains life to bring bread home every day.

While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is 'Shine'.\r\n\r\nMaura is married and has one school-aged child. To make a living, Maura owns & operates a specialized retail store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from selling seafood products  including fish and shrimp in the local community. Maura has been engaged in her business for over 10 years and earns approximately 2800 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Maura joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Maura is requesting a loan of 3000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This  will be the first loan taken out by Maura from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement the family's income. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three unit offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

What Lucinda most likes about her work is cultivating her land because she feels that she is putting it to good use.

Jorge is 27 years old.  He requests a loan to invest in his business selling eggs at wholesale and retail. He makes his sales from his house, and also in an itinerant manner.  He has had this business for 6 years.  Mariela is 28 years old and has a business selling handicrafts.  She buys her products in the market and sells from place to place.  She started up this business 2 years ago; her relatives helped her  by contributing the startup capital so that she could get the business going.  She also received help from other merchants who had experience in this line of work.  Ana Patricia has a business selling nacatamales (a traditional Nicaraguan tamal), beans and soup.  Her menu varies daily in order to accommodate the demands of her customers.  Her main challenge is to buy equipment for the business.  At this time, she does not have this equipment and so she uses utensils from her house.  She started this business with the help of her father, who set aside working capital so that she would be able to work and get ahead, since in this country it is difficult to find work.  Francisco has a business selling eggs from place to place, and also from his house.  He requests this new loan to invest in his business and stock it with more eggs; the loan will also allow him to make a big purchase and obtain a discount that he could not get if he buys the eggs at retail. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":825,"image":{"id":895297,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy eggs","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Leon","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.435556 -86.879444","type":"point"}},"partner_id":96,"posted_date":"2011-10-15T21:10:13Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":825,"lender_count":30,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jorge Luis","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mariela De Los Angeles","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ana Patricia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Francisco Filadelfo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":18500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":825,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-04T07:00:00Z","amount":3083.33},{"due_date":"2011-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":3083.33},{"due_date":"2012-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":3083.33},{"due_date":"2012-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":3083.33},{"due_date":"2012-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":3083.33},{"due_date":"2012-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":3083.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":137.5,"local_amount":3083.38,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:55:36Z","rounded_local_amount":3126.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244566394},{"amount":150.95,"local_amount":3384.9,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-21T08:53:31Z","rounded_local_amount":3431.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":251670227},{"amount":138.63,"local_amount":3108.7,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-17T09:01:59Z","rounded_local_amount":3151.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257564003},{"amount":140.13,"local_amount":3142.28,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:32:27Z","rounded_local_amount":3185.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263322160},{"amount":142.27,"local_amount":3190.24,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T09:28:37Z","rounded_local_amount":3234.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270036421},{"amount":115.52,"local_amount":2590.5,"processed_date":"2012-04-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:39:10Z","rounded_local_amount":2626.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276648599}],"funded_date":"2011-10-21T21:11:48Z","paid_date":"2012-05-15T09:39:10Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lisa Grobar","image":264298}},{"id":350975,"name":"Grace","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Grace is 41 years old and is married to Michael.
