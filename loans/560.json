She now plans to develop her own clothing line to market to stores in the area.  In order to do this, she plans to expand her sewing workshop by converting it in the future into a family microbusiness that provides her children employment and financial support.  \r\n<p>\r\nThis will be Patricia\u2019s 12th loan with MFP.  She says she likes working with her Communal Bank because all of the members make their payments on time, which helps the group get ahead.  Her loan of 1300 soles will be used to purchase textile materials needed to fulfill her latest orders.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":372522,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"Purchase textile materials","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-08-20T04:10:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":450,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Patricia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-08-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1300,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":192.49},{"due_date":"2009-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":201.45},{"due_date":"2009-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":212.21},{"due_date":"2009-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":221.75},{"due_date":"2010-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":231.01},{"due_date":"2010-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":241.09}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.63},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":69.73},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":73.46},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":76.76},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.97},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.45}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":66.63,"local_amount":192.49,"processed_date":"2009-09-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:35:18Z","rounded_local_amount":198.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87081189},{"amount":69.73,"local_amount":201.45,"processed_date":"2009-10-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:05:25Z","rounded_local_amount":207.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96997340},{"amount":73.46,"local_amount":212.21,"processed_date":"2009-11-11T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:54:24Z","rounded_local_amount":218.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103842684},{"amount":237.12,"local_amount":685,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T15:24:56Z","rounded_local_amount":705.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734266},{"amount":3.06,"local_amount":8.85,"processed_date":"2010-02-11T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:48:55Z","rounded_local_amount":9.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123959589}],"funded_date":"2009-08-20T14:13:19Z","paid_date":"2010-03-15T10:48:55Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ronan Reodica","image":498323}},{"id":134287,"name":"Juana","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Juana pertenece al Banco Comunal \u201cManuela de Hoy II\u201d  que esta ubicado en la Comunidad de Camicachi de el distrito de Ilave, Provincia de El Collao, Departamento de Puno, ella tiene 57 a\u00f1os de edad, estado civil soltera sin hijos y tiene estudios de primaria completa, vive en la comunidad de Choj\u00f1a Nati \n\nTrabaja con el movimiento Manuela Ramos hace casi 2 a\u00f1os,  con un pr\u00e9stamo inicial de S\/. 500.00 nuevos soles  para la compra de ganado menor. \n\nEn este momento ella requiere un pr\u00e9stamo de S\/. 3000.00 Nuevos soles, para la compra de vacunos que  luego de mejorarlos los vender\u00e1 en las ferias de la zona.\n\nSu deseo seguir trabajando.\n\nA ella le gustan los ahorros y los encuentros.\n","en":"Juana belongs to the \u201cManuela de Hoy II\u201d Community Bank, which is located in the community of Camicachi of the district of Ilave, El Collao Province, Department of Puno.

She contacted her local entrepreneurship and microfinance counselor, and discussed continuing her work with Fundacion Paraguaya. She gathered 15 women, all of whom work comfortably together today and support each other in solidarity with their shared goals.  \nThe group's members use their loans to invest in their individual activities, such as selling food, haberdashery, goods, herbs, garlic, cleaning products, mandioca (cassava), cushions, fruits, etc. \nA particularly inspirational woman in this committee is Do\u00f1a Felicita Pavon. Her story exemplifies the hard work that women in Paraguay put into their businesses and how female entrepreneurship makes a big difference in their lives and the lives of their families. Do\u00f1a Felicita Pavon sells groceries to help her husband with family expenses. She has three children, all of school-age. Her husband has temporary jobs, but no stable, fixed employment or salary. \nDo\u00f1a Felicita bakes small pies, makes sandwiches, patties and pastries to sell to her neighbors and workers who live and work in her community. Do\u00f1a Felicita finds it very difficult to sustain and grow a business when she has such a high turn over rate - which is why the loan she receives from the Fundacion is so helpful. She can continually invest more into her business and let it grow and increase her profits. She also finds the help she receives from the Fundacion in terms of training and preparation, very helpful. The challenges faced by a poor family are very unique and need special attention. \nAll committee members help each other to reach their common goals to better their livelihoods and achieve prosperity - the same goals as the Fundacion Paraguaya. \n"}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":430732,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Merchandise","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PY","country":"Paraguay","town":"Ita","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-25.483333 -57.35","type":"point"}},"partner_id":58,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1425,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Basilisa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Clara","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Pabla ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Benita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Rosa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Irma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nancy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sandra","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fermina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Felicita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Evergista","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Angela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elizabeth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gloria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lucia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-10-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PYG","disbursal_amount":6900000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":1425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":431250},{"due_date":"2009-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":431250},{"due_date":"2009-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":431250},{"due_date":"2009-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":431250},{"due_date":"2009-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":431250},{"due_date":"2009-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":431250},{"due_date":"2009-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":431250},{"due_date":"2009-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":431250},{"due_date":"2009-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":431250},{"due_date":"2010-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":431250},{"due_date":"2010-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":431250},{"due_date":"2010-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":431250},{"due_date":"2010-01-27T08:00:00Z","amount":431250},{"due_date":"2010-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":431250},{"due_date":"2010-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":431250},{"due_date":"2010-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":431250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":89.06},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":89.07},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":89.06},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":89.06},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":89.06},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":89.07},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":89.06},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":89.06},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":89.06},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":89.07},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":89.06},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":89.06},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":89.06},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.07},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.06},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.06}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":159051,"name":"Sandra Yaneth","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"la sra.

Given her social environment, she did not have the opportunity to further her education, and more than 20 years ago learned from a friend the rudiments of dying and selling clothes. \r\n\r\nAfter dying the Bazin cloth, she assembles several pieces to make men\u2019s shirts for sale. She is much in demand by her customers (for the most part travelers and truck drivers) for the quality of her products. Because her shop is well located at the Sikasso bus station, her business is flourishing and her customers are very satisfied.\r\n\r\nShe decided six years ago to join the Doro Yiriwaso MFI, to better satisfy an increasing number of customers with high expectations. After participating in a few group loans with a neighborhood women\u2019s loan group, she is now up to ten individual loans, all of which have been fully reimbursed.\r\n\r\nWith this loan she intends to buy: 15 pieces of white bazin fabric, 15 containers of dye in various colors, 15 packages of caustic soda, and a few pieces of \u2018pagne wax\u2019 cloth. She gets her supplies from Bamako, then resells them in her shop located in the center of the Sikasso bus station.\r\n\r\nShe expects this loan will help bring her monthly earnings up to 350,000 FCFA, which she will use to increase her stock of supplies, contribute to family expenses, repay her loan and invest the remainder in her business.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Ren\u00e9 McConnell, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":487573,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"Buy bazin fabric, pagnes cloth, caustic soda and dyes","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sikasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.316667 -5.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2010-02-13T21:00:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1050,"lender_count":31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Adiara ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-01-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":1050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2010-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2010-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2010-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2010-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2010-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2010-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2010-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":62500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131.25},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131.25},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131.25},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131.25},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131.25},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131.25},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131.25},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":131.25,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2010-02-21T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-18T08:48:58Z","rounded_local_amount":62964.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123991370},{"amount":131.25,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2010-03-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-19T10:52:06Z","rounded_local_amount":62964.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":129021646},{"amount":131.25,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2010-04-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T12:15:26Z","rounded_local_amount":62964.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136746435},{"amount":131.25,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2010-05-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T10:03:35Z","rounded_local_amount":62964.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144778972},{"amount":131.25,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:17:02Z","rounded_local_amount":62964.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151961182},{"amount":131.25,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T12:01:40Z","rounded_local_amount":62964.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159699347},{"amount":131.25,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:58:23Z","rounded_local_amount":62964.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166913280},{"amount":131.25,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:40:55Z","rounded_local_amount":62964.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172180476}],"funded_date":"2010-02-14T11:04:23Z","paid_date":"2010-10-15T10:40:55Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ren\u00e9 McConnell","image":467423}},{"id":179978,"name":"Anonymous","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This entrepreneur runs a grocery store.

She lives in the Baye Laye area, specifically in the Wakhinane neighborhood. She is a member of the institution U-IMCEC (bank of Baye Laye) since April 2008. She has already benefitted from two loans. She is a widow who is responsible for nine children  between the ages of 16 and 30 years old. Mrs D. is involved in the sale of breakfast foods in the morning. From time to time, she is also involved in the sale of female accessory items such as earrings and others. She has approximately 15 years of small business experience. Staying idle is not an option for her, which is the reason why she is interested in business which at least helps her address several economic problems.

Day to day they look for the way to get ahead with their families.  \r\n\r\nThey live in the parish with the same name as their communal bank.  It is located to the south of the Cuenca canton.  Cumbe has an area of 71.4 square kilometers and represents 2.3 percent of the territory of the canton.  It is 24 kilometers from the city of Cuenca, and it is connected by the asphalt road, Cuenca-Loja.\r\n\r\nAmong its activities, farming stands out.  Older people and women farm, and the rest of the population goes to Cuenca everyday to do different economic activities like working in factories, making handicrafts, or being employees in commerce.  Some provide services, primarily as construction workers. \r\n\r\nTeresa G. is 41 years old.  She lives in the Cumbe parish with her husband, a construction worker, and their six children.  The children\u2019s ages range from 20 to 3 years old.  Her first three children are in high school.  The other two are in elementary school in the area.  The youngest is with her all the time.  The house where they live is lent to them by a brother.  This is until they are able to have their own home, which will give the entire family tranquility.\r\n\r\nTeresa raises guinea pigs and chickens, and they grow rapidly.  They are for sale as much as for household consumption.  She has had two cycles.  With her new loan she will buy more chickens, guinea pigs, and food for them.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda Sarbelia C., age 51, is a very happy and charismatic member of the group.  This is her second loan.  She will buy baby chickens and food to enlarge her animal farm.  She has been doing this for a long time.  She also has a dairy cow, and she sells her production in her community.\r\n\r\nShe lives in the Cumbe parish with her husband and four of their five children.  The third daughter got married and lives independently.  Two of her children work and help economically with the household expenses.  They also help with the educational expenses of her last daughter, who goes to the local school.  Her second daughter does not work, but she helps with the household chores.\r\n\r\nHer goal is to have more animals in her farmyard.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva

R. was born in 1965. He is married and they are blessed with two children all below the age of 15 years old.  He lives in the Atouafona quarter of Akunlum Mankon, Bamenda North West Region of Cameroon.\t\t\r\n\r\nIn his early life, R. suffered the problem of inadequate schooling and the ability to afford good and quality education. He faces the challenges of providing the basic needs for his family, including the inability to meet up with the basic necessities of his family like clothing, feeding, transportation and educating himself and his children. He also faces difficulties in raising capital to start up a small business.\r\n\r\nWith this loan he is going to buy seedlings, pay rent on his piece of land and insecticides. He believes the business will succeed because the previous loan he took was repaid by the income raised from an old farm of his, so therefore he concludes that he is sure the business will succeed.\r\n\r\nHe is certain that this business will succeed because the products he produces are highly demanded in the market. The loan will help his community because they will be able to afford all food ingredients at low or no cost like tomatoes and green spices which adds flavor to soup.\r\n\r\nR. will plough back his profit into his business and use part to care for his family. He also will use the proceeds to pay his children\u2019s school fees and cater to the family. He prefers GHAPE because of the training he frequently receives and the low cost in obtaining and paying back a loan.\r\n\r\n<b>About GHAPE<\/b>\r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon.

She is 55 years old, and has been married to her husband for 38 years. She has 7 children, 6 of whom are now married and living independently.

Do\u00f1a Teresa owns the house, and she also has a  grocery store.\r\n\r\nThe loan she is seeking will be invested in her business in the best way possible: the first thing she wants to do is to buy a cornmeal milling machine, and then buy merchandise such as eggs, canned chiles, cookies, chips, and sweets - everything she needs that a grocery store should sell. She also wants to buy some chickens and turkeys to raise, and she needs the loan to do all of this.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult for Do\u00f1a Teresa when the electricity and water bills come in, because sometimes they can be so expensive that she doesn't know how she will pay. On occasions her daughter helps her out, but not always, and when she can't Do\u00f1a Teresa has to use money from the store, which she then can't re-invest. However, if she didn't pay it would be worse, because they would cut the electricity and then having it reconnected would be much more expensive. The same thing happens with the water. \r\n\r\nOne of Do\u00f1a Teresa's goals is to buy a young milk cow, and thus no longer have to buy milk. Milk is very expensive to buy and there is never enough for the three of them in the house. \r\n\r\nFor Do\u00f1a Teresa it is very important to save her earnings for her old age.

She tells us that she has regular customers who buy her beautiful garments.  She would like to improve her knitting and introduce new designs as she would like to open a store where everybody can buy her products.

The city is famous for its legendary Nazca Lines, a series of ancient, immense, and inexplicable hieroglyphs engraved in the desert that surrounds the city, generally attributed to the Nazca culture that inhabited the region between 300 and 899 AD. Thus, the city attracts a considerable quantity of tourists. But Nazca is also known for its hard-working people who have preserved their calm despite frequent earthquakes, tsunamis, and a high level of poverty in the region. Ruth lives with her companion and the two work hard in their enterprises.  Together they have 3 children whose ages are 12, 5, and 2 years. Their 12- and 5-year-olds already attend school. The eldest is in the 1st year of secondary school, and the younger is in the 1st year of primary school. The smallest one doesn't attend school as yet but, Ruth tells us he's very active. She loves the three very much and they motivate her every day to get ahead, despite any set backs that may occur.\r\n\r\nRuth is very determined and with much effort and dedication, she operates 2 businesses. The first is selling vegetables and groceries in the city market, and the second is selling drinks such as sodas and soft drinks in her mother's house. Ruth spends about 4 hours a day at her store in the market, and about  5 hours a day at the business in her mother's house. She works hard to get ahead and she believes she is doing well, due to her dedication and because she treats her customers in a kindly manner. She says she always treats others just as she wants them to treat her. In a day, she may earn up to 30 new sols and on a good day she can earn up to 60 new sols.\r\n\r\nRuth is very grateful to Kiva investors, since due to their offers of help, she can buy more groceries to sell, and thus, she will have more variety in her store, and more income. With this, she can continue saving towards her future grand dream: To have her own house for her family's

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":303371,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To purchase beans, wheat flour, and cooking oil for resale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mwanza","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.516667 32.9","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-04-14T18:30:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Penina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-04-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-27T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-05-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:14:42Z","rounded_local_amount":106160,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613685},{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-06-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:02:28Z","rounded_local_amount":106160,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010764},{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-07-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:39:15Z","rounded_local_amount":106160,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63233050},{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-08-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:53:29Z","rounded_local_amount":106160,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73664841},{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-09-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T02:46:39Z","rounded_local_amount":106160,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87105553}],"funded_date":"2009-04-15T19:09:46Z","paid_date":"2009-10-16T02:46:39Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"David Walker","image":null}},{"id":105595,"name":"Gideon","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Gideon D. is a pig grower.

His house has been adapted into a store where he has 12 computers, each in their own wooden cabinets and operates 3 mobile phone lines. With these he offers internet and phone services to local, national and international destinations. As in Villa Katanga and its surrounding areas there are few businesses that offer internet services, and it is very economical to make calls to mobiles, Luis Carlos' store is always very full of customers who come from several areas nearby. Most of the time they have to wait for the equipment to become free, so that they can access the services he offers. This is the reason why he is asking for his third loan, because he wants to buy computer equipment and systems and a couple of telephone lines. \r\nLuis Carlos  started out as an entrepreneur in 1997 when he used to sell records door to door and his business already had a name,  \u201cDiscos Carlos\u201d. It was then that he started his relationship with the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation with a $600,000 loan and he started up a record shop in his home. After a time he changed business, when selling records stopped being a good business. Therefore he suspended his loans and later when he started the business he currently has, three years ago, he began his credit relationship with this organization again.  And that was how he allocated a space in his home for his new business and since he received his loan his life has changed, because he was able purchase his home and buy fixed assets. His new dream is to consolidate his business and make it the preferred site for his customers. His biggest challenge is to buy a home to separate his commercial space from his family life. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Catherine Dent, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1025,"image":{"id":540004,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Computers","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"To buy computer equipment and systems and a couple of telephone lines.

He lives in his own house with his wife Nirce, 26, and his beloved daughter Joyita, who's 2-years-old. They are the principle motivation for all his hard work. The long days of work that Ugarte puts in at his small farm have made him realize that he has to work very hard to achieve a good quality crop. Every morning at dawn he walks approximately one hour to his fields where he grows coffee, bananas, cacao, and avocado. \r\n\r\nDuring the past 8 years of agricultural work he's realized that he greatly enjoys farming and does it with much care, but part of the job is being very careful to avoid plagues which attack and damage the crop.

She earns her living by operating two business ventures:  Food Vending and General Store businesses. Her husband, Wilfredo G., who is 50 years old, works as a driver to earn his living, and also helps in his wife's business activities.  They have three children who are 17 to 23 years old. \r\n\r\nAlestina joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2008 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past four loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Alestina has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 12,000 PHP helped her earn a monthly profit of approximately $150, raising the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 5th cycle loan, she is borrowing 14,000 PHP, which she intends to use to buy ingredients for her food vending and inventory for the store so that she can continue to save up for the future education of her children. Alestina G. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She has been a member of her community bank for 10 years and she likes being a member because of the help that the institution provides.\r\n\r\nLuz sells all kinds of clothes.  She makes her sales door to door and also sells from her home.  She works every day from 9.00am to 1.00pm and she also works all day at weekends.  She leaves her products with her customers on credit and collects payment every two weeks.  She buys her merchandise in Calceta and tells us that she chooses her customers carefully because it is very risky to leave products with people she doesn't know.  She tells us that she has been in her business for six years and it has done very well.\r\n\r\nLuz will use this loan to buy clothes; above all women's clothes, pants, blouses, t-shirts, and other garments.  Her dream is to own her own home since the house she lives in at the moment is rented."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":705606,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"To buy women's clothes, pants, t-shirts, blouses, etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Portoviejo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2011-02-03T15:01:42Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1100,"lender_count":39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Luz Moserrate","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-01-28T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1100,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2011-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2011-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2011-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2011-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2011-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2011-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2011-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2011-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":110}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":110,"local_amount":110,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:39:31Z","rounded_local_amount":110,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195841614},{"amount":220,"local_amount":220,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:01:50Z","rounded_local_amount":220,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201283995},{"amount":220,"local_amount":220,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:00:20Z","rounded_local_amount":220,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206151905},{"amount":330,"local_amount":330,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:12:37Z","rounded_local_amount":330,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211224741},{"amount":220,"local_amount":220,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:05:21Z","rounded_local_amount":220,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216503531}],"funded_date":"2011-02-16T01:29:14Z","paid_date":"2011-07-15T11:05:21Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Oxnard","image":null}},{"id":274435,"name":"Allen","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Allen  is 28 years, married to a soldier, and the mother of three children between the ages of 6 months and 6 years.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The Communal Bank is currently on its second cycle (each cycle lasting 4 months) and is comprised of nine hardworking people with a marked entrepreneurial spirit who tirelessly seek ways to move forward and give their children a better future. Most of the members live in the city, where they also have their livelihoods. Cusco is widely known as a city for tourism and trade, hosting the traditional Inti Raymi festivity and one of the seven wonders of the world, \u201cMachupicchu\u201d. \r\n\r\nOur featured member, Junia, was born in Pomacanchis District, in the Acomayo Province of the Departament of Cusco. She is 46 and has a 19-year-old son that attends a technical school. She works as a teacher for children with special needs as part of the ECEBE Program in Cusco City and also belongs to SAANEE's working group (SAANEE stands in Spanish for the Service for Bringing Diversity to Special Educational Needs).\r\n \r\nShe says she lived in Lima from age 5 to 27, where she studied in one of the most prestigious local universities but she now lives in Cusco. She has been working in her field for several years and has done well thanks to her dedication. She is asking for this loan for personal use, i.e., providing education to her son.  \r\n\r\nAll members appreciate the loan and are thankful for the opportunity given and promise to make their payments on time, according to schedule.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets.  Because of this, they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro-leasing is that is allows clients to use the leased equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":303390,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To purchase rice in bulk for her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Kyela","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-9.583333 33.85","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-04-14T21:20:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Fatuma H.","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-04-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-05-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:16:14Z","rounded_local_amount":88466.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613691},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:03:38Z","rounded_local_amount":88466.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010770},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-07-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:41:43Z","rounded_local_amount":88466.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63233056},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-08-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:56:08Z","rounded_local_amount":88466.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73664847},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T02:51:48Z","rounded_local_amount":88466.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87105559},{"amount":66.65,"local_amount":83333.35,"processed_date":"2009-10-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T06:33:56Z","rounded_local_amount":88466.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97022681}],"funded_date":"2009-04-14T23:53:34Z","paid_date":"2009-11-16T06:33:56Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Thomas Harris","image":null}},{"id":105611,"name":"Paulina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"51-year-old Paulina E. is from Jimenez,Misamis Occidental, Philippines.

Mimi has been engaged in her business for 1 year and earns approximately Php2,400.00 a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn June 2009, Mimi joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Mimi is requesting a loan of 3,000 PHP, which she will invest in expanding her business. This will be the first loan taken out by Mimi from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

This district is noted for having the majority of its population concentrated in a central town and in various rural communities that are very far from each other.  The district belongs to the Lambayeque province.  It is 45 minutes from the city of Chiclayo.\r\n\r\nSara has studied for a career as a technical nurse.  She currently relies on her studies to get income.  She has been working in health centers in rural areas of her district for ten years.  This work provides a stable income, which helps her husband support the household.\r\n\r\nAlso, she has been selling poultry for six years.  She buys birds from the people who live in the rural area of M\u00f3rrope.  She fattens them and sells them in the city of Chiclayo.  Occasionally she also buys fish and sells it in her house to her neighbors.\r\n\r\nSara tells us that these activities have been useful to her in order to get ahead.  Now her family has their own home.  Also, she feels that the work she does in the rural areas helps the villagers to have a better quality of life.\r\n\r\nShe wants to work a little more to be able to get a greater income because her youngest child will be registering for school very soon.  That is why she has asked, for the first time, Edpyme Alternative for a loan of 800 PEN.  She will use it to buy poultry to expand her business of selling poultry.\r\n\r\nSara is a happy woman, and she always works thinking of her family\u2019s well-being.   Her greatest desire is to improve the infrastructure of her house because it is still maD. of adobe.  In the area where she lives she is loved and respected by her neighbors. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":547776,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Buy poultry to expand her business of raising them and selling them","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"M\u00f3rrope - Lambayeque","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":143,"posted_date":"2010-05-28T23:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":300,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sara","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-04-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":800,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","amount":68.55},{"due_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":71.63},{"due_date":"2010-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":73.95},{"due_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","amount":75.06},{"due_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":78.75},{"due_date":"2010-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":79.89},{"due_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":84.73},{"due_date":"2010-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":86.61},{"due_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","amount":89.01},{"due_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":91.82}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.71},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.86},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.73},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.15},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.53},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.96},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.77},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.48},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.38},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.43}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":25.71,"local_amount":68.55,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:07:15Z","rounded_local_amount":73.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144695238},{"amount":26.86,"local_amount":71.63,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:38:22Z","rounded_local_amount":77.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151878298},{"amount":27.73,"local_amount":73.95,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T10:50:43Z","rounded_local_amount":79.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159618329},{"amount":28.15,"local_amount":75.06,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:02:22Z","rounded_local_amount":80.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166832725},{"amount":29.53,"local_amount":78.75,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T09:56:58Z","rounded_local_amount":84.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172099331},{"amount":29.96,"local_amount":79.89,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-16T10:42:57Z","rounded_local_amount":86.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177555296},{"amount":64.25,"local_amount":171.34,"processed_date":"2010-12-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T12:53:24Z","rounded_local_amount":184.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188666287},{"amount":33.38,"local_amount":89.01,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T02:56:13Z","rounded_local_amount":95.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191409615},{"amount":34.43,"local_amount":91.82,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T08:31:56Z","rounded_local_amount":98.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":196108059}],"funded_date":"2010-05-29T00:44:42Z","paid_date":"2011-03-24T08:31:56Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ginny Kalish"}},{"id":208889,"name":"Maame Ama","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Maame Ama N. is a hairdresser by profession at Abura.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from selling personal use products such as shampoo, soap & body lotions in the local community. Carolina has been engaged in her business for over three years and earns approximately 3500 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Carolina joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Carolina has successfully repaid a previous loan from ASKI. Carolina is requesting a new loan of 8000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This will be the 2nd loan taken out by Carolina from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 38 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":732249,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Products

From the estimation of 28-year-old Esther, it carries a whole lot of meaning and brings dividends that one would not enjoy while in formal employment.\r\n\r\nEsther, a happy-go-lucky mother of two set forth in her pub business a year ago. She operates from Kayunga, a stone's throw away from Kampala. She had gotten disillusioned with the red tape manifest in formal employment.\r\n\r\nEsther says from the day she started working, the thought of being her own boss always crossed her mind. She invariably wanted to have the leverage to make her own decisions. What has helped Esther in periods of uncertainty has been her ability to look on the bright side of things. A pub is a profitable venture so if one is painstaking in his or her plans and adds a sense of shrewdness, they are bound to reap big.\r\n\r\nEsther sells both hard and soft beverages at her pub. Monthly, her sales profits add up to Ugandan shillings 350,000. Esther\u2019s group is on their 5th loan with Pearl Micro-finance. Esther also ekes out a side income from farming. She says she will use her loan to purchase more crates of soft and hard drinks to resell.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3850,"image":{"id":870702,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pub","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to

In search of a financial support for his children, Turatbek started his animal husbandry (fattening up and reselling livestock) business.  Having started with an initial sum of 10,000 som (KGS), Turatbek was able to develop his business, which now has 4 cows, 20 sheep and 1 horse and a monthly profit of 12,500 som (KGS).  Turatbek sells fattened-up livestock at a livestock market.  His property also includes land, where he sows cereal crops and sainfoin.  He sells the harvest to his regular wholesale buyers.  In order to further increase his livestock headcount, Turatbek requested a loan in the sum of 100,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company to buy additional livestock for fattening up.  He plans to use the expected profit to stock up on fodder and hay for the winter in order to sell fattened up livestock at good prices in the spring.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2200,"image":{"id":914441,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase additional livestock","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Issyk-Kol village","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2011-11-11T19:30:24Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2200,"lender_count":64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Turatbek","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-11-04T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":100000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":19,"loan_amount":2200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2012-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2012-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2013-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":55000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":220},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":440},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":330},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1210}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":220,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T08:39:40Z","rounded_local_amount":10075.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":269975570},{"amount":1980,"local_amount":90000,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T09:13:08Z","rounded_local_amount":90678.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308095357}],"funded_date":"2011-12-20T17:14:10Z","paid_date":"2012-10-15T09:13:08Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Anna Sorokina","image":null}},{"id":360544,"name":"Nabeki Shg Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Alice is the facilitator of the Nabeki SHG group.

This urban parish is located only ten minutes from the city of Portoviejo, the capital of Manab\u00ed, which has an abundance of history.  The members of the communal bank Mar\u00eda Asunci\u00f3n meet here bimonthly.  \r\n\r\nThis is where Carlina lives.  She is 35 years old, married and has two children ages 12 and 8 with her husband.  Both of her children attend school.  Her husband is a merchant and a bricklayer.  \r\n\r\nShe is a homemaker.  When she realized that her husband's income would not cover the family expenses she started selling all types of clothing.  She sells door to door.  She works mostly in the mornings since her children come home in the afternoon and she has to help them with their homework and take care of them.

Now that she is the mother of five, she doesn't want her children to experience the life that she had. She is 43 years old and married to Lydio, a carpenter. She lives in Morong, Rizal province, in the Philippines.\r\n\r\nWith her innate desire to remove her family from poverty, in 2004 Arlene joined ASHI (Ahon sa Hirap, Inc.), an MFI and Kiva partner in the Philippines. She was very careful and wise in spending her loans and invested them in her resale business. Her business brings her income that can sustain the needs of her family, specially of her children.\r\n\r\nJust recently, Arlene requested a loan of 20,000 pesos as additional rolling capital for her resale business. Specifically, the loan will be used to pay for fifty kilos of peanuts, rice, charcoal, bananas and vegetables, all for resale. She hopes that her business will grow and will bring her enough profit for her to achieve her dreams: to educate her children and also to build her own house.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":361558,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery

He is a very hardworking and responsible father. He lives in his own home with his wife Estela, who is 46. She helps him with his crops. He also lives with his 3 children: Elizabeth, 23, Luis, 20, and Rosa, 17. What he wants more than anything is to have a calm old age and for this he needs to give his children an good education. \r\n\r\nFor Esteban, farming has been an activity he needs to live. Since he was very small, his parents taught him that if he worked in the fields he wouldn't lack for food. That is why he decided to continue with the family work and now he has his own crops. He has planted potatoes, peas, carrots, etc. Once these are harvested, he takes them to market in the city of Tarma.  \r\n\r\nWhat he likes the most about his work is planting, since he knows that his family's stability depends on this activity. He has been in farming for 50 years. What he considers the hardest is taking care of his crops in sudden weather changes, since this affects his productivity a lot. \r\n\r\nThis is the eight loan that Esteban has had with MFP and he knows that the loan will be beneficial to the development of his activity. In his communal bank, he is a very responsible member, and because of this he is very respected. \r\n\r\nWith the eight hundred nuevos soles he is asking for, he will purchase pea seed, fertilizer and insecticide to have a good harvest. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ellen Donohue, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":495631,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Puchase of seed and fertilizer","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-02-25T11:40:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":275,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Esteban","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-02-08T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":800,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":800}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":275}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":275,"local_amount":800,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:39:45Z","rounded_local_amount":808.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166886796}],"funded_date":"2010-02-25T14:01:59Z","paid_date":"2010-09-15T10:39:45Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ellen Donohue","image":541577}},{"id":184325,"name":"Anonymous","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":""}},"status":"defaulted","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":726677,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty Salon","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"To purchase more salon items in bulk.","delinquent":true,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-6 35","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2010-03-12T18:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":600,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Anonymous","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":800000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":133333.33},{"due_date":"2010-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":133333.33},{"due_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":133333.33},{"due_date":"2010-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":133333.33},{"due_date":"2010-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":133333.33},{"due_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":133333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":100,"local_amount":133333.33,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-10T13:03:59Z","rounded_local_amount":135134.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136741015},{"amount":100,"local_amount":133333.33,"processed_date":"2010-05-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-10T13:05:44Z","rounded_local_amount":135134.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144774129}],"funded_date":"2010-03-16T04:05:44Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Brett & Margaret Silberg","image":null}},{"id":188421,"name":"Juna","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Juna N. lives in Dolchoki Village.

The group is comprised of 10 members and it is the first time that they have requested a loan from credicomun.  Mrs. \u00c1ngela Z\u00fa\u00f1iga Hern\u00e1ndez is a member of this group; she is 31 years old and studied until the 6th grade.  She is married and has two sons- ages 8 and 7.  She breeds and fattens sheep, which began 8 years ago with a single lamb, which fattened and sold.  With this money, she bought a lamb for the reproduction of the species and that\u2019s how their business began.  She is requesting the loan to buy food and fodder to feed their sheep. When she sells them, she will be able to acquire others and again invest in the growth of the lamb from the sheep.  Also, she has other animals such as chickens, turkeys, and rabbits.\r\n\r\nShe is excited about her loan application, because she has had other loans, which have benefited her greatly.  She has been able to invest in growing food for her animals and to consume in her home. She has also been able to invest in school supplies and clothing for her children. She is convinced that while business thrives she will continue working to provide greater opportunity for her childrens\u2019 education. She will also be able to improve their quality of life by bringing in goods for the home and services such as water and electricity since she does not currently have them.  Also, she hopes in time to increase the size of her rabbit-raising business because she believes that this business also generates good profits and maybe later can get larger orders, butchered or alive. Then, the business will grow generating the best income possible for her and her family. Areli C. D\u00edaz is the president of the group.  She is 22 years old and studied until her third year of high school.  She is a housewife with no children. She started fattening pigs a year ago and is requesting a loan to buy the food and fodder for these animals. \r\n\r\nThe other members of the group include:\r\n-Paulina T. D.

She earns her living by operating two business ventures:  perfumes\/cosmetics sales and fish vending.  Her husband Roland, who is 46 years old, works as a government employee to earn his living and helps in his wife's business activities.  They have three children who are 12 to 24 years old. Elisa joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1997 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 20 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Elisa has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 29,500 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 15,000, thus uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 21st loan, she is borrowing PHP 29,500, which she intends to use to buy perfumes\/cosmetics to sell to continue to save up for future house renovations.  Elisa is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

mayor\u00eda de su poblaci\u00f3n se encuentra agrupada en zonas urbano \u2013 marginales, es aleda\u00f1o a la ciudad de Chiclayo.\n\nSe dedica desde hace muchos a\u00f1os a la venta de comida en su

frecuentan el lugar. Este negocio le provee de ingresos necesarios para ayudar en el mantenimiento de su hogar, ya que los ingresos que percibe su esposo como trabajador de un peque\u00f1o hotel no bastan para salir adelante.\n\nHace dos a\u00f1os Patricia y su esposo adquirieron una mototaxi (veh\u00edculo motorizado utilizado en el transporte de carga y pasajeros) con unos ahorros que hab\u00edan estado reuniendo, con este veh\u00edculo se vienen generando algunos ingresos adicionales, el veh\u00edculo es manejado por un chofer particular y brinda servicios dentro del distrito de Jos\u00e9 Leonardo Ortiz y la ciudad de Chiclayo.\n\nEl continuo uso brindado a la unidad movil ha hecho que esta empiece a sufrir algunas fallas que requieren de urgente reparaci\u00f3n para que pueda funcionar correctamente. Por ello Patricia se encuentra solicitando a Edpyme Alternativa un cr\u00e9dito de 2000 nuevos soles que piensa utilizar en la reparaci\u00f3n y mantenimiento de su veh\u00edculo as\u00ed como en la renovaci\u00f3n de las licencias necesarias que permitan brindar su servicio dentro de la legalidad correspondiente.\n\nPatricia es una mujer emprendedora y una madre muy entregada a su familia.

It is considered the most populated district in the region and it also has one of the highest indices of poverty.  The majority of the population is in urban areas and is marginalized; she lives next to the city of Chiclayo.\r\n<p>Patricia has sold food in her home for many years, she has a menu and cebiche (typical dish made from fresh fish) sold to mechanics that work in the area and to the mototaxistas who frequent the place.  This business gives her the necessary income to help the household since the income that her husband receives as a worker in a small hotel is not enough to get ahead.\r\n<p>Two years ago, Patricia and her husband got a mototaxi (a motorized vehicle used to transport cargo and passengers) with some savings that they collected.  They have gotten some extra income from this vehicle.  It is driven by a hired driver and the mototaxi runs in the Jos\u00e9 Leonardo Ortiz district and in the city of Chiclayo.\r\n<p>The continual use of the vehicle has meant that it has had some problems and it is important to repair it so that it can work properly.  Patricia is asking for a loan of 2000 nuevos soles from Edpyme Alternativa (Kiva\u2019s field partner) that she will use to repair and maintain and to renew the necessary licenses to operate the mototaxi legally.\r\n<p>Patricia is a very enterprising woman and a very dedicated mother.  Her biggest with is to give her daughter a better quality of life.  She has worked with our institution before and has shown to be punctual and responsible when making her payments.  In the picture she is shown with her mototaxi and the driver in charge of driving it.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Mayra Duque, Kiva

She buys goods from her suppliers every 45 days and has a good stock of merchandise.  However, her working capital is mainly tied up in her long-term portfolio and she needs to finance her business.  This is why she is requesting a Kiva loan, which will be the first loan that she has received from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  She will use it to buy plastic tables and chairs, small electrical appliances, etc.\r\n\r\nAracely's liquidity ratio is high and she maintains a profitability margin which is in keeping with this type of business.  Her new injection of working capital will be successful because she has a good position in the market.  In addition, Aracely and her husband have the experience they need to achieve their goal.\r\n\r\nAracely's dream is to own her own home and, through her efforts, to ensure a prosperous future for her children by supporting them in their education."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":791832,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home

She learned her trade from her mother who is also in the same line of business.  Before learning her trade, Mar\u00eda was a student, but then decided to sell tamales.  She lives with her husband and children in a house owned by her mother.\r\n\r\nThe corn she uses for the tamales is delivered to her home but it is more expensive because of the delivery.

The loan he is currently requesting would be his second.  He intends to repay it in full and on time as he considers himself a responsible and honest young man, who fulfills the agreements he makes.

She needs a job to get more experience working. Soon she will take a leave of absence, but will remain on the pay-roll. Also, in the afternoon Shukufa helps her mother-in-law sell various goods in a small shop close to her home. They sell such food items as bread, sugar, pasta, etc. and other things including socks, hats, scarves, and all sorts of knick-knacks. Her mother-in-law goes to the town market for the food-stuffs, and has to go to a different town to get the non-edible things. Shukufa is taking out a loan for the first time, but she really wants to make a large profit before the New Year. If everything goes well, she will continue to take out loans in the future.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Russian by Anya Ezhevskaya, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":244946,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"for business expansion","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Khujand","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"40.28 69.631667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":47,"posted_date":"2008-12-27T17:20:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Shukufa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-12-26T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":1200,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2009-02-26T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2009-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2009-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2009-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2009-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":200}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2009-01-26T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-19T09:06:34Z","rounded_local_amount":213.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":10229622},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2009-02-26T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T20:19:13Z","rounded_local_amount":213.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20427135},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2009-03-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:55:55Z","rounded_local_amount":213.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27120643},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2009-04-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T22:09:22Z","rounded_local_amount":213.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36015761},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2009-05-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T01:16:54Z","rounded_local_amount":213.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44599498},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2009-06-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-30T07:41:49Z","rounded_local_amount":213.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52993941}],"funded_date":"2008-12-27T17:49:57Z","paid_date":"2009-07-30T07:41:49Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":85179,"name":"Bashiran Sabir Ali Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Bashiran baji is a 52 years old married lady and has resided in a city named Arifwala, Pakistan, for the past 12 years.

He is a hard-working man who earns income operating a motorbike taxi (called a piki piki by the locals) in Kisumu, Kenya.  However, he currently has to lease a motorcycle which costs a lot, leaving little profit.  Even if he does not get much business on a given day, Christopher has to pay the fee to the motorbike owner.  He therefore dreams of being able to save enough to afford his own motorbike, so that he can keep all the money he makes from his business.  Christopher already has decided on a particular model available at a downtown retail store, and will use his loan to make a down-payment.  \r\nChristopher is extremely excited about the work that
