After almost 16 years of working in shoe repair, he started making shoes once he was able to buy the necessary tools and materials. He learned this trade, which has been his work and means of supporting his family, in the city of Camuapa. He and his wife strive to educate and provide for their children. She makes homemade tortillas to cover their basic expenses like water and electricity, among others.<br>\r\nLately sales have been low so he plans to use the loan to buy a variety of leathers to make different styles of shoe to sell this Christmas. His plans are to buy his own house since he still lives in a room in his mother\u2019s home; it has been difficult for him but he has not had the means to build one. He does not have the privacy he would like and wants to provide a better life for his children. He is very happy for the loan, which has allowed him to invest in his business.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Carolyn McCaffrey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":441732,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Manufacturing","sector":"Manufacturing","themes":null,"use":"Buy a variety of leather to make different styles of shoe","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Managua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.150833 -86.268333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":98,"posted_date":"2009-12-06T16:20:14Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":450,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Francisco Jose","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":9000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2010-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2010-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2010-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2010-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2010-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2010-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2010-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2010-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":52.34,"local_amount":1046.85,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T09:52:29Z","rounded_local_amount":1086.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118003320},{"amount":50.46,"local_amount":1009.23,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T07:52:49Z","rounded_local_amount":1047.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123841482},{"amount":50.35,"local_amount":1007.05,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T07:50:28Z","rounded_local_amount":1045.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128874402},{"amount":49.94,"local_amount":998.73,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T09:30:33Z","rounded_local_amount":1036.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136604283},{"amount":50.75,"local_amount":1015.05,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T08:31:22Z","rounded_local_amount":1053.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144639746},{"amount":50.33,"local_amount":1006.6,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:00:59Z","rounded_local_amount":1044.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151821531},{"amount":145.83,"local_amount":2916.49,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T09:03:29Z","rounded_local_amount":3027.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159561537}],"funded_date":"2009-12-09T12:39:39Z","paid_date":"2010-08-15T09:03:29Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":163664,"name":"Luis","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Luis A.

It is a small group, but a very united one, and the members have known each other for several years.  They decided to call themselves Kikas because, in their town, it is how Jazm\u00edn\u2019s daughters are known.  She is the group\u2019s representative, and there are six members in the group:  \r\n\r\n1.- Jazm\u00edn A. G., 29 years old\u2028\r\n2.- Gelacio G. S., 35 years old\r\n\u20283.-Ambrocio G. S., 38 years old\r\n\u20284.-Ana Luisa M. N., 35 years old\u2028\r\n5.-Marcelina T. C., 29 years old\u2028\r\n6.-Cecilia Garc\u00eda T., 21 years old\r\n\r\nThe 6 people mentioned are neighbors and friends in the community.  They formed the group because each person had good references from another member.  The community where they live is very humble and a place where, in general, people earn a living farming or raising animals such as:  cows, chickens and sheep.  These are the activities the people know and can relate to.  Most women are homemakers, and the women in this group are no exception.  However, they are women that want to get ahead and support their husbands with the household and children expenses.  This is also the case with Jazm\u00edn.\r\n\r\nJazm\u00edn appears on the right side of the photograph, wearing a red sweatshirt with the number 53.  She is a very hard-working woman, married for 10 years, who lives with her husband and 4 children:\r\n\r\nThe oldest is an 11-year old daughter who is in primary school.  She tells us she is very smart, and a young girl who applies herself.  After her, is a 9-year old daughter who is also in primary school and attends the same school as her older sister.  She tells us she has difficulty with math.  After this daughter comes a son who is only 2, and another daughter, who is 1.\r\n\r\nJazm\u00edn owns her house, a fact that gives her some peace because she doesn\u2019t have to pay rent, which would be one more household expense.  Her husband works as a mechanic\u2019s assistant, but she tells us he doesn\u2019t earn much.  He hasn\u2019t left this work because it would be difficult for him to find a job earning more money since he didn\u2019t finish secondary school.  These days, employers are requiring at least having completed preparatory school.  Jazm\u00edn\u2019s family lives in a difficult situation, but she wants to put forth great effort and not see herself defeated.  She wants to forge ahead for her daughters.  For this reason, she started with a small business, which, all the same, generates income.  Jazm\u00edn sells \u201cjarceria\u201d, which is the business of selling plastic goods.  Jarceria is everything that has to do with plastics.  For example, trash bins, water tanks, buckets, spoons, chairs, tables, etc.  What Jazm\u00edn does is buy these products by the dozen, and returns to her community to sell them door-to-door.  This is a tough job, because she has to carry her products, along with her 1-year old baby, and no ordinary woman would be motivated to do this.\r\n\r\nHowever, this is Jazm\u00edn\u2019s daily bread, and she doesn\u2019t get discouraged; rather, to the contrary, she wants to get ahead and thinks only of her children and of providing them with a brighter future.  \r\n\r\nJazm\u00edn, along with her group, are trustworthy members, neighbors, and hard-working people who, like Jazm\u00edn, seek to get ahead and support their households.  This is why they\u2019ve requested a loan.  Jazm\u00edn is thinking about investing her loan into buying merchandise by the dozen, because it is cheaper to buy by the dozen or in sets.  From the moment she buys in bulk, she is making a profit via this means.\r\n\r\nThe other members of Kikas devote themselves to the following:  Mr. Gelacio and Mr. Ambrocio raise livestock, and these two have requested the loan to buy cows who might yield calves in the future.

She has been farming for 22 years in her home area of Muranga in Central Kenya producing bananas and French beans.  She employs three farmhands.  She also runs a retail shop for additional income. \r\n\r\nNaomi is requesting for a loan for 50,000 KES from Kiva partner Juhudi Kilimo to help her in purchasing farm inputs, specifically a water pump and banana inputs in order to expand  her banana plantation. She says that the inputs will increase her French beans production since she will be able to manage the water shortage. Naomi concurs with other farmers that drought and general water shortage remain their greatest farming challenge. She adds that Juhudi loan will help alleviate

A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

Amal has a good experience in this field beside getting help from her husband which makes her project successful. \r\n\r\nAmal wants to expand her project and purchase more chicks and more feed for them, but the amount of money she has isn't enough to pay, so she needs to take a loan from FATEN. When Amal gets the loan which is repaid on a monthly basis, she will be able to expand her project and purchase more chicks and feed. That will improve her project and she will be able to compete with others in the same field and increase her sales and so increase her income. \r\n\r\nAmal is a conservative woman, so her husband Nayef is photographed instead of her in the poultry project.\r\n\r\n About this loan product:\r\n\r\n FATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan. For more information on lending in the Muslim world, please visit Kiva's Muslim World Lending helptext: http:\/\/tinyurl.com\/3aekx8m.\r\n

Makhfirat is a hard-working woman. She is married with three children, two of whom are married and have their own family. For the past 10 years, Makhfirat has dedicated herself to selling office supplies. She started her business after her husband's contract with the construction company he was employed with terminated. She then decided to generate her own income to try to fill the gap. She enjoys her business and has developed a stable enterprise. Makhfirat has requested a loan of $ 800 USD to purchase new supply of items to sell. She commits to paying her loan back within 12 months. This loan is important for her family's well-being as it will help Makhfirat\u2019s business grow. She truly appreciates your generosity. \r\n\r\nTajikistan\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history and diverse culture, which is a mix of the Islamic faith, Soviet influence, and Central Asian traditions. It served as a key post along the Silk Road and marked the end of Alexander the Great's extensive rule. It was the birthplace of the great Persian poet Rudaki and famous Islamic philosopher Ibn Sina. And it is home to epic mountain passes, communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. \r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Abdukosim has been baking traditional bread since childhood. He inherited this skill from his father and grandfather. His working day starts at 4 a.m. when he and his assistants begin to knead dough, form the bread, and heat the stove. For the first time, Abdukosim kneads dough from 2 sacks of flour of 50 kg. each. The summer is an important period for his business, as citizens have many weddings and other family events. He needs to have a stock of flour and coal. For this reason Abdukosim applied to IMON International for a loan of 9000 Somoni. Abdukosim and his family appreciate your support in helping him improve his business.  \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

This is Realiza G., 38, resident of Caloocan City, Philippines. She is married to Romeo G., a carpenter, and mother of two children, one of whom are already in elementary while the youngest, just barely able to toddle around, is the apple of Realiza and Romeo\u2019s eyes. By the grace of God, Realiza has managed to support her older child's schooling. At this time, she is working hard to be able to send both of her children all the way through college. This is a dream for most Filipino parents like Realiza, as she herself has been a college undergraduate and believes that a college diploma is the best inheritance parents could leave to their children.\r\n\r\nRealiza operates a meat shop. Live pigs are bought from hog raisers and then slaughtered and sold to the immediate community. She has many patrons who buy the cut meat and then sell it at their respective market stalls. There are many patrons who prefer Realiza\u2019s products since they are assured of its freshness and cleanliness. It is also a little cheaper to buy meat from an independent meat shop than the ones in the marker who sometimes use the services of professional slaughter houses for their meat. The cost of slaughter is added to the final price of the cut meat, and passed along to the customers. Thus, Realiza has many patrons who regularly anticipate her meat. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of Php300 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php 16,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy live pigs to be slaughtered and sold every day. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.\r\n  \r\nRealiza dreams of being able to give both her children a good and high quality education through all her hard work in her business. She also hopes to have her own market stall someday. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay Micro Finance loans.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":589429,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Butcher

She is a widow with one daughter in her care: Sonia Saraos H., age 19, and a grandson who has lived with her since he was little, Alde\u00edn, age 9. \r\n\r\nShe is requesting the loan to buy merchandise and stock her clothing business with items such as pants, shirts, t-shirts, children's suits, blouses, and dresses, among others. She sells these items in the communities near her village. She has done this work for nin years, and it is going well for her, since she has been able to obtain a good income for her household. \r\n\r\nWhat motivated her to start this activity was her family, since she is a woman alone and had to find a way to obtain an income and help her family get ahead. \r\n\r\nWith the earnings she obtains from her business, she will buy more merchandise of better quality, so that her customers will be motivated to buy more. With this, she will be able to earn better profits and expand her business. \r\n\r\nThe dream that Fe de Luz has is to be able to save up enough to build a store where she can display her merchandise, so the people from nearby settlements can buy her clothing while she goes out to sell her merchandise in other communities. Thus, she would obtain income from both sides of her business. However, the most important thing for her is that her daughter continues her studies and finishes her degree so she can become a doctor. \r\n\r\nShe formed the group with two other women who have already worked with a loan, and they comment that it is going well for them. The group is called \"El Crucero\" [The Crossing], and the reason for the name is that one of the members has cross the highway which divides the area from other towns, so they decided to choose this name. \r\n\r\nThe group is made up of three women, each with a different activity: \r\n\r\nOfelia G\u00f3mez Jim\u00e9nez will invest the loan in buying Tupperware plastic items, such as plastic boxes, pitchers and cups, among others. \r\nFe de Luz H.

Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Marietha is a thirty-five-year-old married mother from Dar es Salaam. She has four children between the ages of eight and eighteen. Marietha runs a small store from which she sells essential grocery items in Dar es Salaam. <P>The Swahili word for this type of outside shop, or stall, is genge. A genge is usually a very basic structure made of wood, with a tin roof, which sells general items such as onions, tomatoes, chilli, oil, rice, and dried fish. It is the kind of place local people send their children running to fetch something when they are in the middle of cooking the evening meal, and don\u2019t have time to go all the way to the market to buy the missing ingredient. <P>Marietha started her stall in 2006 and she has been earning monthly profits of US$ 100 from it since. She is requesting a loan of US$ 275 in order to purchase additional stocks of vegetables in bulk. She intends to retail these for a profit and hopefully increase the quantity and range of her products in the future.\r\n\r\n<P>SELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility as a practical way to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women. <P>Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions as they lack tangible collateral assets. This leads to poor financial support hence the poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.<P> When a client needs working capital to buy a specific item, SELFINA buys the equipment for said client and extends a loan to her. The same equipment is then leased back to the client so they can use it while in process of paying back their loan \u2013 a process called a sale and leaseback arrangement. Once the loan has been repaid, SELFINA transfers the ownership of the equipment to the client.<P> The advantage of microleasing over traditional microfinance loans is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":191778,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To purchase additional stocks of vegetables in bulk","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Dar es Salaam","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-6.8 39.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-08-29T19:10:22Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":275,"lender_count":6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marietha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-09-12T19:43:11Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":300000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2008-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2008-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2009-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2009-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2009-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2009-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2009-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2009-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2009-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":30000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":28,"local_amount":30545.45,"processed_date":"2008-10-11T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-20T07:18:45Z","rounded_local_amount":32564,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356189},{"amount":27,"local_amount":29454.55,"processed_date":"2008-11-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T04:18:28Z","rounded_local_amount":31401,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5347931},{"amount":27.5,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2008-12-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:08:52Z","rounded_local_amount":31982.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9970505},{"amount":27.5,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2009-01-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:13:19Z","rounded_local_amount":31982.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14886722},{"amount":27.5,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2009-02-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:02:23Z","rounded_local_amount":31982.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20435982},{"amount":27.5,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2009-03-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:54:51Z","rounded_local_amount":31982.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130280},{"amount":27.49,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2009-04-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:23:06Z","rounded_local_amount":31982.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027111},{"amount":27.5,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2009-05-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:12:46Z","rounded_local_amount":31982.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613151},{"amount":27.5,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2009-06-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:00:58Z","rounded_local_amount":31982.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010234},{"amount":27.51,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2009-07-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:37:46Z","rounded_local_amount":31982.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63232545}],"funded_date":"2008-08-29T19:43:11Z","paid_date":"2009-08-15T18:37:46Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":65106,"name":"H\u00e9ctor","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Hector M.

She is a very hard working Mom. She lives in her own house together with her husband, their 3 children and her father. She sells casual clothing to her friends and family and on the weekends she sells tamales (a popular dish in Lima). In the very early in the morning she goes shopping and then she washes the corn husks that will hold the tamales. She enjoys her work, especially because her business is very well patronized by her clients. Raquel works alongside her family. While she makes the sauce her husband mills the corn. In the future she hopes to install a gate at her door, to make her house and business safe. She is committed to the obligations of this loan, as she always has. She knows that these loans key to the progress of her business. With this loan she will purchase new kitchen tools so that she may continue making tamales. She would also like to have more table cloths to dress up her business. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Erika Lindig, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":900,"image":{"id":582025,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To purchase kitchen utensils.

Cogon, Lapu-Lapu City, Cebu. She earns her living by operating a business venture: a vegetable vending  business.  Her husband Wensislao D., who is 47 years old, helps his wife in running the business. They have 5 children who are 7 to 23 years old. \r\n\r\nLuciana joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2009 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 2 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Luciana has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 6,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 20,000, thus  uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 3rd cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 11,000 which she intends to use as additional capital for her business so that she can continue to save up for the future and expand her business.  Luciana D. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

By the grace of God, Lorna has managed to support her child's schooling. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their every day expenses.\r\n\r\nLorna operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a Php5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at a wholesale price and selling at piece rate.  Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of Php200 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php14,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy more quantities of products like groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nLorna hopes that business will improve and pick up soon. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners.

He is 52 years old. Nestor is widowed and has four school-aged children. To make a living, he owns and operates a business venture in the services sector, providing tri-sikad or mechanical tricycle services to local community members. He is also planting and harvesting rubber trees seasonally. Nestor has been engaged in his business for over twenty-six years and earns approximately $280 a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Nestor joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and ability to engage in business activities. He has successfully repaid a previous loan of 11,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to purchase materials needed to provide his service. \r\n\r\nHe is requesting a new loan of 14,000 PHP which will be used to purchase tools needed for the maintenance of the service. This will be his 4th loan from HSPFI. He plans to use the additional revenue generated to improve his business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

His parents owned some agricultural machinery (tractor T-40, trailer, plow, cultivator) and five hectares of agricultural land (two hectares of orchard and three hectares of arable land). They acquired the machinery and land as a result of privatization after the dissolution of the collective farm (kolkhoz). \r\n\r\nDinu has leased another six hectares of orchards and seven hectares of arable land, so he cultivates 18 hectares of land in total. In 2012, Dinu purchased on credit a tractor (MTZ-82), which cost 300 000 MDL, and a second-hand water tank at a cost of 30 000 MDL. \r\n\r\nDinu also needs a disc harrow, which he has been leasing from other farmers, making it difficult to carry out the work on time. He is praying for help from Kiva lenders. The disc harrow costs 80,000 MDL which is equivalent to US$5,600. Dinu has requested a loan of US$3,000, to add to US$2,600 of his own.

This business has allowed her to finance the education of all of her children and to handle the needs of her family. Her husband, who does not have a full-time job anymore, is no longer able to  help her at home. All the household expenses rest therefore on Mrs. Kanl\u00e9 K. who, with all of her experience and the rigor which she has demonstrated in the management of her two previous loans, has been able to pull through, but not without difficulty.\r\n\r\n<p>The previous loans, which were obtained and repaid without incident, have helped her significantly and have above all contributed to increasing her business and her profitability. Currently, she is asking for a new loan of $750 which will serve to buy more of a wide range of articles which are missing in her stock.

It is bordered in the north by Tarqui parish, in the south by Jima parish of S\u00edgsig canton and the edge of Gir\u00f3n canton, to the east by the parishes of Quingeo and San Jos\u00e9 in S\u00edgsig canton, and in the west by the parish of Victoria del Portete. The leading economic activity in the area is agriculture, and the most important products are corn, potatoes, beans and milk. A large proportion of the younger population travels daily to Cuenca to work as factory employees, handicraft artisans, store employees, service workers and above all, construction workers. \n\nMar\u00eda Auxiliadora is  48 years old and lives with her two younger children, aged 15 and 12, who attend a nearby school. Her other four children are married and independent. Her husband is a mason, and through many years of sacrifice, he was able to build the family's own home in the Cumbe community. \n\nMar\u00eda Auxiliadora was one of the founding members of the communal bank, and she has been with the bank for fifteen years. She was inspired by a neighbor who belonged to an earlier group in the neighborhood which broke up. Later, this new group of hard-working and enterprising women was formed. Mar\u00eda Auxiliadora's business is buying and selling animals. She deals in guinea pigs and hens at the Cumbe markets and at Cuenca's public market. This activity has allowed her to advance economically. She has worked for 20 years in the markets on Wednesdays and Saturdays, and on the other days, she takes care of her animals. She also keeps cows, whose milk she sells to mobile distributors. With the current loan, she will buy more guinea pigs and hens to resell. \n\nHer goal is to expand her business day by day and reach the point where she can buy herself a vehicle. \n\nLuz Fern\u00e1ndez lives in the \"3 de Noviembre\" community of the Cumbe parish. She is  60 years old and was widowed 18 years ago when her husband was killed in a traffic accident. The couple had four children, who are now grown and married. Luz lives in her own house with one of her daughters who keeps her company and shares the household expenses. \n\nLuz works in agriculture; she grows corn, potatoes and a variety of vegetables. She also keeps cattle, selling the milk to mobile distributors. In addition, she raises guinea pigs and chickens. She tells us that she has been a member of the communal bank since its beginnings, that is, for the past 15 years. The loans have been beneficial for her business of buying and selling animals. With the new loan, she will buy chickens, guinea pigs and feed for her animals, as well as seeds for corn, beans, peas and other crops. \n\nHer goal is to continue working as long as her health permits. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Patricia Linderman, Kiva

She lives in a peri-urban area on the outskirts of Guayaquil called Duran which is known for its deteriorating ecosystem.\r\n\r\nAna began selling meals with some savings she had and her previous experience in the business.  She decided to set up her own lunch business.

She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2009 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her food vending business, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 7,000. Ethel is now borrowing PHP 11,000 so that she could purchase more stock to sell. This will be her 3rd loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 6,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey towards economic freedom. Ethel hopes to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well being by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\n<p>About NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from selling a variety of different products in the local community. Nelia has been engaged in her business for over 2 years and earns approximately 5,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Nelia joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Nelia has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase new items to expand product offering. Nelia is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This will be the 4th loan taken out by Nelia from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay the tuition fees of her children. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful micro-finance institutions in the Philippines. It has 38 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas.

She\u2019s been in business for 10 years and the most difficult part is putting up with the intermittent rain storms which sometimes last all day and cause her sales to drop.\r\n\r\nShe mentions that educational costs for her minor children are higher and this is why she\u2019s calling on MFP for a loan.  With the money she gets she\u2019ll travel to the capital to buy more merchandise to stock her sales stand and will use the remaining funds to pay for her beloved children\u2019s monthly tuition.  In time, she\u2019d like to start a new business; she\u2019ll go into food sales, since she\u2019s noticed that this is a good source of income.\r\n\r\nThis will be her 7th loan with MFP and she hopes to get support from all of you to be able to buy the merchandise she needs to have more profits.  She thanks her fellow communal bank members for the responsibility they have.  She will use the requested 3000 new soles to buy more shoes and sandals in the city of Lima to increase the stock she has on hand at her store.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":820157,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Shoe Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy more shoes and sandals.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-07-24T04:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1100,"lender_count":35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-06-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":386.61},{"due_date":"2011-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":397.15},{"due_date":"2011-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":411.64},{"due_date":"2011-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":426.66},{"due_date":"2011-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":443.88},{"due_date":"2011-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":459.55},{"due_date":"2012-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":474.51}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":141.76},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":145.62},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150.93},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":156.45},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":162.75},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":168.5},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":173.99}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":287.38,"local_amount":783.76,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-18T08:02:58Z","rounded_local_amount":786.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227350776},{"amount":150.93,"local_amount":411.64,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:49:08Z","rounded_local_amount":413.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232851140},{"amount":156.45,"local_amount":426.66,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:56:20Z","rounded_local_amount":428.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238666316},{"amount":162.75,"local_amount":443.88,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:42:10Z","rounded_local_amount":445.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244621474},{"amount":168.5,"local_amount":459.55,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:49:47Z","rounded_local_amount":461.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250835547},{"amount":173.99,"local_amount":474.51,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:18:45Z","rounded_local_amount":476.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257245305}],"funded_date":"2011-08-19T18:21:49Z","paid_date":"2012-02-15T11:18:45Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":324115,"name":"Carolyne","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Carolyne is 34 years old and married to David.

\n\n\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\n\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

In his business he also takes advantage of each season, so many times he sells school supplies. In December he sells toys and Christmas decorations, but he never stops selling his principal items which are the spare parts for blenders, irons, pots and other small electrical household appliances.

She has always sought to reap the best possible results from her crops and has cared for her animals in order to profit and be able to provide for her 6 children.  In addition to growing corn and peas, Beatriz raises sheep, cows, pigs, hens, and guinea pigs.

Kuku means chickens in Swahili, and raising them for sale is popular for a number of reasons. \r\n<P>First, they require little start-up capital. You can start with one or two, and add more as you go, or wait for them to multiple naturally! Second, they require little space, so sometimes you can just let them run around in your garden or compound. Third, while they are growing, they produce eggs. You can sell the eggs to provide a supplementary source of income, or eat them to provide a supplementary source of protein. There are probably many other reasons for raising kuku, but this is all time and space will allow.\r\n<p>Bernadetha requests a loan to purchase additional chicks and feed so she can increase her income.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She and her husband, Arman have four young children who range from two to four years in age and the family lives in the village of Tabao Rizal. San Enrique, Negros Occidental. \n\nAdela is 39 years old and has established herself as a skillful entrepreneur for almost 10 years since she joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1999. When she got her first loan, she invested it in food vending of Native Ilonggo delicacies such as \"bayi-bayi\" and \"kalamayhati\" which are made of rice flour, whole brown sugar and coconut milk.Over the years, her food products have become quite popular in the community to the point where the increased demand has required her husband to help with production and delivery. Larger loans made it possible for Adela to establish a networking business as well. Her income has grown to an average of PHP 10,000 per month, which has enabled her to fix her dilapidated house and set aside some savings for her children's future .Adela's products taste so good that it was selected by NWTF's Client Services Department to be one of the sugar-based products it featured in a week-long trade fair that it organized in August at SM City Bacolod, the biggest mall in Negros Occidental.  Her products were so well received by the mall shoppers that it she will be offering them again in the trade-fair rerun at SM City Bacolod this October during the Masskara Festival, which is a famous tourist event in the island.  It is expected to be one of the best and fast selling products in the trade fair.She borrowed PHP 19,500 for her previous loan and used it as additional working capital for her food vending and networking business. That loan was fully paid on time. For her next 14th cycle loan she wants to borrow the same amount of PHP 19,500 which she intends to use again as additional capital for her native foods vending and networking business.Adela is shown in the picture posing with some of the networking products that she sells.About NWTF:In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the calling of not just of a few but thousands of women. Through the alleviation program, these women have progressed from earning less than a measly $1 a day, to surpassing the realities beyond their dreams. They have learned to live a life where they can finally be called honorable.

One of them is in his fourth year of secondary school, and the other is 27 years old.  Martha has a cosmetic sales business, which she began four years ago with very little working capital, in search of an alternative source of income, since she also gives classes in a public school.  She began by selling just a few cosmetics.  Afterwards, she started to invest a little more.  This credit will be invested in the purchase of lipstick, polish, eyeshadow cases, and vanity boxes.

It is a very popular trade in Sri Lanka.\r\n\r\nIvon is seeking a 40,000 LKR loan from BRAC to buy more coir to process and sell to her currently-expanding base of customers.

With the help of her past 13 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Imelda has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 27,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 10,000, uplifting the family's standard of living.

P., 44, life couldn't be simpler. Being a CCT* community partner of Talon, Amadeo, Cavite, Philippines, Merlita employs simple but effective principles to make her business grow. She is the wife of Orlando, a laborer, and is a mother to two college students.\r\n\r\nMerlita owns a sari-sari (variety) store in her neighborhood, where she sells items that are daily needed by people in her community. When a neighbor immediately needs a bottle of vinegar, a sachet of toothpaste, or some biscuits to eat, Merlita is ready to offer her merchandise. She also sells electronic load for mobile phones. Monthly, she earns around Php10,000.\r\n\r\nTo help her grow her business, Merlita is requesting for a Php20,000 loan. This is one simple way of energizing her business--adding to the array of items she has in her store to attract more customers with more options and to further meet their needs. She believes that with this loan money, she can undoubtedly increase her profits and make her store grow.\r\n\r\nOne challenge Merlita faces recently is the number of customers who do not pay their debts. She is also challenged by competition in the neighborhood, since many households in the Philippines put up a small sari-sari store to augment the family income. However, Merlita believes that challenges can be met by simply having faith in the Lord and exerting her best effort. She does not give up, because she knows that soon, the days will be brighter for her, both in her personal life and in her business. Just like any other parent, Merlita's simple dream is to see her children finish schooling.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":666709,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Purchase

Together they try to get ahead in life.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda has been selling nutritional products for 15 years.  She also currently sells purified water by the glass.  The water has the effect of lowering weight which means that she has more women as customers than men.  It is currently summer which means that her business is very popular.

What she most likes about her business is the guidance that she gives to her customers since she really enjoys chatting to her customers.\r\n\r\nIn the future, Mar\u00eda plans to diversify her business, buying a sewing machine so that she can realize her frustrated dreams of becoming a seamstress and mending clothes.

Los 4 viven en una casa propia en la comunidad nativa de Pucharini. Magaly e Iv\u00e1n se dedican a la agricultura desde que empezaron a convivir, con la siembra de caf\u00e9, pl\u00e1tanos, frutas c\u00edtricas, papayas, yucas y cocona. A parte de eso Magaly prepara anticuchos y los vende por las noches en la puerta de su hogar. Por su parte Iv\u00e1n, cuando no est\u00e1 en el campo, trabaja en construcci\u00f3n civil de carreteras y obras p\u00fablicas. Por la lejan\u00eda de sus terrenos, el acceso para llegar sus cosechas, dificulta y demora el traslado de las mismas, por esa raz\u00f3n no dudan al momento de contratar personal, siendo para ellos uno de sus principales obst\u00e1culos dentro de su actividad. M\u00e1s adelante le gustar\u00eda abrir un negocio en el que compre pl\u00e1tanos al por mayor de los comuneros de su zona e introducirlos en la ciudad de Lima para venderlos a mayor precio.

They have two children who are now 6 and 3 years of age.  The four of them live in their own home in their native community of Pucharini.  Magaly and Iv\u00e1n have been farming since they have been together.  They grow coffee, bananas, citrus fruits, papayas, cassava, and coconuts.  In addition, Magaly prepares grilled meats and then sells them in the evenings from the doorstep of her home.  When he is not working in the fields, Iv\u00e1n works in highway construction and on other public projects.  Due to the distance it takes to get to their land, accessing and transporting their crops can be difficult and result in delays.  For this reason, they do not hesitate to hire workers since this is one of the main obstacles of this business.  Going forward, Magaly would like to open a business selling bananas in bulk from the local villagers and introducing them into the city of Lima where she can sell them at a higher price.  By her calculations, this venture would be profitable.\r\n<p>\r\nThis would be her fourth loan with MFP once she receives everyone\u2019s support.  Magaly promises to complete her payments on time and work hand-in-hand with the organization and her Communal Bank, where she feels supported and trusted.

She is from Kitale, Kenya where the earth is red and smells fresh from the rain. The trees are lush, and tiny, matchbox-like, mud brick houses with tin roofs line both sides of the dirt roads. For the past 27 years, Jane has been involved in mixed farming. Her primary sources of income have been milk, eggs, and some personal business she engages in to make extra cash. \r\n\r\nJane has been able to provide nutritious food for her family. She passionately loves poultry farming. \u201cChicken is part of me. I sleep chicken, I walk chicken, I love chicken, I eat chicken,\u201d she says. The biggest challenge she faces is a lack of capital to buy additional poultry birds. She requested a loan from Juhudi Kilimo, which she will use to purchase high-quality breeds of poultry that are resistant to diseases and lay more eggs. She believes the excess maize she has will be used to feed the poultry, and sorghum will be used to give the poultry energy and green grams used for protein. \r\n\r\nThrough better feeding, the poultry will increase their egg production and will lay more eggs of good quality, which will translate to more income. With this loan Jane will also benefit from fertilizer as the droppings have a lot of nitrogen. With the additional income, Jane will be able to support her family and improve their living conditions.\r\n"}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1821945,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to purchase additional poultry.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kitale","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1.016667 35","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":725,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jane","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-03T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":65000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":4600.24},{"due_date":"2015-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":4734.68},{"due_date":"2015-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":4873.05},{"due_date":"2015-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":5015.46},{"due_date":"2015-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":5162.04},{"due_date":"2015-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":5312.9},{"due_date":"2015-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":5468.17},{"due_date":"2015-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":5627.98},{"due_date":"2015-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":5792.46},{"due_date":"2015-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":5961.75},{"due_date":"2016-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":6135.97},{"due_date":"2016-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":6315.3}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.31},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.81},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.35},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.94},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.58},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.26},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.99},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.77},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":64.61},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.5},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.44},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.44}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Deb Hickman","image":null}},{"id":992864,"name":"Haitham","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Greetings from Palestine!

From a tender age, she began all sorts of businesses, but finally decided to specialize in the buying and selling of Soumbala (a natural seasoning of multiple virtues made from the African locust nut) which she learned early on from her grandmother (as do most women of her ethnicity: the Minianka). She has been selling out of her home for 20 years. To secure complementary financial resources, she has turned to microfinance institution Soro Yiriwaso for the last 4 years. After having properly repaid her previous loans (3 group loans and 2 individual loans), she is on her third individual loan. Mrs. Nanou plans to buy with this loan 40 baskets of semi-transformed Soumbala in Koutiala at the weekly fairs from women coming from the villages. Afterwards, she fully transforms it in her way to make it more presentable with several employees. She sells her goods in the city of Bamako (capital of Mali) and Koutiala to a female clientele for cash or credit. She hopes to make a monthly profit of 140,000 CFA francs, which she plans to use to repay the loan and take care of her children. She plans to look for a spot at the Dabanani market in Bamako in order to grow her business.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Sherry W., Kiva

Her husband is the one who focuses on the business, while she helps him in his activities.\r\n\r\nAccording to Elizabeth, her loan from Kiva field partner Ahon sa Hirap Inc.

She will use her 5th loan again to buy things needed in expanding their fish cage.\r\n\r\nElizabeth together with her husband hopes that their children will finish their studies; they believe in the

G. es se\u00f1or de 43 a\u00f1os de edad, el cual vive   con su esposa y su hijo, en una comunidad llamada El Sauce de Santa Teresita de Turrialba, Provincia de Cartago.  Es una peque\u00f1a comunidad rural de aproximadamente dos mil habitantes. Sus pobladores se dedican a la producci\u00f3n de leche y siembra de caf\u00e9. Tiene un relieve irregular y mucho del terreno se mantiene como bosque tropical h\u00famedo. La comunidad tiene paisajes muy pintorescos que combinan el bosque tropical con dos lindas lagunas, plantaciones de caf\u00e9 y lecher\u00edas. El Sauce se localiza aproximadamente a hora y media en bus de Turrialba, el centro de comercio m\u00e1s cercano. Sin embargo, varias veces al a\u00f1o el camino se vuelve intransitable por las lluvias que azotan la zona. Este es sin duda uno de los principales desaf\u00edos para la comunidad. \n\nCuando no exist\u00edan actividades muchas personas optaron por salir a buscar trabajos en Turrialba o en fincas bananeras ubicadas en la Zona Atl\u00e1ntica de Costa Rica.

G. is 43 years old. He lives with his wife and son in a community called El Sauce in Santa Teresita de Turrialba, Province of Cartago. This is a small rural community with around two thousand people. They are work producing milk and growing coffee. It has an irregular terrain and a lot of it is maintained as humid tropical forest. The community has traditional landscapes that mix with the tropical forest, with two nice lagoons, coffee plantations and milk factories. El Sauce is located about an hour and a half from Turrialba, the closest commercial center. However, several times a year, the road is closed due to the heavy rain in the area. This is without a doubt one of the main challenges of the community.\r\nWhen there was nothing to do in town, a lot of people decided to go to Turrialba for work or to banana farms in the Atlantic coast in Costa Rica. Right now, coffee and milk prices have improves, so the neighbors are looking for ways to invest their money in the area and avoid migrations.\r\nFray is a milk producer. This way he obtains an income to support his family. He says he's very happy because due to this project he has been able to make a living. He sells his milk to the cheese manufacturing company that works for the El Sauce\u2019s Milk Producer\u2019s Association.\r\nFray would like to get a \u00a2640.00 loan (six hundred and forty colones) to purchase a milking cow and increase the production of milk. He wants to be a successful entrepreneur to help his family. This motivates him to make sacrifices and work hard.\r\n\r\nFray is a member of the El Sauce Farmers Association, one of the 100 member organizations of EDESA in Costa Rica. This will be his first loan. He hopes to continue growing at a personal level and financial level. He also believes it\u2019s important to mention that thanks to these type of organizations she is able to devote more time to productive activities.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by

She lives in her own house with her family, and is not financially responsible for anyone else.\r\n\r\nShe moved from Inhambane to Namaacha when her husband was transferred, and they set up a new home where they still live today. She's had her own business for more than 20 years. She doesn't have employees, and relies on her husband for assistance. She sells cornmeal, tomatoes, and onions, and brings in about 5000 meticals, which she reinvests in her business. She is not able to save anything and depends on her husband's pension.\r\n\r\nShe's never had loans with other institutions. She heard about Hluvuku through a friend who is also a client. This is her second loan with Hluvuku and her first with Kiva. She is requesting 15,000 meticals to buy essentials and increase the amount of stock she can carry.\r\n\r\nShe's committed to paying this loan off on time so that she'll be eligible for others in the future. Her dream is to have her own shop, and will request additional loans to prepare a space in her home.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Andrea Rosenberg, Kiva

Bukang Liwayway, Brgy. Tanglaw, Puerto Princesa, Palawan. She earns her living by operating four business ventures: building rental, pension houses, tricycle operator and a general store.  \r\n\r\nErlinda joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2004 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 14 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Erlinda has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 23,000 Philippine pesos (PHP) helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 3,800, thus uplifting the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 15th loan cycle, she is borrowing PHP 15,000, which she intends to use to pay for building maintenance that will be very helpful in her business and to continue to save up for future house renovation. Erlinda H. is a Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means \"honorable\") woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\n<b>About NWTF:<\/b>  \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon. Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.
