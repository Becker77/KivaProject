She is 54 years old. Delia is married and has 7 children. To make a living, Delia owns and operates a business venture in the retail sector, running a general store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling daily use products such as shampoo, soap, and toothpaste in the local community. Delia has been engaged in her business for over 3 years now.\r\n\r\nDelia joined CEVI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Delia is requesting a new loan of 6,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Delia from CEVI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve her business and supplement the family's income.\r\n\r\nAbout CEVI:\r\n\r\nCommunity Economic Ventures, Inc (CEVI) has increased its portfolio significantly over the recent years. Based in Bohol, they have numerous branches throughout the Philippines. In 2009, CEVI was awarded a CGAP silver award for transparency in social performance monitoring. CEVI not only provides credit for its clients but additionally savings, insurance, and training which are provided through regular cluster group meetings.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Unlike many of her peers she always knew exactly what she wants to do in life. When she chose her profession Sypaada was not driven by prestige or the demand of the profession, but rather by what she had a real aptitude for and what gave her gratification. She became a hairdresser.\r\n\r\nWhen she was seventeen Sypaada finished a school of image making and hairdressing. Two years of working with experienced specialists in the country's capital helped her when she moved back to her home town of Toktogul to share her skills with her colleagues. Daily long hour shifts have increased her clientele base. Thus the monthly income for Sypaada is now 10000 soms. With more services offered in her salon there are more expenses. Most expenses include equipment, instruments and supplies. Sypaada plans to spend this loan mainly on buying additional instruments for the salon. Her biggest dream is to open her own beauty salon with highest quality service.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":850,"image":{"id":733251,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty Salon","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to buy supplies for the hairdressing salon","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Toktogul","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":135,"posted_date":"2011-03-17T21:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":850,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sypaada","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"\u0410\u0437\u0438\u0437\u0431\u0435\u043a","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"\u0414\u0438\u043b\u043e\u0440\u0430\u043c","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-03-03T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":40000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":4248},{"due_date":"2011-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":4535},{"due_date":"2011-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":4677},{"due_date":"2011-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":4837},{"due_date":"2011-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":5111},{"due_date":"2011-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":5320},{"due_date":"2011-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":5506},{"due_date":"2011-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":5766}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.27},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.37},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":99.39},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.78},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":108.61},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":113.05},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":117},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":122.53}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":90.27,"local_amount":4248,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:30:51Z","rounded_local_amount":4283.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206192752},{"amount":96.37,"local_amount":4535,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-17T08:04:02Z","rounded_local_amount":4573.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211571556},{"amount":663.36,"local_amount":31217,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:30:34Z","rounded_local_amount":31480.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216546216}],"funded_date":"2011-03-18T02:49:57Z","paid_date":"2011-07-15T11:30:35Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Elena Fedorchuk","image":1104450}},{"id":286876,"name":"Anonymous","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This Kiva borrower is a 40-year-old single woman living with one parent and two siblings.

Before the first sun\u2019s rays appear she leaves her house and walks nearly an hour to reach her fields where she has cocoa beans, coffee and hardwood trees planted - products that she subsequently takes to various gathering sites.  \r\n\r\nWhat she most likes about her work is cultivating her fields because she feels she\u2019s putting them to good use.  She\u2019s been in this activity for 10 years and considers the most difficult part having to transport her products because the sacks she carries are very heavy and they tire her out quite a bit.

P. is a single, 61 years old woman.  She has no children, just one nephew in her care that is 17 years old and in his 4th year of secondary school.  Alba doesn't have a partner in life. Her  purpose is to keep her business active so that it continues to earn her income in spite of the increase in the cost of gas, now that she has to go through the streets looking for passengers.  Alba hopes to acquire another vehicle so that her nephew can manage it and get experience in this type of business. That way, he'll have another means of work so he can help himself in the days to come. She hopes that the quality of life in her country will improve, given that the help of other donor countries is so important, since it supports the people that really need it.\r\n\r\nHer main economic activity is providing taxi services, and it is located throughout the city. She has four years of experience at her work. Alba started this business as an alternative way of earning money. She got the taxi service by selling a business selling whole grains that she had in the wholesale market of Bisne in Managua and through other necessary financing arrangements.  Alba didn't have a lot of knowledge about this type of business at first, so the person she hired as the driver turned in very little money and didn't distribute the earnings.  With the help of her family, she managed to find a reliable person for this job. Over time, she has gained experience in the business, but she still needs the requested financing to fund the business so that she can make improvements to her vehicle, including changing the radiator, tires, and other things.  She acknowledges the support of Fundaci\u00f3n Le\u00f3n 2000 and its sister organizations.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Shannon Skoglund, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":259891,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Taxi","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"Repairs to her vehicle","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Leon","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.435556 -86.879444","type":"point"}},"partner_id":96,"posted_date":"2009-01-22T15:40:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":525,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alba Esperanza","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-19T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":9900,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":900},{"due_date":"2009-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":900},{"due_date":"2009-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":900},{"due_date":"2009-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":900},{"due_date":"2009-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":900},{"due_date":"2009-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":900},{"due_date":"2009-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":900},{"due_date":"2009-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":900},{"due_date":"2009-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":900},{"due_date":"2009-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":900},{"due_date":"2009-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":900}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":47.73},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":47.73},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.73},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.73},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.73},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.73},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.73},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.73},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.73},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.73},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.7}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":47.73,"local_amount":900,"processed_date":"2009-02-19T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T08:41:23Z","rounded_local_amount":941.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20399998},{"amount":47.73,"local_amount":900,"processed_date":"2009-03-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T18:36:29Z","rounded_local_amount":941.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27091996},{"amount":47.72,"local_amount":900,"processed_date":"2009-04-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T16:39:26Z","rounded_local_amount":941.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35985379},{"amount":47.73,"local_amount":900,"processed_date":"2009-05-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T23:10:24Z","rounded_local_amount":941.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44445995},{"amount":47.73,"local_amount":900,"processed_date":"2009-06-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T20:39:54Z","rounded_local_amount":941.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52956636},{"amount":286.36,"local_amount":5400,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-18T09:06:13Z","rounded_local_amount":5647.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63174062}],"funded_date":"2009-01-22T18:16:14Z","paid_date":"2009-08-18T09:06:13Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Shannon Skoglund","image":836314}},{"id":89371,"name":"Lim's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This small loan group is made up of four members, all residents of Chong Kneas Commune, Siem Reap Province.

Maureen enjoys her work and is dedicated to helping non-profit organizations use media to effectively disseminate their message. \r\n\r\nShe heard the same response from many banks, which was that they couldn\u2019t lend to a business of her size at this time. Given that she needed capital to sustain and to help grow her business, Maureen decided to look into microfinance options and so she came to ACCION USA. With her loan, Maureen is hiring a new employee to help grow the business\u2019 client base. She will also use a portion of the loan to cover the costs associated with developing new partnerships with other media companies to initiate new projects. \r\n\r\nMaureen has established her business and created a loyal clientele that depends on her for their media needs.

The group is located in the city of Cuenca, where they can enjoy the natural beauty of the city where the surrounding mountain range and plentiful vegetation forge a unique landscape. The locals make a living in agriculture, livestock and also making hand-woven sombreros.\r\n\r\nRosa is 40 years old and has been separated from her husband for seven years, after he left to work on the Ecuadorian coast and found someone else. She had eight children from her marriage, one of whom is married and independent, two who work in the city at a construction office and help with expenses, one who is out of school but helps with the house, and the other four are still young and in school. She owns her home, which is small and made of adobe but still provides security. She makes a living in agricultural, cultivating the land and occasionally hiring workers. She also raises animal and has a cow, a sheep and chickens, which she sells only when she's in some economic trouble. This is her second loan cycle working with her community bank, and with the money she plans to purchase a pig to raise, fatten and sell. Her dream is to better herself more everyday, increase her number of livestock and fix her house up little by little.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda C. lives in Taguan in the Sigsig area, which is located only 7 kilometers from Castillo De Chobshi, which is a popular architectural structure. She is 56 years old, married and has eight children. One of her daughters committed suicide, orphaning her two children, who are now under Mar\u00eda's care and going to the community school. Five of Mar\u00eda's children live in the city of Cuenca and the others left in search of better opportunities and almost never come to visit. For now, she only lives with her 14-year-old son, who helps around the house, her two grandchildren and her husband, who is a construction worker in the city center and only comes home on weekends. They have a small home that they own. Mar\u00eda raises animals such as pigs, chickens, guinea pigs and cattle, and only sells them during times of economic trouble. She also makes a living harvesting vegetables and selling them in the city of Cuenca. This is her second loan cycle with the community bank, and with the first one she purchased chicken that are now ready to sell, and with the new loan she plans to purchase pigs to fatten and then sell. Her dream is to be able to have more cows so she can sell their milk and make cheeses.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Marty Greenstein, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2875,"image":{"id":513516,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Purchase animals to raise and sell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Cuenca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2010-03-25T02:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2875,"lender_count":88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"  Nancy Marlene","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"  Hilda Mar\u00eda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"  Ana Lucia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":" Maria Rosa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"  Rosa Elvira","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Maria Rosario","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Rosa Claudina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"  Marianita De Jesus","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-08T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":2860,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":2875,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":238.33},{"due_date":"2010-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":238.33},{"due_date":"2010-04-29T07:00:00Z","amount":238.33},{"due_date":"2010-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":238.33},{"due_date":"2010-05-27T07:00:00Z","amount":238.33},{"due_date":"2010-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":238.33},{"due_date":"2010-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":238.33},{"due_date":"2010-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":238.33},{"due_date":"2010-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":238.33},{"due_date":"2010-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":238.33},{"due_date":"2010-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":238.33},{"due_date":"2010-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":238.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":239.58},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":239.58},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":239.58},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":239.58},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":239.58},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":239.58},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":239.58},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":239.58},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":239.58},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":239.58},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":239.58},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":239.62}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":666.48,"local_amount":663,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:18:47Z","rounded_local_amount":666.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136674821},{"amount":291.84,"local_amount":290.32,"processed_date":"2010-05-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:16:43Z","rounded_local_amount":291.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144709000},{"amount":239.58,"local_amount":238.33,"processed_date":"2010-05-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:16:53Z","rounded_local_amount":239.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144709001},{"amount":239.58,"local_amount":238.33,"processed_date":"2010-06-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:46:37Z","rounded_local_amount":239.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151892297},{"amount":239.58,"local_amount":238.33,"processed_date":"2010-06-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:46:45Z","rounded_local_amount":239.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151892298},{"amount":479.16,"local_amount":476.66,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:10:43Z","rounded_local_amount":479.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159632673},{"amount":479.16,"local_amount":476.66,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:14:55Z","rounded_local_amount":479.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166846731},{"amount":239.62,"local_amount":238.37,"processed_date":"2010-09-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:06:57Z","rounded_local_amount":239.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172113251}],"funded_date":"2010-03-29T02:40:03Z","paid_date":"2010-10-15T10:06:57Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Marty Greenstein","image":null}},{"id":192646,"name":"Hung","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Hung D.

She has worked the past three years for the City of Juigalpa as a property tax surveyor.  Evelin is requesting her first loan with hopes of acquiring her own home since she currently does not have one.  However, she does have a plot of land on which to build.  Evelin is enrolled in a housing program that will help her with the construction, but she needs to make a down payment in order for the work to begin.  The problem is that she lacks the necessary funds.  For this reason, she is depending on the support of AFODENIC and Kiva so that she can continue in the program.\r\n<p>\r\nHer greatest wish is to have her own house and make improvements to it so that

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Then her husband came down with a heart condition, and he could no longer work. They decided to invest their capital by buying small commercial properties and then renting them out. This was due to a stroke of good luck, because a friend of her husband\u2019s offered them a piece of land at a good price and they were able to buy it. They began by building one small property and with the rent they received from that, they continued building. They now have 4 properties.<p>Columba is requesting a loan of $550.00 to remodel and make some repairs at one of their properties. They would also like to put a bathroom in another building, because it doesn\u2019t have one. She offers to repay the loan in 5 months.

She is the group leader of a 6-member group loan offered by ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is Romelia F.'s Group.\r\n\r\nRomelia is 45 years old, is married and has two school-aged children. To make a living, she owns and operates a business venture in the retail sector running a general store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from selling a variety of different products in the local community. Romelia has been engaged in her business for over two years and earns approximately 7,000 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Romelia joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 15,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional products to sell. Romelia is requesting a new loan of 20,000 PHP which will be used to purchase new items to expand the products offered. This will be the fourth loan she has taken out from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the central and north-eastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

He and his wife are dairy farmers and they have a three year old son.\r\n\r\nHe is a very responsible person who is dedicated to the work he does.  He has four head of dairy cattle.  He has been in this line of work since he was very young because his mother did the same.  Because he is the youngest sibling he was always at her side working with her.  Juan Carlos\u2019 mother died six years ago due to an illness she fought against since she was a little girl and got Chagas disease.  This is a disease she fought against for many years but still she was always struggling together with her children to get ahead since their father abandoned them when they were children.\r\n\r\nJuan Carlos struggles daily and values the sacrifice his mother made for his sisters and for himself.  He is asking for funds to buy a truckload of soy husks which is the feed for his cattle so that he can generate higher income and produce more milk.  He currently extracts 150 liters of milk daily which he delivers to his mother-in-law to make \u201cquesillo\u201d (small fresh farm cheese popular in the Cochabamba valley.)\r\n\r\nJuan Carlos wants a better future for his son.  This is why he works from very early in the morning and does other farming chores.  He and his wife want to get married in the not too distant future and work together to help their son study a professional career and have a better future than he has had.\r\n<br

Then, to bolster his business, he made use of a $550 loan, which he repaid without a problem.  An efficient man, he has complete mastery of his business.

Kankovi is married and the mother of three children. Her husband is a taxi driver. She was forced to leave school at a very early age because of a lack of support and is now starting to produce and sell cakes. To do this she is using the funds earned from selling chilled water, something she did previously. Her production capacity in the beginning was limited to a few bowls of flour and two litres of vegetable oil. She is seeing the demand for her cakes increase and wants to expand her business by buying bags of wheat flour, drums of vegetable oil and firewood. To do this she is asking for a loan of $700 to increase her production and revenue, thus improving the living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from French by Susan Bell, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nN\u00e9e \u00e0 Aklakou en 1959, Madame A.

Kda village in Kampong Chhnang province and all the members will use the loan for a different purpose. Mr. Sarum P. is a pig breeder. Since this business is going well, he wants to expand it so he decided to ask for a loan to buy three more piglets for breeding. His wife, Mrs. Sok Than, is a farmer who owns a small piece of land to cultivate rice to earn a living. Mr. Sarum P. is 50 years old and the father of four children, one of whom is working in a garment factory while the remaining three are attending the local school. \r\n<p>\r\nThis is a village bank loan consisting of mainly end-of-term loans. Twelve members have end-of-term loans and the rest have monthly payment loans. These clients are not required to pay any principal on the loan until the very end of the loan term. End-of-term (EoT) loans are AMK\u2019s main product because it is the most beneficial to Cambodia\u2019s poor. It allows them to repay portions of the principal whenever they are financially able to. Most clients start to make payments many months before the end of the loan term. Almost all of AMK\u2019s clients make their payments on time. AMK has a delinquency rate of only 0.09% and AMK has a default rate of 0% on Kiva.

M. and Em\u00e9rita G. Hern\u00e1ndez. They live in the Altos region, a rural area in Nindir\u00ed province.\r\n\r\nThe coordinator of the group is 45 year old Mar\u00eda Esther S.. She has 5 children ages 25, 24, 22, 20 and 17 years old, of whom the youngest three are still with her and studying in school. She began a bakery business at a young age with her mother who taught her this business and Mar\u00eda really enjoys it.\r\n\r\nToday she works with her children in the bakery and needs to invest in buying ingredients such as flour, eggs, milk, baking powder, butter, yeast, and food coloring. Her greatest goal is having an adequate locale for her bakery business.\r\n\r\nThe other members of the group include Mercedes G. M..

The official name of this borrowing group is \"Capatan Group\".\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nJulie is married and has two adult children. To make a living, Julie owns and operates a business making and selling food.

Julie is just starting this business.\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2009, Julie joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Julie is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Julie from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\n<p>\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs. \r\n\r\n<p>\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She is 59 years old. Maxima is married and has 6 adult-aged children. To make a living, Maxima owns & operates a business venture in the retail sector operating a general store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling a variety of different products in the local community. Maxima has been engaged in her business for over 15 years and earns approximately 6,000 PHP a month for these activities.\n\nIn 2005, Maxima joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Maxima has successfully repaid a previous loan of 16,000 PHP from ASKI. Maxima is requesting a new loan of 17000 PHP which will be used to purchase new items to expand product offering. This loan will be the fourth loan taken out by Maxima from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand the borrower's business. \n\nAbout ASKI:\n\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\n\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":465921,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

She has a long term partner, four children and lives in San Pedro de Macoris, a city famous for baseball players and sugar cane industries. The main economic activity here is the free trading zone, a cement factory, and other businesses. This area, like nearly all impoverished areas of the Dominican Republic, suffers from unreliable running water (none of which is potable) and electricity.\r\n\r\nFor around seven years Alexandra has operated a colmado, a shop where you can find basic food staples. Colmados are within short walking distances from neighborhood homes. She started her business with a loan she receive from a friend. She plans to use this loan to buy rice, flour and other foods. She will use the profits to reinvest in her business, like her other eight loans. She wants to work. She says, \"now I have the strength to work harder. For my future, I want to have a better life, to live tranquil and safe.\r\n\r\nAlexandra says that her biggest goal is to have her own house. In the meantime, she plans to continue enjoying to survive and to serve with her business. Her story is generally representative of her group and of Esperanza's Haitian and Dominican clients, many of whom recently emigrated to the Dominican Republic from Haiti.

She earns her living by selling garlic, onions and spices. Her husband Jerry, who is 54 years old, works as a vendor to earn his living and helps in his wife's business activities. They have two children who are 7 and 13 years old, respectively. Rosalie joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2004 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 17 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Rosalie has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 20,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 15,000, uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 18th loan, she is borrowing PHP 20,000, which she intends to use to purchase more stock to sell so that she can continue to save up for the future and for her children\u2019s education. D. C. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

The country is home to epic mountain passes, communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Today it remains a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war that ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R. further damaged its already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n<p>\r\n<b>About IMON International <\/b>\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

","en":"The \u201cVirgen de Cotoca\u201d Group, represented by Ms. Carolina, is comprised of 12 very dynamic members who wish to participate in activities together to fraternize and become more unified as a group. As they are neighbors, the women have had a friendship for a very long time. They all partake in various commercial and service activities, such as beauty salons, general stores, food sales, and cosmetics. One member has a general store, and when there are concerts in the area, he sells beverages at the venue. Ms. Carolina has her own beverage business, but would like to diversify her products. The majority of group members have stands in front of their homes, and the rest are street vendors. Despite all the adversities that they face, they know how to get ahead because their families depend on it. Concerning competition, we can say that it is high, but when it gets too tough, the group members simply move their stands away from the central market, thus boosting their sales. This loan will be used to restock their shops, purchase work materials and supplies in bulk, and the members who sell cosmetics will take advantage of the ongoing sales. Their greatest hope is to expand their stands to generate greater revenues so that they can offer their children a better future and quality of life. Despite the fact that this is their first loan cycle, the group members already have previous experience working in solidarity groups thanks to financial institutes similar to Fundaci\u00f3n Agocapital, to which they are very grateful for their trust and monetary support.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Elizabeth Casian, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2575,"image":{"id":423330,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"Working capital ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-17 -65","type":"point"}},"partner_id":73,"posted_date":"2009-11-19T08:10:16Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2575,"lender_count":91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Carolina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosio Daniela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Adriana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Raquel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Skharlem","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Silvia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Paola","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Justina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gladys Beatriz","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Antonia Gladys","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gladys","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juan Pedro","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-10-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":18000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":2575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":2160.94},{"due_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":2185.8},{"due_date":"2009-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":2210.95},{"due_date":"2009-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":2236.4},{"due_date":"2010-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":2262.13},{"due_date":"2010-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":2288.16},{"due_date":"2010-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":2314.49},{"due_date":"2010-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":2341.13}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":309.13},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":312.7},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":316.28},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":319.93},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":323.61},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":327.34},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":331.1},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":334.91}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":309.13,"local_amount":2160.94,"processed_date":"2009-11-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T12:27:55Z","rounded_local_amount":2170.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103788590},{"amount":312.7,"local_amount":2185.8,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T12:28:48Z","rounded_local_amount":2195.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103788591},{"amount":316.28,"local_amount":2210.95,"processed_date":"2009-12-14T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T13:09:21Z","rounded_local_amount":2220.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110678760},{"amount":319.93,"local_amount":2236.4,"processed_date":"2009-12-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T13:10:48Z","rounded_local_amount":2245.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110678761},{"amount":320.49,"local_amount":2240.32,"processed_date":"2010-01-08T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:27:27Z","rounded_local_amount":2249.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118073250},{"amount":661.31,"local_amount":4622.74,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:28:10Z","rounded_local_amount":4642.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118073251},{"amount":0.25,"local_amount":1.72,"processed_date":"2010-02-08T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:00:39Z","rounded_local_amount":1.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123909138},{"amount":334.91,"local_amount":2341.13,"processed_date":"2010-02-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:01:11Z","rounded_local_amount":2351.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123909139}],"funded_date":"2009-11-21T19:52:38Z","paid_date":"2010-03-15T10:01:11Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Elizabeth Casian","image":845142}},{"id":155142,"name":"Touch","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Touch S. lives in the Pour Ta Mouk village in Takeo province.

For many years this town has been famous for fishing. In previous times, this town was Rybachyi, which means Fishermen. Janyl J. is one of the citizens of this historical town. She is the elder daughter in her family, and that\u2019s why she has more responsibility for the things which happen around her. As the eldest one, she has leadership qualities. After graduating from school with the help of her parents, who gave her 20,000 KGS ($445), she opened up a little business by renting a pavilion which later on became a bigger one. Now the turnover is 150,000 KGS ($3,335) and there is no more renting because they have their own pavilion. Her business is selling carpets and rugs. She sells them in the new market of Balykchy town. She is married and has a child. Her husband helps her in her business and supports her as well in life. Their revenue is about 30,000 KGS ($665). The future plans are to open another pavilion where they would sell domestic appliances. Now they decided to take out a loan to buy a new gas cooker and new oven, as the previous ones are too old.\r\n\r\nAynur DJ. is a forty-nine-year-old, married woman whose husband takes across passengers. She has two children, both age  fifteen and attending the local school. About three years ago they started baking spice cakes and selling them in Bishkek. They began this business with 10,000 KGS ($225). They are planning to increase their experience by expanding their assortment. At the present time, they make two kinds of pastries, and the turnover is about 20,000 ($445). They want a loan to buy coloring agents, flour, sugar and cake boxes.\r\n\r\nChynar A. is forty-one years old and a married woman. She has three children. The elder son is a student and a daughter is a schoolgirl.  The youngest one is at home. Her husband works as an electrician in a company. She is planning to trade with fish and provide education for her children as well, but now she works in a confectionery. Her salary is 2,000 KGS ($45). She wants a loan to make her plan come true by investing money to grow.\r\n\r\nKaiyrkul K. is thirty-two and a married woman. She has a husband who works in the construction business and has a salary of from 2,000 to 3,000 KGS ($45 to $65).  She has three daughters who attend the local school. Like every parent, she wants to provide for education for her children in the future.  Now she works in a confectionery for 2,000 KGS ($45) per month, but it is not enough. That is why she wants a loan to trade with fish as well.\r\n\r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance, a young and ambitious socially-focused MFI in Kyrgyzstan.\r\n\r\nMol Bulak Finance is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development on the basis of the 3-Ps concept - People (building human capital and taking care of its customers and the society as well), Profit (to be profitable to grow further) and the Planet (taking care of the environment).

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

She wants to buy them in a large quantity so that she can receive a better price, sell more, and earn larger commissions for her sales, and in this way help her family to get ahead.

She lives with the father of her three children in her own house.  Since she was very young she has been doing agricultural work like planting potatoes, peas, and beans.  Of all of her crops, beans are the easiest to gather.  Even though the potatoes and peas require much more physical effort, they are much more profitable.\r\n\r\nEvery day Mayela gets up very early to get breakfast ready.  By eight in the morning she has to be working the fields with her husband.  When it is time to water her crops, she does not sleep.  She starts at nine at night and waters until one or two in the morning.  This is the turn given to her by the water rights board in her community.\r\n\r\nThis is how she works her crops, and she does so with much affection.  She knows that thanks to them, she receives the income to support her family and educate her children.\r\n\r\nBy doing well in the next and future harvests, Mayela hopes to be able to acquire irrigated land.\r\n\r\nThis is her eighth loan with MFP.  During the previous seven loan cycles she has shown that she makes her payments on time.  She tries to attend all of her community bank\u2019s meetings, where she feels very comfortable being with her colleagues.\r\n\r\nThe money she is asking for is to buy chemical fertilizers and a bag of better quality pea seeds. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":353006,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Buy seeds and fertilizer","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-07-16T15:10:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mayela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-06-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":350}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":350,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2009-12-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T15:23:16Z","rounded_local_amount":1057,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734054}],"funded_date":"2009-07-16T18:03:56Z","paid_date":"2010-01-15T15:23:16Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ginny Kalish"}},{"id":126299,"name":"Srey","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Srey M. is a farmer in Chroy Slaeng village in Takeo province.

It is located in the Cuautlapan community, in the municipality of Ixtaczoquitlan in the state of VeraC., Mexico. The group is maD. up of 13 members. Alejandra O. M. is the president of the group - she sells snacks (peanuts, seeds, pork scratchings) and she has asked for 3,000 pesos with which to buy ingredients to prepare her snacks. Also in the group is Mrs. Rosa Maria C. F. who is 34 years old and only went to primary school. She makes and sells tamales, which she sells in the streets from a cart. On Wednesdays she sells them together with her husband who works in the same business. They have been selling tamales for 21 years and she is asking for a loan in order to buy plantain leaves in which to wrap the tamales. She is married and has 4 children of 19, 17, 15 and 12 years of age. She began selling tamales from her house but after the birth of her children she needed to go out with her husband into the street to sell them and increase their sales. This business is the family's only source of income; thanks to the business they have been able to build a house on land they inherited and educate their children, all of whom are currently studying and also helping to sell tamales. As well as buying a small second-hand van to use to transport the tricycle from which they sell their tamales to other communities and increase their sales, she dreams of one day buying some land and having rooms for rent and securing a future for when she can no longer work, and perhaps buying a new car. All of this will help to grow her business thanks to loans. <p> The other members of this group and their occupations are: <p> Elizabeth H. F., selling clothes; <p>  Guadalupe Fidelia R.
