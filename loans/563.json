She knows how to overcome the problems that life presents and despite having few opportunities for paid work, she has never given up looking for ways to support herself. She started practicing mixed farming 10 years ago. Although she has only farmed for the past ten years, she is working hard and learning good farming practices. Through the profits she makes, she has been able to take care of her family and provide the basic needs for her children. \n\nMetrine lives near Chepchoina in the Kitale area of Kenya, an area with good weather patterns and favorable weather conditions that support farming. Maize is a very common crop in Kenya and is a staple food for many who regularly eat \u201cugali,\u201c or hard porridge cooked from maize. One can usually buy sifted maize flour in the market, but its cost is higher because of the processing. Flour can be less expensive, however, if it is milled directly using a posho mill. The Chepchoina area has only one diesel posho mill that serves a great number of people. The main problem here is that the posho mill keeps breaking down so farmers cannot grind their maize. \n\nMetrine intends to change this by buying another posho mill to serve the area. She will buy an electric, rather than diesel, posho mill, as they are more reliable. Hopefully breakdowns will be few and far between. To accomplish this, Margaret is applying for a 100,000 KES loan through Juhudi Kilimo to buy a mill. \n\nProfits derived from the mill will be used to comfortably repay the loan. In the next two years, Metrine sees herself established and running more than one posho mill. She patiently waits for your kindness. Her dream is to build a modern house for her family.\n"}},"status":"inactive","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":2027182,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy an electric posho (cornmeal) mill","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kitale","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1.016667 35","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Metrine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-11-11T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":100000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":2933.06},{"due_date":"2016-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":3018.78},{"due_date":"2016-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":3107},{"due_date":"2016-03-11T08:00:00Z","amount":3197.8},{"due_date":"2016-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":3291.26},{"due_date":"2016-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":3387.45},{"due_date":"2016-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":3486.44},{"due_date":"2016-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":3588.34},{"due_date":"2016-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":3693.2},{"due_date":"2016-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":3801.14},{"due_date":"2016-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":3912.23},{"due_date":"2016-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":4026.56},{"due_date":"2016-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":4144.24},{"due_date":"2017-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":4265.35},{"due_date":"2017-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":4390.01},{"due_date":"2017-03-11T08:00:00Z","amount":4518.31},{"due_date":"2017-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":4650.35},{"due_date":"2017-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":4786.26},{"due_date":"2017-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":4926.14},{"due_date":"2017-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":5070.1},{"due_date":"2017-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":5218.28},{"due_date":"2017-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":5370.78},{"due_date":"2017-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":5527.74},{"due_date":"2017-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":5689.18}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.33},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.19},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.07},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.98},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.91},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.88},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.87},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.88},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.93},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.01},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39.12},{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.27},{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.44},{"due_date":"2017-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.66},{"due_date":"2017-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.9},{"due_date":"2017-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.18},{"due_date":"2017-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.5},{"due_date":"2017-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.86},{"due_date":"2017-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.26},{"due_date":"2017-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.7},{"due_date":"2017-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.18},{"due_date":"2017-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.71},{"due_date":"2017-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.28},{"due_date":"2018-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.89}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":992960,"name":"Salama","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Salama is 25 years, she sells fire wood at Kilifi Kenya.

With your support she will be able to continue to grow her business. <\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\nEva  inici\u00f3 el negocio  ya que tenia  la necesidad de ayudar a su esposo con los gastos de la casa ya que a el le pagaban cada 15 dias y por los ni\u00f1os necesitaba dinero antes y no tenian por lo que vieron la posibilidad de abrir un  negocio ya que a este puede generar ganancias diario y asi poder cubrir los gastos que iban saliendo todos los dias.\r\nComenz\u00f3 con la tienda de abarraotes hace   5 a\u00f1os  le ha funcionado, desde aquel entonces adapto la entrada de su casa con techo de lamina y alli  instalo la tienda,  despues poco a poco fue surtiendo mas al negocio y ahora ya  le puse el techo de concreto para mayor comodidad y seguridad.\r\n<p>\r\nSin embargo, ella necesita un prestamo por US $500 que pagara en 6  meses par suritr de mercancia la tiendita ya que se le acabo y casi no tiene nada, ademas de que necesita surtir con mercancia de temporada porque la gente compra mucho refresco, hielo y cosas para mitigar el calor.

For her, living with them is a blessing.  Her ability to make friends quickly has helped her to use her free time to do productive activities like set up a phone call service in her town, a business that she has been developing for 2 years with some friends.  The difficult part of this work is the risk of muggings, as she has a number of cell phones due to the volume of customers who request her services.

Lucena is presently engaged in seaweed (\"guso\") production and culture and fishing. She also receives support from her husband, who is a fisherman. Lucena has been engaged in this business for 20 years and earns approximately 15,000 PHP for every harvest from their guso production and culture.\r\n\r\nIn September 2009, Lucena joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Lucena, as an active member under the PDP-LP, a microfinance program of PMPC, has successfully repaid a previous loan of 8,000 PHP from PMPC. She is now requesting a loan of 7,000 PHP which will be used to add capital for her seaweed \"guso\" culture and production and fishing activities. This will be the 3rd loan taken out by Lucena from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve her general living conditions, save for future use especially for loan repayments, basic needs, guso culture and production expansion and for possible house repairs.\r\n \r\n About PMPC:\r\n Paglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao.

 She is married and has 3 children, all of whom are in school.  Rehema has operated a business selling food (matooke) for less than one year. Matooke is a meal consisting of steamed green banana and is one of the national dishes of Uganda. To help expand her business, Rehema is requesting a loan of 150,000 UGX from BRAC Uganda, which she will use to buy more matooke. Rehema hopes that the loan will help her by allowing her to expand in her business. In the future, Rehema hopes to see her children study up to university.\r\n\r\nNote to lenders:\r\nBRAC Uganda has recently begun posting a new loan product to Kiva that funds young entrepreneurs in BRAC\u2019s Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. This Kiva borrower is receiving a new ELA loan.\r\n\r\nThe ELA program first provides disadvantaged adolescents, usually girls who are out of school, with livelihood training and financial literacy skills. Afterward, ELA participants can receive microfinance loans to expand their small businesses. These loans offer adolescents a unique chance to access finance at a young age and improve their prospects for the future, and target a segment of the population not typically served by traditional microfinance.\r\n\r\nKiva is privileged to partner with BRAC Uganda in posting these new loans, and give Kiva lenders the opportunity to fund deserving young entrepreneurs and support a promising new sector in microfinance.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":75,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":75,"image":{"id":573819,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

He lives alone. He has 7 years of experience working with mobile phones. He began as an employee in a mobile shop and opened his own store in 2003. With his loan requested of US $1200 from Kiva partner Ameen s.a.l., he will be able to increase his merchandise selection of new mobile phones and purchase prepaid telephone cards to sell. The majority of mobile phone users in Lebanon purchase these prepaid cards; it is less common to have an annual phone contract as is common in many Western countries. He reports that both his income and business productivity will be increased as a result of the loan. In the future, he is looking to further expand his business and increase his capital. \r\n\r\nNote: Based on the political and social challenges of Lebanon, personally identifiable attributes of this entrepreneur have been altered to protect him or her (i.e., blacking out portions of the entrepreneur in his\/her picture, not indicating his\/her name and location, etc.) Ameen s.a.l. appreciates Kiva lenders' understanding of these challenges and encourages lenders to continue their support for Lebanon's borrowers.\r\n\r\nAbout Ameen:\r\nAmeen s.a.l. has been a major player in the Lebanese Microfinance sector since 1999. Originally, a micro-credit program created by CHF International, Ameen evolved to become Ameen s.a.l. in 2003, a Lebanese services company.

She has been in this line of work for 21 years, and earns about 20,000 PHP a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2004, Harlen joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her life and ability to engage in business. She has successfully repaid 10 previous loans from PMPC and has applied for a new one, for 50,000 PHP, to buy additional items to sell to her customers. She plans to use the additional income made possible by this loan to put money aside for future emergencies. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She is a good, friendly, and hardworking woman, separated from her partner of many years with whom she had three daughters. Only one of her daughters is still a minor and depending on Rocio for her education and care. They live in her house and work together every day to be able to have a better quality of life.\r\n\r\nRocio's works selling candy and other products, which are exhibited on a small table in front of a busy park in her city. Her business is very popular with children, as she always has delicious things to sell, and also because she has a lot of patience for serving children. She almost always sells out of her merchandise. In addition to candy, Rocio prepares things like sweet and salty popcorn, and she brings fruit and other products that people always want to eat. She does this because what she has learned during this time is that one should always have a lot of variety to offer to customers.\r\n\r\nWhat Rocio likes most about her work is that it allows her to decide her own schedule. She has been doing this for two years, and she thinks the most difficult part is to stay in one place all day without moving. She hopes that in time she will be able to put together the necessary money to put in a general store. \r\n\r\nThis will be her sixth loan with MFP, and she is looking forward to the collaboration that will help her continue working toward her goals. She is also determined to make her payments on time, as she did with her past loans. In addition, Rocio is grateful for being part of the communal bank, because all of its members are very responsible and supportive. With the requested amount of 600 soles (~230 USD), she will buy more candy and fruit to continue offering a variety of products to her clients.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":953714,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy candy and fruit.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-12-22T14:40:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":225,"lender_count":6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rocio ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-11-21T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":600,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":90.59},{"due_date":"2012-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":95.59},{"due_date":"2012-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":95.23},{"due_date":"2012-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":102.71},{"due_date":"2012-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":106.54},{"due_date":"2012-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":109.34}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.97},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.85},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.71},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.52},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.95},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":33.97,"local_amount":90.59,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:49:49Z","rounded_local_amount":91.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250836360},{"amount":35.85,"local_amount":95.59,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:18:12Z","rounded_local_amount":96.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257246142},{"amount":35.71,"local_amount":95.23,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:31:49Z","rounded_local_amount":96.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263386158},{"amount":38.52,"local_amount":102.71,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:29:20Z","rounded_local_amount":103.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270099252},{"amount":39.95,"local_amount":106.54,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-18T08:29:43Z","rounded_local_amount":107.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276713399},{"amount":41,"local_amount":109.34,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:28:07Z","rounded_local_amount":110.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283202288}],"funded_date":"2011-12-24T14:23:09Z","paid_date":"2012-06-15T18:28:07Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Mairead Harris","image":500788}},{"id":377544,"name":"Ranan","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ranan is 36 years old and married.

Together, they've devoted their efforts and continued commitment to their agricultural work in order to give a proper education to their children who brought joy to their lives each day. But sadly, even with all their hard work and good intentions, they suffered a great tragedy when their eldest daughter suffered a serious accident in which she lost her life. This brought great anguish and sorrow to their home, but despite having great pain and sadness in their hearts, Rita collected all her strength and  took over the care of their small grandchildren (3 and 7 years old), which were orphaned when their mother died, and because their father didn't want to take responsibility of them.  Despite all the sadness (over their daughter's death), joy filled them when she and her husband took over the paternity of her grandchildren and began to work hard for them.  As a consequence of this situation,  Rita intends to upgrade their products and expand the cultivation of their land.  This is why she is applying for a loan (to buy fertilizers) in order to improve their crops, which will help them in creating a pleasant life for her grandchildren.  With your help Rita can provide a life suited to their grandchildren and provide them with a promising future.<p><b>Translated from Spanish by Mayra Gould, Kiva volunteer.<p><\/b>\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\nRita, se ha dedicado  con mucho esfuerzo al cultivo de mangos  y cacao;  gracias al apoyo de su pareja con el que contrajo matrimonio a\u00f1os atr\u00e1s, dedic\u00f3 por completo  sus esfuerzos y empe\u00f1o constante a su labor  agr\u00edcola a fin de brindarle una adecuada educaci\u00f3n a sus peque\u00f1os ni\u00f1os que alegraban su d\u00eda a d\u00eda su humilde morada.Sin embargo cuando todo esfuerzo y trabajo estaba concentrado hacia ese fin su hija mayor  sufri\u00f3 un grave accidente en el que  perdi\u00f3 la vida; este hecho  trajo gran congoja y tristeza en su hogar  y a pesar de tener gran dolor e inmensa tristeza dentro de su coraz\u00f3n,  se arm\u00f3 de valor para  hacerse cargo de sus peque\u00f1os nietecitos  de 3 y 7 a\u00f1itos, los cuales quedaron hu\u00e9rfanos  porque su padre  nunca  quiso  hacerse responsable de ellos.Motivo  por la cual ella  y su esposo  asumieron la paternidad de sus nietos y por  ellos trabajan arduamente y muy contentos para tambi\u00e9n otorgarles felicidad y bienestar.Ha consecuencia de esta situaci\u00f3n Rita,  tiene pensado mejorar sus productos y extender el cultivo de sus terrenos y   solicita un pr\u00e9stamo  para acrecentar sus productos y comprar abonos a fin de mejorar sus cosechas, que le ayudar\u00e1n a tener una  vida placentera para ella y sus nietos.Con tu colaboraci\u00f3n Rita podr\u00e1  brindar una vida adecuada a sus nietos y brindarles un futuro prometedor"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":84701,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"For the purchase of seeds and fertilizers to benefit their harvest and quality of their products.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2007-11-16T00:25:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":225,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-11-30T01:42:05Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":600,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-12-29T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2008-01-29T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2008-02-29T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2008-03-29T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2008-04-29T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2008-05-29T07:00:00Z","amount":100}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":38,"local_amount":101.33,"processed_date":"2007-12-30T20:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-05-30T09:26:01Z","rounded_local_amount":113.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":109180},{"amount":38,"local_amount":101.33,"processed_date":"2008-01-30T10:15:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-05-30T09:26:01Z","rounded_local_amount":113.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":124658},{"amount":38,"local_amount":101.33,"processed_date":"2008-02-29T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-05-30T09:26:01Z","rounded_local_amount":113.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":145661},{"amount":38,"local_amount":101.33,"processed_date":"2008-03-30T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-05-30T09:26:01Z","rounded_local_amount":113.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":169511},{"amount":38,"local_amount":101.33,"processed_date":"2008-04-30T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-05-30T09:26:01Z","rounded_local_amount":113.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":196779},{"amount":35,"local_amount":93.33,"processed_date":"2008-05-30T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-05-30T09:26:01Z","rounded_local_amount":104.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":223561}],"funded_date":"2007-11-16T01:42:05Z","paid_date":"2008-05-30T09:08:48Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":28392,"name":"Israel","description":{"languages":["es"],"texts":{"es":"The client currently lives with his wife and two children.

Her business gives Rosa the opportunity to get to know other people, be independent, earn her own money, help her children pursue professional careers, and have a better quality of life. She started in August of 1992, first selling ceramics that she commissioned from a lady who crafts them. When she realized that business was good, she decided to work independently and her sales doubled. In addition to ceramics, she also began to sell beauty products, and later she added jewelry. Now she sells clothing, too. Rosa's previous loan with Kiva helped her a lot because she was able to resupply her business for the holiday season, when people spend more.\r\n\r\nRosa needs a loan of US$550, which she'll repay in 5 months.

This group came out of the association Badeya and is united by ties of kinship (sisters and cousins).  The group members work to earn an income by trading in peanut oil, rice, soap, n\u00e9r\u00e9 seeds, beauty products, condiments, and \"soumbala\", which is made from cooked n\u00e9r\u00e9 seeds. \r\n<p>\r\nTo satisfy their ever-increasing customer base, they decided to join the Soro Yiriwaso micro-finance institution, with which they are on their fourth solidarity loan cycle (group loan).  All the preceding loans have been correctly repaid.\r\n<p>\r\nThe women of the group are requesting this loan to buy:  2 barrels of peanut oil, 13 sacks of rice, 5 sacks of n\u00e9r\u00e9 seeds, and a sizable quantity of condiments (2 sacks of onions, 2 of eggplant, 1 of okra, 5 packets of flavorings, and 5 cans of tomato paste).  The cities of Bobo Dioulasso and Bamako (respectively in Burkina Faso and Mali) are the main sources of supplies possible for the women. \r\n<p>\r\nThe goods are taken to Sikasso on market days to be sold in cash at wholesale and retail levels, both.  Their customers are generally composed of women and especially market vendors.  Sales are made either at the local marketplace or out of homes, cash or credit accepted.\r\n<p>\r\nUsing this fourth loan, the women each envision realizing an average profit of 50,000 francs CFA that will be used to pay the loan interest, to provide for the family, and to invest the rest into their respective businesses. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1950,"image":{"id":233526,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"To buy conditments, peanut oil, rice, soap, n\u00e9r\u00e9 seeds, beauty products","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sikasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.316667 -5.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2009-01-01T08:00:24Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1950,"lender_count":61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lala            ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alima         ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mariam       ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dj\u00e9n\u00e8bou    ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Aby            ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatoumata   ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ass\u00e9tou      ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maratou      ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-11-14T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":1000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1950,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":166666.67},{"due_date":"2009-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":166666.67},{"due_date":"2009-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":166666.67},{"due_date":"2009-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":166666.67},{"due_date":"2009-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":166666.67},{"due_date":"2009-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":166666.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":325},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":325},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":325},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":325},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":325},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":325}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":650,"local_amount":333333.34,"processed_date":"2009-01-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:27:21Z","rounded_local_amount":335407.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14889519},{"amount":325,"local_amount":166666.67,"processed_date":"2009-02-11T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:12:49Z","rounded_local_amount":167703.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20440302},{"amount":325,"local_amount":166666.67,"processed_date":"2009-03-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T22:08:54Z","rounded_local_amount":167703.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27135675},{"amount":325,"local_amount":166666.67,"processed_date":"2009-04-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:29:39Z","rounded_local_amount":167703.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36033476},{"amount":325,"local_amount":166666.65,"processed_date":"2009-05-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:39:58Z","rounded_local_amount":167703.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44620843}],"funded_date":"2009-01-03T16:54:59Z","paid_date":"2009-06-16T02:39:58Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Daniel Kuey","image":669418}},{"id":81663,"name":"Rosila","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rosila J. is a member in good standing of Mahayahay Center in Usocan, Plaridel, Misamis Occidental.

Her husband is an entrepreneur and Khaitgul started her business in 2002 in order to help support her family. All year she sells fruit and vegetables that she buys from local farmers. Twice a week, Khaitgul travels over 60 km to sell her produce at attractive prices at a busy market. With the loan of 3000 Somoni from Kiva, she plans to increase the range of her goods, and to buy apples, pomegranates, oranges, tomatoes, and cucumbers.<P>\r\n\r\nKhaitgul strives to give her children a better life than they have, including seeing them through a high level of education. With her business, she has been able to supply the community with fresh vegetables and also provide for her family. Khaitgul is a well-spoken, friendly businesswoman who is worthy of the support of Kiva lenders.   <P>\r\n \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International<P>\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and with it\u2019s famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

W. is a 65-year-old father of eight. He has been with GHAPE since 1999, and has been able to take out nine separate loans to be able to support his pig and fowl raising activities. For the first time, T. is looking to start another business as a motorcycle taxi driver, a rather profitable business in the area.\r\n\r\nT. will use this motorcycle to take community members throughout the area to and from their homes and places of business, and will also aid in taking their produce to market. This activity is sure to succeed, T. thinks, because he will be the driver of this bike himself, rather than paying other people to take care of the machine and drive people around. With this being the case, he will be riding the bike more carefully than other people, working harder, while also being able to cut down on the maintenance needs of the bike. \r\n\r\nAs he generates profits from this activity, T. will be using the money to invest in the education of his children, and also to improve on his family's living conditions. \r\n\r\nOriginally coming to GHAPE, T. saw that they were one of the best options for providing credit in the area, as they have lower interest rates, more agreeable terms on their loans, and a payment plan that is not very stressful. In addition to this, T. has been able to enjoy GHAPE training on how to manage his business, his money, and also on how to operate in his family life and day to day dealings with other people.\r\n\r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon. GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach. Every client is trained in business management, basic health, life skills, financial management, profits and losses, and family values.  Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement. GHAPE instills a sense of family and community within its clients and staff and has developed a strong bond of trust between the organization and its clients.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":363332,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Motorcycle

She has two grown children and has worked as a cook for the Nicaraguan Army since she was 8 years old. Because of her low income she has not been able to receive a loan for more than 10,000 C\u00f3rdobas. She has used her previous loans to improve her home little by little. With her last loan she plastered her walls and tiled her living room. With this loan she will finish plastering the outdoor walls because it required more cement and sand and she was unable to complete the job with her last loan. She is satisfied because soon her house will be more solid and look better. Many thanks to the loans that Afodenic has provided.

They have sheep.\r\n\r\nArtemia likes doing both activities because they are peaceful and profitable.  Even though she lost part of her harvest in previous years, the years and the experience have given her the necessary tools to learn the techniques to produce quantity and quality.\r\n\r\nThis is the sixth time she has had a loan with MFP.  She is very satisfied with what she has achieved so far.  That is why she promises, one more time, to make each one of her payments.  She will use the money she is asking for to buy compost, fertilizers, and insecticides, which will help her improve and prepare her land for the next harvest.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":453346,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Buy fertilizer and insecticide","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-12-21T15:20:16Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":525,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Artemia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-11-26T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":525}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":525,"local_amount":1500,"processed_date":"2010-07-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:36:36Z","rounded_local_amount":1512,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159672751}],"funded_date":"2009-12-21T16:54:15Z","paid_date":"2010-08-15T11:36:36Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ginny Kalish"}},{"id":167970,"name":"Roeung's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This village bank loan consists of 13 people, all of whom live in Preaek Khmer village in Kandal province.

Peter has been selling crude liquor for the last 5 years as a means of earning his livelihood.  It goes without saying that this beverage is in high favour with many rank and file folks around his neighborhood.  For this reason, Peter has been able to make ends meet though not as effectively as he would want.  The reason for this he says is because unlike other beverages like beers which are taken by middle and high income earners, crude alcohol is mostly consumed by low income earners with paltry cash. \r\n\r\nThis business, Peter reveals, was begun with savings from his produce sales business, which is still a business for him, though he has less time for it at the present time.  When he is not there to see the day to day running of business, his wife with whom he has 5 kids is always there to run it.  Monthly, this business generates him 200,000 shillings.

She, together with her husband and children, manages their own household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nGirlie operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a Php5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg.  She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Aside from this she also retails rice & electronic cell phone loading. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 550 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php 19,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nGirlie hopes her business grows into a mini-grocery and dreams to be able to give her children a good and high quality education through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay Micro Finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":880832,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy grocery items and other products for sale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"GMA, Cavite","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2011-09-30T18:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":450,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Girlie","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":19000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":791.67},{"due_date":"2011-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":791.67},{"due_date":"2011-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":791.67},{"due_date":"2011-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":791.67},{"due_date":"2011-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":791.67},{"due_date":"2011-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":791.67},{"due_date":"2011-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":791.67},{"due_date":"2011-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":791.67},{"due_date":"2011-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":791.67},{"due_date":"2011-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":791.67},{"due_date":"2011-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":791.67},{"due_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":791.67},{"due_date":"2011-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":791.67},{"due_date":"2011-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":791.67},{"due_date":"2011-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":791.67},{"due_date":"2011-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":791.67},{"due_date":"2012-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":791.67},{"due_date":"2012-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":791.67},{"due_date":"2012-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":791.67},{"due_date":"2012-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":791.67},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":791.67},{"due_date":"2012-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":791.67},{"due_date":"2012-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":791.67},{"due_date":"2012-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":791.59}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":150,"local_amount":6333,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T09:37:39Z","rounded_local_amount":6553.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238571817},{"amount":75,"local_amount":3167.04,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:31:44Z","rounded_local_amount":3277.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244529367},{"amount":75,"local_amount":3166.96,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T09:39:25Z","rounded_local_amount":3277.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250738584},{"amount":75,"local_amount":3166,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T09:48:46Z","rounded_local_amount":3276.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257145824},{"amount":75,"local_amount":3167,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:01:32Z","rounded_local_amount":3277.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263274827}],"funded_date":"2011-10-03T14:49:57Z","paid_date":"2012-03-15T09:01:32Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kent Chao","image":988875}},{"id":344769,"name":"Evelyn","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"As a married mother of six children, Evelyn works hard to support her family.

Thi Thuoc, 54 years old, joined the TYM Fund in 1999. Before that, her family's income came mainly from farming. Therefore, she used the first loan to invest in raising livestock. However, the income from that project did not bring about a significant increase in income. As she is skillful and sensitive in doing business, she discussed with her husband and decided to borrow and invest in growing decorative plants. Together with raising livestock and farming, this project has brought about increasing income. Currently, she has many decorative plants with high values. This time round, she would like to borrow 9,000,000VND (550USD) to grow more decorative plants to sell in the coming Lunar New Year. Her family's monthly income is 4,000,000VND (about 250USD)\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Vietnamese by Pham Yen Thanh, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\nCh\u1ecb Nguy\u1ec5n Th\u1ecb Th\u01b0\u1ee3c n\u0103m nay 54 tu\u1ed5i.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <p>\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <p>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<p>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from planting and harvesting  a variety of vegetables for sale.  Fialogo has been engaged in this business for over 5 years and earns approximately 300 WST a month from these activities.<P>\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Fialogo joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve  her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Fialogo has successfully repaid a previous loan of 750 WST from SPBD.  This previous loan was used to purchase harvesting equipment.  Fialogo is now requesting a new loan of 1000 WST which will be used to purchase additional seeds, seedlings and young crops to raise.

She\u2019s married and has three children: Roberto Carlos, 21, who is married and works, Marco Antonio, who is 16 and works, and Bryan, who is ten and goes to elementary school.\r\n\r\nHer business is selling chicken.  She is asking for funds to buy chicken.  She started the business 7 years ago due to need because her husband\u2019s earnings didn\u2019t go far enough.  The locale where she sells is located downtown and she rents it; the rent se pays to the helper is low.  When she started her business she\u2019d get the chicken in the morning and she\u2019d have to pay for it in the afternoon.  Her business is in downtown Ahuehueyo, two blocks from home.  She walks to work.\r\n\r\nHer business is very important to her because that\u2019s what provides for her family.  Her favorite part of the business is when sales happen because then she has money and that gives her much satisfaction and pride for being able to get ahead, when she is able to buy the things her children ask for.\r\n\r\nHer customers are her friends, neighbors, housewives and domestics.  The products she offers her customers are whole chickens and chicken parts, chicken filets.  Her business is popular thanks to the good customer service she provides; when the customers come by she already has their orders ready for them to pick up and when they have parties they order the chicken from her.\r\n\r\nHer business faces competition from chicken shops nearby.  She uses the profits for her children.  She\u2019d like to have a place to keep live chickens and earn better profits; she expects to accomplish this through hard work.\r\n\r\nHer business has helped her economically to meet her children\u2019s educational expenses so that they can continue in school.  Her plans and hopes are to see her business grow and increase sales.\r\n\r\nShe is happy with this loan she got because it will provide her with the opportunity to acquire her chicken and provide better customer service.\r\n\r\nThe improvements she hopes for the future are that her children stay in school so that they will prepare themselves to be people of importance some day and she aims to accomplish this with help from the loan she\u2019ll use for her business.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":684222,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":" To buy live chickens and at wholesale to sell whole or in pieces.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"SAN JUAN AHUEHUEYO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2011-01-03T20:40:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":750,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Adriana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-12-15T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":9000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-29T08:00:00Z","amount":900},{"due_date":"2011-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":900},{"due_date":"2011-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":900},{"due_date":"2011-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":900},{"due_date":"2011-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":900},{"due_date":"2011-03-09T08:00:00Z","amount":900},{"due_date":"2011-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":900},{"due_date":"2011-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":900},{"due_date":"2011-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":900},{"due_date":"2011-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":900}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":225,"local_amount":2700,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T03:44:54Z","rounded_local_amount":2783.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191430796},{"amount":150,"local_amount":1800,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:44:41Z","rounded_local_amount":1855.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195850054},{"amount":150,"local_amount":1800,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:10:01Z","rounded_local_amount":1855.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201292327},{"amount":150,"local_amount":1800,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:09:34Z","rounded_local_amount":1855.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206160592},{"amount":75,"local_amount":900,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:22:45Z","rounded_local_amount":927.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211233493}],"funded_date":"2011-01-09T20:19:37Z","paid_date":"2011-06-15T11:22:45Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":266900,"name":"Edwin Bladimir","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El Se\u00f1or Edwin Bladimir S.

He is a very hardworking man, as he has always liked working hard in order to improve his family\u2019s lives.  For this reason he began to sell snacks and natural drinks, until his clients ask him for more products and he decided to begin this business.  And so he began with this humble business.

Jella is requesting a new loan of 11000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional working capital for making peanut butter, as well as two piglets. This loan will be the 3rd loan taken out by Jella from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement income of the family and purchase additional feed for her pigs. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines.

She has worked for 24 years selling dairy products and cheese in Chixoles, the village where she lives.  Her husband delivers the products on his bicycle.  They also work selling livestock.  She is known by her customers and identifies with them as she is a kind person.  She begins work very early to arrive on time to distribute her products.  She thanks God that she is already well-known and her clientele keeps increasing.

Aside from that, the fields provide a tranquility that he needs because this work is exhausting and requires a lot of sacrifice.  In the future he wants to have more extensions to his land and buy more animals.\r\n\r\nThis will be his first loan through MFP and he\u2019s very happy to know that he has financial backing.  He is also glad to be part of a communal bank, because its members are very united and responsible.  He appreciates the people who manage this loan and it has been very helpful to the progress of his business.  He will use the money from this loan to buy sacs of fertilizer for his next planting.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Hugo Reyes, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":589772,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Fertilizer","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"HUANCAYO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.066667 -75.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:20Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":725,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Manuel ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-07-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":725}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":725,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:31:52Z","rounded_local_amount":2029.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206195500}],"funded_date":"2010-09-04T18:25:05Z","paid_date":"2011-05-15T11:31:52Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Hugo E.

He is in the business of growing and selling Irish potatoes. His weekly income is 30,000 Uganda shillings.\r\n\r\nIrish potatoes are fast becoming a favorite food in most households in Uganda, principally due to the fact that there are inexpensive and easy to cook. Restaurants provide a good market for Irish potatoes and Ventura mostly sells to entrepreneurs owning these businesses.\r\n\r\nVentura is requesting a loan, which he will use to  purchase germinating Irish potato seeds to plant.

farming business after she got married to I Gusti Putu Tinda . Up to now she is active in the business, since with pig farming, this family of 5 could fulfill daily needs. Her husband's income as a tenant farmer is not sufficient to cover schooling expenses for her 3 children:  Agung Ayu Damayanti, Agung Lanang Putra dan Ayu Cempaka Dewi. However wih her additional efforts of pig farming, her children are now in Highschool, Middle school, and Grade school. Before Dinari's loan she only has a capital of Rp300,000 (about US$33) to buy 2 local piglets, that she raised the traditional way, by feeding them banana tree trunk, and talas leaves which grows around her home.  With that limited capital she often has to sell her pigs before harvest, because of urgent family needs or to buy food for the family. With additional loan of Rp1,500,000 (about $165), Agung could buy 3 more piglets, and the rest to buy few sacks of wheat and rice shell clippings to feed her animals. Hence the growth would be enhanced, and income would increase to Rp3,000,000 ($330) per 6 months.\r\n<p><b>Translated from Bahasa Indonesia by Gwan Liong Ang, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\nDengan kandang yang sangat sederhana , dinding bambu dan atap daun kelapa yang di anyam.

Sampai saat ini Agung masih tetap menekuni usaha itu karena dengan beternak babi keluarga yang beranggotakan 5 orang ini dapat memenuhi kebutuhan hidup sehari hari . Hasil suami yang hanya sebagai buruh tani tidak cukup untuk membiayai pendidikan tiga orang anaknya Yakni : Agung Ayu Damayanti, Agung Lanang Putra dan Ayu Cempaka Dewi. Namun berkat ketekunan Agung dalam memelihara babi, kini anak-anaknya telah duduk di bangku sekolah SMA, SMP dan SD .Sebelum mendapat pinjaman dari Dinari,  Agung hanya mengandalkan modal Rp 300.000.- untuk membeli 2 ekor bibit babi lokal yang di pelihara secara tradisional yaitu dengan makanan batang pisang dan daun talas yang tumbuh di sekitar rumahnya . Dengan modal yang sangat terbatas itu sering  kali Agung harus menjual ternaknya sebelum waktu panen karena kebutuhan keluarga yang mendesak atau tak sanggup membeli pakan. \r\n       Kini  Agung telah mendapatkan tambahan modal dari Dinari sebesar Rp 1.500.000.- Dengan  tambahan modal itu   Agung mulai membeli bibit baru lagi sebanyak 3 ekor dan sisanya di belikan beberapa sak dedak gandum

This is 47 year old Hasadia J S.. She is married woman with five children between the ages of 14 and 26. She has owned a vitenge and tailoring business since 2007.\r\n\r\nKitenge (the Swahili plural is vitenge) is a cotton fabric with wax print, printed by using rotary printing machines. Kitenge is a communicating textile - the various colors, patterns, writings and symbols represent moods, feelings, cultures, and traditions of native African people. Women use these colorful and boldly printed fabrics to make traditional Tanzania outfits which usually consist of long fitted skirts and conservative boat necked tops.  As such, Hasadia is a smart entrepreneur and does not simply sell vitenge, but also offers her services as a seamstress.  Thus, customers can select the cloth and the style of outfit they would like as well as have their measurements taken. It\u2019s really a one stop shop for women!\r\n\r\nCurrently her business is able to generate a monthly profit of about USD200 and she is requestring a loan in order to  purchase additional vitenge. In future she hopes to further increase the quantity and range of the stock. She thanks you for your support in advance!\r\n\r\nABOUT SELFINA:\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":248284,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing

(United Dangerous Women). She began with Kiva partner, Esperanza, because she needed to for her business. She now loves the program and her loan partners. Her story is representative of her group and of Esperanza's Haitian and Dominican clients generally (many of whom recently emigrated to the Dominican Republic from Haiti). Her group is located in the rural area surrounding El Seibo, an agricultural area. This area, like nearly all impoverished areas of the Dominican Republic, suffers from unreliable running water (none of which is potable) and electricity. Susana makes her home here in a simple structure with her long-term partner and one child. \r\n<br>Susana is excited to be taking her ninth loan with Esperanza after having successfully repaid her previous loan and grown her business. She has run her business for almost seven years, and started out by selling small amounts of fruits from a bag as she walked along the street. She plans to use this loan to invest in her fruit stand by buying papaya, watermelon, mangoes, salad and other items such as cosmetics and clothes. She will use the profits to buy a television and school supplies. Susana wants to improve her business so that she can save to build her house.
