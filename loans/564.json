It has produced famous thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. A civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged an already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural productivity and the manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b><br>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent viable business prospects. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from planting & harvesting bananas for sale.  Lotovale has been engaged in this business for over 6 years and earns approximately 500 WST a month from these activities.\n\nIn 2008, Lotovale joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve  her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Lotovale has successfully repaid a previous loan of 750 WST from SPBD.  This previous loan was used to purchase fertilizers such as manure.  Lotovale is now requesting a new loan of 1500 WST which will be used to purchase additional seeds, seedlings & young crops to raise.  The loan will be the 2nd loan taken out by the borrower from SPBD.  Lotovale plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business  to financially support immediate members of the borrower's family.\n\nAbout SPBD:\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.\n\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Fanta is not educated, because before the late 1970\u2019s her tribe, the Mandingo, believed that women did not need to be educated, but rather should rely on their husbands for their daily needs and financial matters. \r\n\r\nTo deal with her lack of formal education, she learned tailoring and today both lives and works on McDonald Street in downtown Monrovia, Liberia. She buys clothes wholesale and sells them retail. She also sells jewellery. Her business has been doing well.\r\n\r\nFatu started as a contractor but later opened her own shop. Sometimes, she faces difficulties and challenges because she has so many customers that she has a hard time taking care of all of them. Fatu believes that by buying the right goods and preparing them carefully for sale, she can retain her customers because everyone wants nice clothing.  \r\n\r\nFatu has been in business for more than 10 years but still wants to grow so she can own a big business and improve her skills. She would also like to build a house for her child.  She has applied for this loan to buy more clothes and better serve her customers.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":392441,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing

In addition, she takes care of one dependent from another family who is 16 years old.  Annonciatha lives in Nyarugenge, a region of Kigali, the capital city of Rwanda.  Here, Annonciatha is the president of a group called Tuzamurane.  This is the group's third successful year in the business of selling foodstuffs such as beans, potatoes, fish, soft drinks and produce.  The hours of their business require that they work from early in the morning until late in the evening depending upon customer traffic on any given day.\r\n\r\nThe members of this group seek to improve their businesses and to increase their sales using the capital from this loan.  This is their first loan from Kiva lenders via Vision Finance Company. With this loan, these members plan to carefully source and then purchase a greater quantity and variety of goods to sell.

He offers a door-to-door transportation service.  He went to the United States to work and to have more economic opportunities, but as his children were growing up without the guidance of their father, he decided to return to Ecuador and work as a chauffeur.  Little by little, and with effort, he continued his work as a chauffeur even though he was separated from his wife and was dedicating even more time to his children.  He hasn't had the money he needs to build a home.  This is why he will use this loan to buy cement, bricks, and cables.

She owns a business venture planting, harvesting and selling fruits & vegetables.  She has 3 years of experience in this business.  \r\n\r\nIn 2008, Mouena joined SPBD.  SPBD's loans are Mouena's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.  She has had 2 previous loans with this organization, and is asking for a new loan of WST 2,000 to purchase additional seeds, seedlings & young crops to raise.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 250 talas or US $104 per week) to improve and expand her business.\r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD:\r\n\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD, and since then it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii as well as Tonga.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.

She is married to Lino P., a carpenter, and the mother of seven children, one of whom is in college and three of whom are enrolled in high school. The remaining three children stay at home, helping with the chores and running the household while Evangeline and her husband work.\n\nEvangeline operates a rug-making business and does sideline work as a laundry woman. She primarily sells doormats but she also sells rugs, towels, braided quilts, bed sheets, and other crafts. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of PHP 300 in sales every day.  \n\nTo help her continue operating her business, she is requesting a PHP 12,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy additional raw materials, such as fabric, thread, and newspapers for patterns. She expects a boost in her income as she expands her business.

He lives with Cecilia, 22, and they have 2 children:  Sarai, who is 5, and Tany, who is 2.  The 4 of them live in their own house located in a rural area of Santa Clara.  Their future plans are to acquire their own agricultural land.  Eduardo has been working diligently for 5 years on rented land where he grows potatoes, peas, beans, and other vegetables.  After each harvest, he sells them at the central market in the city of Tarma.  Every harvest is a product of his effort.  He makes good profits, and he is thankful to his communal bank for their support.  He is saving money every day, and he now lacks very little to be able to buy his own land.  With it, he predicts that he will have more profits and will be able to buy much more.  He also has 4 dairy cows that produce enough milk to make molds of cheese that he sells at a market on Thursdays and Sundays.  He also has 2 strong, big bulls that help him plow the land where he grows his main native crops of the area.\r\n\r\nHe belongs to the communal bank, \"Trabajemos unidos\" (We Work United), and this is his seventh loan with Microfinanzas Prisma.  He is thankful for the lessons offered by the members of this group, which motivated him to get ahead and think about the future.  This is what motivated him to be the president of his little bank.  Eduardo began his potato crop with the variety, \"primeriza,\" which requires a lot of care.  With the money requested, he will buy various bags of organic fertilizer (such as bird manure) to ensure a good production."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":761958,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To purchase organic fertilizer","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-05-01T02:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1075,"lender_count":39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Eduardo ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-04-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":1075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":3000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1075}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":1075,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:17:58Z","rounded_local_amount":3032.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257245156}],"funded_date":"2011-05-02T16:10:11Z","paid_date":"2012-02-15T11:17:58Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tanya Harper","image":783083}},{"id":299346,"name":"Maria","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Mar\u00eda es socia del Banco Comunal \u201cChijuyo Copapujo\u201d ubicado en el distrito D.

Aujourd\u2019hui, il cherche \u00e0 donner une grande dimension \u00e0 son activit\u00e9 et a l\u2019ambition de pr\u00e9parer une grande exposition qui lui permettra de s\u2019ouvrir davantage sur l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur car les tableaux sont plus appr\u00e9ci\u00e9s en Europe et aux Etats-Unis. Cet important projet qui m\u00e9rite d\u2019\u00eatre soutenu, demande assez de moyens dont ne dispose pas M. A.. Il faut noter que M. A. a d\u00e9j\u00e0 des exp\u00e9riences en mati\u00e8re  de gestion des cr\u00e9dits car il avait b\u00e9n\u00e9fici\u00e9 par le pass\u00e9 de deux cr\u00e9dits respectifs de $300 et $650 qu\u2019il avait su bien g\u00e9rer et rembourser sans incident. Il m\u00e9rite tout confiance d\u2019\u00eatre financi\u00e8rement soutenu.\r\nIl sollicite aujourd\u2019hui un cr\u00e9dit de $1500 qui servira \u00e0 louer \u00e0 am\u00e9nager un local pour ouvrir sa boutique et \u00e0 acheter des mat\u00e9riels de travail n\u00e9cessaires pour ses prestations et productions. La r\u00e9alisation de ce projet le rendra encore plus c\u00e9l\u00e8bre et lui permettra de disposer d\u2019un revenu s\u00fbr pour la satisfaction des besoins de sa famille.

Houssein owns a bakery. He does \u201csaj,\u201d \u201cmankoucheh,\u201d and \u201cknefeh.\" The \u201csaj\u201d is the metal oven where you do the saj bread and the saj bread is a traditional Lebanese cooking dome used to make Markouk (thinned) bread and doughy confections or mankoucheh. A mankoucheh looks like a folded pizza with the most common toppings being zaatar (thyme), jebneh (cheese) and lahm bi ajin (minced meat). You can eat it anytime of the day, but somehow it tastes better in the morning. Knefeh is a traditional breakfast Lebanese sweet; it is a special kind of braided cheese that is served with liquid sugar in rounded bread. It is also served as a dessert, but somehow it tastes better in the morning also. In America and in Europe, knefeh is known as a gourmet dish that will surpass in popularity the cheesecake and the pancake. Houssein requested a loan of $1000 USD from Al Majmoua in order to purchase a refrigerator for his sweets and the sodas and to purchase additional raw materials. This is the first time that Houssein has requested a loan.\r\n\r\nHoussein is known for his good mankoucheh and his knefeh. His clients can be anybody from his region.

As such, she also sells \"nopales\" (a prickly pear cactus stem) which she grows and cauliflower and broccoli to earn a living.

With the help of a Kiva loan, a furniture maker is able to increase the volume of their lumber purchases or hire additional labor.  This additional leverage allows an entrepreneur to increase productivity and profitability. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":898221,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Furniture Making","sector":"Manufacturing","themes":null,"use":"to buys wood and timbers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NP","country":"Nepal","town":"Thecho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"28 84","type":"point"}},"partner_id":62,"posted_date":"2011-10-24T15:50:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":275,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Bina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-10-03T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NPR","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2011-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2012-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2012-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2012-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2012-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2012-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2012-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2012-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2012-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2012-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2012-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.63}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.91},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.91},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.91},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.91},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.92}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":22.92,"local_amount":1667,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T11:05:53Z","rounded_local_amount":1797.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244647937},{"amount":22.91,"local_amount":1666,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T11:14:40Z","rounded_local_amount":1795.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250865069},{"amount":22.92,"local_amount":1667.01,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-30T07:55:09Z","rounded_local_amount":1797.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257275054},{"amount":22.92,"local_amount":1666.99,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-30T07:55:31Z","rounded_local_amount":1797.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263416520},{"amount":22.91,"local_amount":1666,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-25T08:04:19Z","rounded_local_amount":1795.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270131321},{"amount":68.68,"local_amount":4995,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-27T08:25:38Z","rounded_local_amount":5384.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276947121},{"amount":91.74,"local_amount":6672,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-26T08:09:56Z","rounded_local_amount":7192.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283296510}],"funded_date":"2011-10-24T17:11:19Z","paid_date":"2012-06-26T08:09:56Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":352668,"name":"Angela Rosa","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Palacaguina municipio de Estel\u00ed, en donde proviene do\u00f1a \u00c1ngela una amable y calidad se\u00f1ora de 41 a\u00f1os, quien se dedica a elaborar unos sabrosos frescos, es madre de dos hijos, casada.

She is an active, hardworking and happy person, who invests her positive energy and love into hand-sowing Kyrgyz national items.  Her beautiful and elegant products are in high demand among the local residents and become included in dowries for local brides.  The energetic Syrgaim is also involved in animal husbandry - fattening up and selling livestock.

He began learning the trade from another person 20 years ago. Upon his release from his work with that person he decided to frame a print of a painting and offer it for sale. He sold it to a friend. This moved him to open his own business. Using his savings, and a loan, he was able to rent a space where he began to buy printed works, mount them and then sell the framed paintings. His business grew to the point that he had as many as six people working for him, selling the frames that he created. Unfortunately, competition came to the area. He began manufacturing mirrors, which worked out well for him. Currently, he produces both products without any help, aside from his son who now paints frames. He works seven days a week from 8:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. His shop is located in his home. \r\n<p> \r\nAbsalon would like to obtain a loan to invest in the production of mirrors which he has stopped making due to his lack of funds. \r\n<p> \r\nAbsalon is married. He is 40 years old and has 4 children, one of which has begun to assist him in the production of the painting frames. His wife works as a homemaker.

He is 50 years old, married and the father of 12 children between 7 and 28 years of age.  He went to school until 5th grade and didn't continue due to the distance between his home and the middle school. He lives in his own house with his family and supports his parents who live with him. \r\n\r\nHe left Inhambane to Namaacha looking for a job. After 12 years working as a guard he started a business selling pots. He managed to build two houses given that he has two wives and to buy a car to help him in his job. Currently, besides selling pots he also transports people in his area making 200.00 meticais per day. He also raises chickens and spends 50,000 meticais to raise 800 chicks. He has an income of 15,000 meticais which is applied towards household expenses. He saves around 2,000 to 3,000 meticais in his bank account. \r\n\r\nThis is Jequicene's third loan with Hluvuku and Kiva. It is for 22,000 meticais and will be used to purchase chicks, feed and vitamins to increase his flock. The two first loans (for 18,000 and 22,000 meticais) were used for the same goal. He is confident he will pay the loan back ahead of schedule and request another loan to build a shop to sell pots. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Betyna

The Mixtec language is spoken by all the people who inhabit this village where the magic of nature and their colorful traditional customs mix together in abundance. San Miguel Tetepelcingo is located 45 minutes to the southwest of the town of Pinotepa Nacional and is characterized by its handcrafted weaving. There are twelve persons who make up the group, most of them craftswomen, and their representative is Demetria Hern\u00e1ndez L.. \r\n\r\nOn this occasion we will speak with Gloria Hern\u00e1ndez Nicol\u00e1s. She is 31 years of age and married to Francisco, 32, a lifelong farmer who cultivates corn, beans, squash and chile. Gloria is mother to four children who are: Edith, 15, who is in middle school, and Ricardo, 12, Franciso, 10, and Juan Carlos, 9, all three of whom attend elementary school. Gloria is a craftswoman since the age of eleven. Her work is the making of tortilla cloths, tablecloths, pillow cases and handwoven clothing, all of it created using an age-old technique called \u201ctelar de cintura\u201d [waist weaving] which is called \u201csahcma-tavi\u201d in Mixtec. It is a highly original and demanding technique since the origin of the threads is maintained up through the creation of the finished article. The entire process is a legacy dating back to the very distant past. \r\n\r\nGloria requested her loan with Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad for the purchase of more material for making her textiles, as follows: cotton yarn for weaving, in white, blue, purple, red, yellow, green, orange, and brown. These colors are fundamental and characteristic of her work. She was also able to update certain tools such as frames and large pushers which are made by hand. She tells us that she does her handiwork at home and then distributes it in the areas surrounding Pinotepa and Jamiltepec. The journey is often quite difficult since during the rainy season there are road blockages or landslides. She says her mother taught her this profession and it is the only means by which the women in the area may feel useful. She still remembers that special moment when she made her first woven cloth and saw that the product of her hands has a use in the home, on a table since the napkins are for covering the corn tortillas. \r\n\r\nGloria\u2019s great dream is to promote her handicraft in national and international markets, as in this way, work would be guaranteed to all the producers in this village area. She would like to create a cooperative society in which their products are met with appreciation. She also aspires to raise production, sell more in order to invest, and increase the number of special orders. She would like to improve her living quarters and offer a better education to her children so that some day they may aspire to something more. \r\n\r\nMost of the group members are craftswomen and very dedicated to their profession. They are very responsible persons and when it comes to following through they always do. The women share the requisite trust and a spirit of mutual support. They help each other in everything and are very well-mannered. \r\n\r\nOn behalf of all those who make up this group, she thanks the foundation and those who in every way contribute to this project, a project which improves lives and stokes the dreams of the most vulnerable among us. She tells us \u201cThe essence of the human being is the ability to help others\u201d. \r\n\r\nThe names of the Tetepelcingo group members and their businesses are:\r\n\r\nEmilia Mariana Nicol\u00e1s. \u2013 Weaver \r\nReina R.

At this time, because it is the school season, her customers are requesting book bags, which is why it is essential for her to buy them so that she can fill those orders. Her aim is to expand her business and transform herself into a more prominent entrepreneur. This is her tenth loan with MFP, and she commits to making all of her repayments punctually, as she has been doing this whole time. Upon receiving this loan, she will purchase book bags to fill her customers' orders.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":742941,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to purchase book bags ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-03-31T23:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-03-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":149.36},{"due_date":"2011-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":154.79},{"due_date":"2011-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":163.05},{"due_date":"2011-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":170.39},{"due_date":"2011-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":177.51},{"due_date":"2011-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":184.9}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.01},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.05},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.14},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.9},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.56},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.34}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":56.01,"local_amount":149.36,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:32:44Z","rounded_local_amount":157.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206196469},{"amount":58.05,"local_amount":154.79,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:41:39Z","rounded_local_amount":163.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211270146},{"amount":61.14,"local_amount":163.05,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:32:37Z","rounded_local_amount":172,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216550165},{"amount":63.9,"local_amount":170.39,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T09:12:39Z","rounded_local_amount":179.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221718843},{"amount":135.9,"local_amount":362.41,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-17T08:13:23Z","rounded_local_amount":382.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227350305}],"funded_date":"2011-04-01T13:38:24Z","paid_date":"2011-09-17T08:13:23Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Elizabeth Casian","image":845142}},{"id":291182,"name":"Nenita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Nenita works hard to support her family.

For the past 14 years she has operated a grocery sales business. She currently sells a variety of sweets, sausages, oil, canned foods, drinks and other products in her grocery store. Lochinoy has requested a loan to give her additional working capital so she can purchase more inventory for her business.\n\nLochinoy is married and has 3 children. In addition to taking care of her family, she also helps care for her elderly parents.  Lochinoy has been an excellent client with IMON International, repaying all previous loans with no delays. IMON International is happy to have another opportunity to assist her in operating a successful business.  \n\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\n\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women and uses the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility.

Gradualmente reuni\u00f3 un capital,  producto de su esfuerzo,  perseverancia y disciplina, que le sirvi\u00f3 para afiliarse a una empresa y poder exhibir productos mediante gu\u00edas especializadas, construyendo as\u00ed su propia clientela, que la impuls\u00f3 a incursionar en la venta de otras mercanc\u00edas  solicitadas  que no encontraban en la revista para la cual trabajaba. \n\nCon el  incremento de sus ingresos empez\u00f3 a comprar por vol\u00famenes pero su mercanc\u00eda no estaba protegida, pues no tenia donde guardarlas y se le dificultaba el control de sus inventarios;esta forma de trabajar la manten\u00eda mucho tiempo fuera de su hogar, razones por las que se esforz\u00f3 para comprar vitrinas que protegieran sus productos y los exhibieran  en un sitio fijo, para ello pens\u00f3 en abrirle un espacio a este prop\u00f3sito en su vivienda, una Miscel\u00e1nea que todos en su barrio y en los alrededores ahora conocen.

The neighborhood is characterized by houses that were raised with great effort by its inhabitants.\n\nMyriam is a natural businesswoman.  She started her first business in 1998 when her husband was suddenly left without work.  She needed to figure out how to meet the family commitments, especially those related to her children\u2019s education and the general household expenses.  This situation led her to discover her business potential.  \n\nThat is how she came, for the first time, to sell beauty products that she got from a friend.  She could not do it directly because she did not have money to start, and she lacked a credit history because she was not known in the business.\n\nGradually, through her effort, perseverance, and discipline, she got together the capital to affiliate herself with a business.  She was able to display her products through special guides and build her own customer base.  This drove her to start selling other requested merchandise that could not be found in her business\u2019 magazine.\n\nWith the increase in earnings, she started to buy in bulk.  But, her merchandise was not protected, and she did not have a place to store it.  It was difficult to control her inventory.  This work kept her away from home a lot.  That is why she put forth much effort to buy display cases to protect her products and display them in a fixed place.  She thought of opening a place in her home.  It is a small general store, and everyone in the neighborhood and surrounding area knows it.  She has overcome many difficulties.  The most difficult happened when the business was more prosperous, and she was self-sufficient without the need of going into debt.  Her little granddaughter became ill, and part of her capital went towards her granddaughter\u2019s recuperation.  \n\nThat was when she turned to the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation, for the first time, to look for help.  Her new loan will help her to buy beauty products, hygiene products, decorations, underwear, items for the home, and merchandise like clothing for women and men that she still sells through catalogs.\n\nHer biggest dream is to separate the business from her family life in order to effectively balance her work life and her personal home life.  She plans to organize a place independent from her house and gradually buy new showcases for her merchandise.  To do this, Myriam, with her husband, will work by doubling her efforts.\n\n    \n \n\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva

ties of poverty. She is the mother of three children. As a mother with big dreams, in 2006, she joined ASHI (Ahon sa Hirap, Inc.), a micro-finance institution and KIVA partner in the Philippines. Since then, Andrea started selling rice and direct selling Avon products and this really helped to meet their needs. \n\nNow on her sixth loan, she proposes to use the loan amount of 28,000 pesos to purchase more inventory for her business. Specifically, the loan funds will be used to pay for 16 sacks of rice and to purchase Avon products. She hopes that, with the help of ASHI as a KIVA field partner, she can reach her ambition to step out from poverty, expand her business and pay for her three children's needs in school until they complete college degrees.\n\n\n\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":531906,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To

Y. is from the village of Colupan Bajo, Sinacaban, Misamis Occidental.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from raising pigs for sale. Juliet has been engaged in her business for over 3 years and earns approximately 1,750 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Juliet joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Juliet has successfully repaid a previous loan of 3,000 PHP from GDMPC. This previous loan was used as additional capital for her business. Juliet is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP which will be used to purchase feed. This loan will be the second loan taken out by Juliet from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three unit offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is 31 years old, single and the mother of a one year old baby. She finished high school and went on to conclude her teacher's training. She lives in her own home with her son and supports three nephews\/nieces who live with her. \r\n\r\nAfter finishing her teacher's training she decided to build her house. Her father had a big lot of land and divided it between his children. She was one of the beneficiaries and built her home on that lot. She has been a teacher for more than 8 years. She works from 12:15pm to 5:40pm and makes 5,900 meticais per month which is spent with household expenses and construction. She only manages to save a little because she has a domestic helper who makes 1,000 meticais per month to help her around the house. \r\n\r\nShe has had a loan with BIM (another bank) and was successful paying it back. This is her first loan with Hluvuku and Kiva. It is for 15,000 meticais and she intends to buy construction materials (cement, sand, tiles and others) to continue the house construction she started with the loan from BIM. \r\n\r\nShe is confident she will pay the loan ahead of schedule and request a new loan to furnish her house offering better living conditions to her family. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n \r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the USSR., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n \r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Gabriel, who has over seven years of experience in the pest control industry, launched his business in early May, 2011 after months of planning and preparation.  The grand opening of his business is timely, as it marks the beginning of the summer season, the busiest time of the year for the pest control industry.\r\n\r\nBorn and raised in Mexico, Gabriel came to the United States 14 years ago.  Before working in pest control, he worked for several years as a salesman in the music industry.  This experience took him all over the state of Texas and Northern Mexico.  From his accumulated experience, Gabriel half-jokingly says that if there is one thing he has learned about Americans, it is that they love good customer service.   Knowing this, he sees excellent customer service as being as much a part of his business as the expertise he provides.  He says that it is crucial to build and maintain customer relationships, because satisfied customers are the cheapest form of advertising.  As he points out, someone can look up pest control companies in the phonebook, but they are most likely to work with a company recommended to them by a friend.\r\n\r\nAs a native Spanish speaker, Gabriel says that being bilingual is helping him find a niche for his business within the Hispanic community.  \u201cThere is a lot of competition in this industry, but Hispanics are looking for someone they can speak Spanish with, and I think that helps me.  I\u2019m not the only one (who speaks Spanish), but I\u2019m one of the only ones with his own company.\u201d  Though he wants to continue building relationships within the Hispanic community, he also wants to connect his business with the greater community.  One way he is doing this is by going through neighborhoods, meeting people, and making them aware of the services he offers.\r\n\r\nThis loan from ACCION Texas-Louisiana helps Gabriel pay the necessary fees for registering his business. He says that the government has strict requirements for pest control, and that navigating through the paperwork can be as expensive as it is time-consuming.  It is important that he be officially registered and certified so that he can offer all of his expertise.  For example, he has yet to receive approval to treat termites, leaving him unable to provide one of the key services his business offers.  \r\n\r\nAside from helping Gabriel receive all of the necessary certifications, this loan is helping him purchase business cards and launch a small marketing campaign.  He wants to advertise his business in local newspapers and magazines.  Gabriel has already undertaken a less expensive form of advertising by walking through neighborhoods and handing out business fliers.  Before receiving this loan, Gabriel financed his startup costs with his personal savings and credit

This will will affect her work positively and let her do more high quality work and increase her income to live in better conditions.   Kifah is photographed in her office.

is a farmer in the Santa Lucia County, where he has lived for twenty years. He is 63 years old, but he still has the will to work and provide for his family. He has a 14 year-old that he wants to make sure finishes school. Manuel is hoping to receive the loan in order to improve the production of his lands. He will primarily buy fertilizer and fumigation equipment. He and his wife Benita hope to save for the future of their son. <\/p>\r\n<<h4>The Santa Lucia Communal Bank<\/h4> \r\n<p> Manuel is part of the newest Communal Banks in the recently developed Mifex Rural Finance Program.  All of the members of the Centro Agricola de Santa Lucia Communal Bank are part of an Association of Rice Farmers in Santa Lucia. Their association works cooperatively to help in the commercialization of the product after it has grown. They will use the micro-loans to prepare their lands and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each others' guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the Primero de Agosto Association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many micro-finance programs, but Mifex believes that is imperative for the communities we works with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties.<\/p> \r\n<p><em>Below is more information about Santa Lucia compiled by Luis Crespo and Robert Edgar of the Mifex team when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. Special thanks to Mario Balazantegui who provided expert insight and contributed to the development of the alliances with the local organizations. <\/em><\/p> \r\n<h4>Economy of Santa Lucia<\/h4> \r\n<p>Santa Lucia County has a population of about 33,000 people. The sector is fit for rice cultivating because it is not in the lowlands and therefore it is not at risk of flooding. There is also great access to water because of the Daule River, which is accessible to many of the farmers in the area. About 70% of the farmers have basic infrastructure for watering their crops. <\/p> \r\n<p>Rice production is the main economic activity of the area as about 80% of the people are rice farmers. Almost everyone is either directly or indirectly involved with rice production, as they produce, commercialize or participate in activities that add value to the product. Within the county, there is a small town also named Santa Lucia. The town is filled with many small businesses and it serves as the social and commercial hub of the area.  <\/p> \r\n<h4>Rice Farming in Santa Lucia<\/h4> \r\n<p>Most of the people in the Santa Lucia area are small farmers. They produce about 100 sacks of rice per hectare of land. In order to farm they first must prepare the lands by removing weeds and plowing. The farmers then fill an area with water to form what is known as a paddy field, because rice is a very water intensive crop. The rice seeds are either dispersed freely (the process is known as <i>boleo<\/i> in Spanish) or hand sowed. Once the rice has grown, most farmers rent machinery that helps them gather their production. A risk factor does exist in rice farming because of drought, but in Santa Lucia this is somewhat mitigated by the access to water form the nearby river.  <\/p> \r\n<h4>Access to Credit<\/h4> \r\n<p>The biggest struggle in the area has been the lack of credit. Because people do not count on formal financial services, they have turned to loan sharks for financing. They have been affected by expensive lines of credit that exceed 100% interest a year and can be as expensive as 240%. Intermediaries also exploit the farmers because of their outstanding debt. Farmers also lack skills and knowledge to commercialize their products and pay fair prices for their crops.  <\/p> \r\n<h4>Loan Use<\/h4> \r\n<p>The loans in this sector will be used to to buy soil, seeds, fertilizer and insecticides. They will also be used to prepare the land prior to farming, to plant the seeds and purchase other materials. The loan repayment schedule is also different from the typical micro-entrepreneur. Because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures, Mifex asks them only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 6 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the seventh and final month. <\/p> \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":25065,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Rice Farming","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Santa Lucia","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.183333 -80","type":"point"}},"partner_id":7,"posted_date":"2007-04-10T17:31:54Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":500,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Manuel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-04-26T00:51:50Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":71.43},{"due_date":"2007-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":71.43},{"due_date":"2007-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":71.43},{"due_date":"2007-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":71.43},{"due_date":"2007-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":71.43},{"due_date":"2007-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":71.43},{"due_date":"2007-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":71.42}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":71.43},{"due_date":"2007-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":71.43},{"due_date":"2007-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":71.43},{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":71.43},{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":71.43},{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":71.43},{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":71.42}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":72,"local_amount":72,"processed_date":"2007-06-08T09:15:21Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T06:54:04Z","rounded_local_amount":72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":21391},{"amount":44,"local_amount":44,"processed_date":"2007-08-09T23:16:24Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T06:54:04Z","rounded_local_amount":44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":40777},{"amount":44,"local_amount":44,"processed_date":"2007-08-22T18:10:13Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T06:54:04Z","rounded_local_amount":44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":45296},{"amount":328,"local_amount":328,"processed_date":"2007-12-18T18:08:23Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T06:54:04Z","rounded_local_amount":328,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":99050},{"amount":40,"local_amount":40,"processed_date":"2008-01-02T21:50:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T06:54:04Z","rounded_local_amount":40,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":106810}],"funded_date":"2007-04-12T00:51:50Z","paid_date":"2008-01-02T21:50:00Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":11747,"name":"Elvia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Elvia is involved in the sale of general and paper products.

This is 37-year-old Ester K. from Dar es Salaam. She is married and has two children, ages 5 and 9. Ester has been running a poultry business since 2002. Raising kuku (kuku means chicken in Swahili) is popular in Tanzania for a number of reasons. Firstly, raising chickens requires little start-up capital. You can start with a few and either add to them as you go or wait for them to multiply naturally! Secondly, they require little space, so sometimes you can just let them run around in your garden or compound. Thirdly, while they are growing they produce eggs, which can either be sold to provide a supplementary source of income, or eaten to provide a supplementary source of protein. Her business is doing well. She works at the business for eight hours per day, seven days per week and is assisted by one employee. Esther currently earns about $200 USD from her business. She is requesting a loan of $750 USD to buy more chicks and their feed. In the future, she plans to expand her business. Esther thanks you for your support!\r\n\r\n<p>SELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through micro-leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":212567,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To purchase chicks and feed","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Dar es Salaam","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-6.8 39.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-10-11T16:30:17Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":750,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Esther","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-10-25T18:12:51Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":900000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":90000},{"due_date":"2008-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":90000},{"due_date":"2009-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":90000},{"due_date":"2009-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":90000},{"due_date":"2009-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":90000},{"due_date":"2009-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":90000},{"due_date":"2009-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":90000},{"due_date":"2009-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":90000},{"due_date":"2009-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":90000},{"due_date":"2009-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":90000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":75,"local_amount":90000,"processed_date":"2008-11-25T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T04:22:49Z","rounded_local_amount":90412.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5348073},{"amount":75,"local_amount":90000,"processed_date":"2008-12-25T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:13:30Z","rounded_local_amount":90412.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9970659},{"amount":75,"local_amount":90000,"processed_date":"2009-01-25T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:16:14Z","rounded_local_amount":90412.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14886876},{"amount":75,"local_amount":90000,"processed_date":"2009-02-25T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:04:03Z","rounded_local_amount":90412.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20436136},{"amount":75,"local_amount":90000,"processed_date":"2009-03-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:56:26Z","rounded_local_amount":90412.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130409},{"amount":75,"local_amount":90000,"processed_date":"2009-04-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:24:57Z","rounded_local_amount":90412.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027211},{"amount":75,"local_amount":90000,"processed_date":"2009-05-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:14:28Z","rounded_local_amount":90412.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613249},{"amount":75,"local_amount":90000,"processed_date":"2009-06-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:02:00Z","rounded_local_amount":90412.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010332},{"amount":75,"local_amount":90000,"processed_date":"2009-07-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:38:42Z","rounded_local_amount":90412.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63232643},{"amount":75,"local_amount":90000,"processed_date":"2009-08-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:52:57Z","rounded_local_amount":90412.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73664459}],"funded_date":"2008-10-11T18:12:51Z","paid_date":"2009-09-15T21:52:57Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kay and Fred Tierney","image":92188}},{"id":73211,"name":"Susan Karin","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Susan es socia de Bancomunal El Pino.

Enclaro Vista Aligre, Ilog, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating two business ventures:  food vending and nipa (palm leaves that are woven together and used as roofing material). Her husband, Leopoldo, who is 56 years old, works as a laborer to earn his living and also helps in his wife's business activities.  They have six children who are 10 to  24 years old. \r\n\r\nRosie joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2002 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 14 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Rosie has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 15,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 15,000 \u2014 increasing the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 15th loan, she is borrowing PHP 19,500, which she intends to use to lease nipa so that she could continue to save up for their future.  Rosie M. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon \u2014 a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and

Besides paying for school fees and general expenses, she is using her profits to build a house on land that she recently purchased.\r\n<p>\r\nEarlier this year, Haelen took out a loan which helped her move her shop to a different location.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.
