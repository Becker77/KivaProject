It has produced famous thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, and Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. A civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged an already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural productivity and the manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent viable business prospects. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Working seven days a week and 16 hours a day, she earns about 1,700,000 SLL every month from this business. \r\n\r\nShe would like a loan in the amount of 4,000,000 SLL. Aminata requires a loan in order to buy more food and drinks for her business. She hopes that this loan will enable her to increase her monthly profits by approximately 200,000 SLL. \r\n\r\nIn the future, Aminata plans to send her children to the University of Sierra Leone.

He lives with his wife and a son on their land and they all work on together. He admits he once was not on the right path as he drank excessively. He is now a religious man after suffering an accident where he lost an eye. He hopes to invest his money in fertilizer and seeds for the fields. He is a very hard worker who saves in order to one day send his son to college. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Communal Banking in Baba<\/h4> \r\n<p>This borrower is part of the newest and largest Communal Bank in the recently developed Mifex Rural Finance Program. All of the members of the Centro Agricola de Baba Communal Bank are part of an Association of Rice Farmers in the county of Baba in rural Ecuador. Their association works cooperatively to cultivate rice and commercialize the product after it has grown. As an association, Centro Agricola helps the farmers by providing access to machinery and training services. The farmers from Centro Agricola have received special instruction on financial responsibility and accounting from Codemicro, an organization that specializes in training programs geared towards the rural sector.  \r\n<\/p> \r\n<p>The members of Centro Agricola de Baba will use the micro-loans to prepare their lands and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each others' guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the Centro Agricola de Baba Association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many micro-finance programs, but Mifex believes that is imperative for the communities we works with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties. <\/p> \r\n<p><em>Below is more information about Santa Lucia compiled by Luis Crespo and Robert Edgar of the Mifex team when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. <\/em><\/p> \r\n<h4>Economy of Baba<\/h4> \r\n<p>The people of Baba have been organized since the days of Gran Colombia when Ecuador was yet to be a country. The area has always been popular because of the extremely productive lands that gave way to cultivation of cacao for decades. Now Baba is a county in the province of Los Rios in the coastal region of Ecuador. For most of the latter part of the 20th Century it was a cacao and banana producing sector. Most of the surrounding areas of Baba in Los Rios are owned by large mulitnational  \r\ncompanies such as Dole, but Baba is a sector characterized by the small and informal farms. <\/p>\r\n<p>Rice production has now turned into the main economic activity of the sector as about 80% of the people are rice farmers. Cacao is still very popular in the area, but because of the long cultivation cycle people prefer to invest in rice. The lands in Baba are very fertile though, and most farmers in the sector often grow other crops, such as plantains and soy beans  \r\nas secondary sources of income.  Many farmers also keep livestock as emergency sources of food and income, commonly resorting to selling a chicken or pig if they are in need of cash. <\/p> \r\n<h4>Rice Farming<\/h4> \r\n<p>Most of the people in the Baba area are small farmers. They produce about 80 sacks of rice per hectare of land. In order to farm they first must prepare the lands by removing weeds, plowing and leveling the lands. This is the most difficult part for the farmers in Baba, who often lack the necessary machinery to properly plow the lands for rice production. After appropriately preparing the lands, the farmers fill an area with water to form what is known as a paddy field, because rice is a very water intensive crop. The rice seeds are either dispersed freely (the process is known as boleo in Spanish) or hand sowed. Once the rice has grown, most farmers rent machinery that helps them gather their production. <\/p> \r\n<h4>Access to Credit<\/h4> \r\n<p>One of the biggest struggles in the area has been the lack of credit due to the absence of any type of financial institution. \r\nBecause people do not count on formal financial finance, they have turned to loan sharks for financing. They have been affected by expensive lines of credit that exceed 100% interest a year and can be as expensive as 240%. Intermediaries also exploit the farmers because of their outstanding debt. Farmers also lack skills and knowledge to commercialize their products and pay fair prices for their crops. <\/p> \r\n<h4>Risks<\/h4> \r\n<p>The largest risk in the sector is due to absence of watering systems. Although Baba is in the province \u201cLos Rios\u201d (the rivers) there is severe problem with access to water. The lack of infrastructure in the sector does not allow the small farmers to benefit from the presence of the many rivers in the area. If the winter season is too dry, it is likely that the lands will not be sufficiently fertile for rice production in the summer. On the other hand, if there is too much rain there are not any drainage systems to prevent flooding and the crops are often ruined. Generally speaking though, Baba is a very productive sector where the lands yield all types of crops including rice, cacao, corn, watermelons, plantains, and soy beans. <\/p> \r\n<h4>Loan Use<\/h4> \r\n<p>The loans in this sector will mostly be used to to buy soil, seeds, fertilizer and insecticides. Many clients will use the capital towards renting machinery and equipment necessary to effectively work and prepare the fields. Clients also typically use a part of the loan to buy livestock in order to raise and have as reserves. The loan repayment schedule is different from the typical micro-entrepreneur because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures. Mifex asks our rural clients only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 6 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the seventh and final month. <\/p>\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":25850,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Rice Farming","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Baba","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-1.783333 -79.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":7,"posted_date":"2007-04-12T06:18:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1075,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gonzalo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-04-29T06:13:58Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1075,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":179.17},{"due_date":"2007-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":179.17},{"due_date":"2007-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":179.17},{"due_date":"2007-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":179.17},{"due_date":"2007-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":179.17},{"due_date":"2007-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":179.15}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":179.17},{"due_date":"2007-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":179.17},{"due_date":"2007-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":179.17},{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":179.17},{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":179.17},{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":179.15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":180,"local_amount":180,"processed_date":"2007-06-08T09:15:38Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T22:11:50Z","rounded_local_amount":180,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":21421},{"amount":86,"local_amount":86,"processed_date":"2007-07-13T22:32:07Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T22:11:50Z","rounded_local_amount":86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":31804},{"amount":70,"local_amount":70,"processed_date":"2007-09-07T19:20:16Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T22:11:50Z","rounded_local_amount":70,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":51890},{"amount":833,"local_amount":833,"processed_date":"2008-01-03T21:59:14Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T22:11:50Z","rounded_local_amount":833,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":107764}],"funded_date":"2007-04-15T06:13:58Z","paid_date":"2008-01-03T21:59:14Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":12167,"name":"Yeng","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Yeng C. is 35 years old, married and a mother of 3 children, who are students.

Selain itu sisa pinjaman juga digunakan untuk membeli pakan babi. Setelah 5 bulan dipelihara Ketut menjual anak-anak babi dari induk peliharaanya dan berhasil mendapatkan keuntungan sebesar Rp. 200.000,- per bulannya. Itu belum termasuk keuntungan dari penjualan 3 ekor babi penggemukan modalnya sendiri. Selanjutnya pada pinjaman kedua dengan jangka waktu sama yaitu 6 bulan, Ketut akan menambah 4 ekor bibit penggemukan dan tetap memelihara induknya juga. Nantinya dengan penambahan populasi babi ini akan diperoleh hasil yang lebih bagus lagi dari sebelumnya sehingga pinjaman DINARI juga bisa dikembalikan pada akhir periode pinjaman dan bisa segera dilanjutkan lagi dengan pinjaman selanjutnya. Karena hasil dari beternak babi ini sangat menjanjikan bagi Ketut Sitri dalam meningkatkan perekonomian keluarganya.","en":"Ni Ketut Sitri is a very diligent housewife.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He is 45 years old. Warlito is married and has 2 school-aged children. To make a living, Warlito owns & operates an agriculture business, earning income from planting and harvesting rice for sale. Warlito has been engaged in his business for over 20 years and earns approximately 28000 PHP per harvest.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Warlito joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and to have the ability to engage in business activities. Warlito has successfully repaid a previous loan of 30,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase fertilizers such as manure. Warlito is requesting a new loan of 35000 PHP which will again be used to purchase fertilizers such as manure. This will be the fifth loan taken out by Warlito from ASKI.

Eight years ago she got the idea to start raising cattle to contribute to the family finances, taking advantage of the space she had available on their land for this business. She is engaged in this business together with her husband.\r\n\r\nSlowly the number of cows increased and, with the increase, her clients started asking for more and more. With an endless list of requests, she has finally decided to increase the number of livestock she keeps and for this reason is requesting a loan. Be an important part of the growth of Nodira\u2019s business.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>More about Tajikistan and IMON International<\/b>\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He lives in Badian, Cebu.  He has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2005 and has improved his living conditions with the help of his loans from NWTF and through his own efforts. \r\n\r\nBy working hard in his livestock  business, Gaudencio is gradually making his family more economically stable. He now earns an average monthly income of PHP7,000. Gaudencio is borrowing PHP 12,000 to  fund his business operations. This will be his ninth loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. His previous loan of PHP10,000, which he paid off well within its term, was just another step in his journey towards economic freedom. Gaudencio aspires to elevate his family's living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the Dungganon way.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through this program, NWTF is empowering people to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Ziyovaddin is a loving and self-sacrificing father. Ever since he was very young Ziyovaddin has been around people raising animals.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She started her business nine years ago in the city of Valledupar, Cesar Department, where she learned everything related to this enterprise both technically and marketwise.\r\n\r\nWhen she moved to Barranquilla the first thing she did was conduct a presale and offer her products to stores, neighborhood hospitals, firms in the community and housewives in general thereby acquiring customers which she still has to this day because she strives to produce quality products that are fresh and of unequalled quality and are sold at good prices.  Her goal for later on is to expand her infrastructure, acquire machinery and appliances to mechanize her processes and in the long run acquire a house of her own.  \r\n\r\nCurrently, her biggest challenge is the little working capital she can count on to reach the desired growth and this is why she\u2019s calling on a Kiva loan, the first financing she\u2019s had with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, that she\u2019ll use to buy a rolling machine to knead the dough more efficiently and increase productivity to take advantage of the December season that contains family festivities where consumption of her products increases and Alba will be able to be more widely known and her sales potential will expand accordingly.\r\n\r\nHer present profit margin is 35% which is in accord with this type of business which from now with impulse from her market shows growth potential that will allow for increased profits as well as the her wellbeing level being supported financially with capital from her Kiva loan.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":939984,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

This is 23-year-old Ikupa M.. She is married and has one child, aged nine months. In 2007, Ikupa established her clothes business. She opens her business six days a week and  nine to twelve hours a day. Ikupa requires a loan in order to purchase more clothes in bulk. In the future, Ikupa plans to expand her business. She thanks you for your support.\r\n<P>\r\nSecond-hand clothes journey across the oceans from America and Europe and are then washed, ironed and sold in bulk by wholesalers in Dar es Salaam to retailers who then re-wash and re-iron them for sale on the streets of Dar es Salaam and the surrounding towns and villages. These clothes are becoming increasingly popular, especially among the younger generation, because they are so cheap and because of the general appeal of anything western or modern. Many people argue that the popularity of the West\u2019s cast-offs is damaging the local cloth and garment industry. There are many people who still appreciate the beauty of traditional Tanzanian dress; however, the growing market in used clothing and its importance to many micro-entrepreneurs cannot be denied.\r\n<P>\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of microcredit in Tanzania. The organization is devoted to the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through microfinance as a practical way to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women. Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets; because of this, they are deemed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support, hence poor access to basic needs and services. When a client needs working capital to buy a specific item, SELFINA buys the equipment for said client and extends a loan to her. The same equipment is then leased back to the client so they can use it while in process of paying back their loan, a process called a sale-and-leaseback arrangement. Once the loan has been repaid, SELFINA transfers the ownership of the equipment to the client. The advantage of microleasing over traditional microfinance loans is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":192581,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing

A goal over the long term is to buy other overlock sewing machines to improve her sewing and as well to continue investing in cosmetics, and to be able to provide schooling to her son.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Diane Lister, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":213609,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Comprar Zermat cosmetics and Romanel clothing","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Managua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.150833 -86.268333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":98,"posted_date":"2008-10-24T17:20:20Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":275,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Nicolasa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-11-07T22:04:42Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":5000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2009-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2009-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2009-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2009-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2009-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2009-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2009-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":625}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":34.38},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":34.38},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":34.38},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":34.38},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.38},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.38},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.38},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.34}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":34.38,"local_amount":625,"processed_date":"2008-12-07T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-15T09:56:17Z","rounded_local_amount":678.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9893332},{"amount":34.38,"local_amount":625,"processed_date":"2009-01-07T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T09:16:41Z","rounded_local_amount":678.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14816409},{"amount":34.38,"local_amount":625,"processed_date":"2009-02-07T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-15T08:18:31Z","rounded_local_amount":678.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20351116},{"amount":34.38,"local_amount":625,"processed_date":"2009-03-07T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T09:03:50Z","rounded_local_amount":678.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27038434},{"amount":34.37,"local_amount":625,"processed_date":"2009-04-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T09:39:12Z","rounded_local_amount":678.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35928737},{"amount":34.38,"local_amount":625,"processed_date":"2009-05-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T20:19:34Z","rounded_local_amount":678.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44383665},{"amount":34.38,"local_amount":625,"processed_date":"2009-06-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T16:24:15Z","rounded_local_amount":678.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52890157},{"amount":34.35,"local_amount":625,"processed_date":"2009-07-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T09:32:41Z","rounded_local_amount":678.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63111484}],"funded_date":"2008-10-24T21:04:42Z","paid_date":"2009-08-15T09:32:41Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Diane Lister","image":null}},{"id":73647,"name":"Lilia Gregoria","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Lilia Gregoria Uca\u00f1\u00e1n  D.

All but one are starting their businesses with these funds. We had the chance of talking to them all about the activities they plan to do with this loan. Only Anecia had her business set up before and will restock with this loan. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Belkis A. is the group representative. She will sell hair products. She will use her loan to buy shampoo, conditioner, a special strengthening treatment called Penetrait, anti-frizz serum (which sells specially well because the Dominican Republic weather is very humid and hair frizzes fast), and hair wax for durable hair styles. Belkis knows that Dominican women are very conscious about their hair and take very special care of it. This is why she is committed to offering good quality hair products at a good price.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nikaury E. and Alexandre M. will both sell clothes. Mostly pants, blouses, underwear and sandals. They will go to the flea market or to the Villa Consuelo commercial district to get their merchandise. At these two market places, they can purchase at better prices than most retail stores, which will allow them to realize larger profit margins for each sale.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yoselin will sell bedding, bedspreads, curtains and sheets. She buys them by the dozen and sells them by   the piece.<\/p>\r\n \r\n<p>Last but not least, Anecia has a fried food stand that opens at 3pm. While she was at our office in central Santo Domingo, her husband was attending the stand. ''But my customers say I do it better'' she says with a laugh. Her group mates agreed. She mostly sells fried chicken, crackling pork, fried sweet potatoes and tostones (crunchy fried plantains).<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Please help us support this group of entrepreneurs with this Kiva loan. Thank you!<\/p>\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1125,"image":{"id":304989,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics

She is 60 years old. Sopia is married and has one adult child. To make a living, Sopia owns & operates an \"alimango\" (mud crab) fishing business selling seafood products including fish and shrimp in the local community. Sopia has been engaged in her business for over 15 years and earns approximately 6,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Sopia joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Sopia is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell and to expand the business. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Sopia from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three units with offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

Unfortunately, Wilfredo says his life is not complete.  Some months ago, his girlfriend left him and took one of their daughters, whom he has not seen to this day.  He does not lose hope and is optimistic that he will get to see her soon.  Wilfredo remembers his younger daughter being disheartened, but a smile or a hug for his little Ximena makes her feel better.  He knows that he must continue to struggle on her behalf.

For instance, a high rate of unemployment makes people find and create jobs for themselves. Thus, there emerges a certain class of people who are not affected by the economic conditions in their country as they have their own households and can survive with their own cattle and land. The people in our story are such people, who have preferred to create their own happiness without the government\u2019s assistance. They would rather be independent entrepreneurs than always follow the changes in economic conditions and feel unsafe. \r\n\r\nAishahon I. is the leader of this group. She is 55 and has two children. Both of her sons are private builders. As for her husband, he and Aishahon are farmers and raise cattle. Sixteen years ago, they obtained land from the government and started farming. They started growing wheat and cotton. With great effort and tireless work, they have been able to achieve a decent income. They have been able to repair their house and marry off their son. At the moment, Aishahon needs a loan to purchase mineral fertilizers for cotton. She hopes to have a good harvest and, after selling the crops, to buy new furniture for her home. \r\n\r\n<u>Aishahon\u2019s partners:<\/u>\r\nIlgorbek A., 27, is married and has a son. He and his father own a pasture where they raise cattle. With their income, Ilgorbek has managed to obtain a college education, find a job and get married. Now Ilgorbek needs a loan to buy a washing machine as a present for his wife. \r\n\r\nYokutoi I., 27, is married and has two children. She used to manufacture clothes and sell them in the market. Later her husband organized a small shop within the house and now she sells foodstuffs. Yokutoi needs a loan to purchase foodstuffs to increase her turnover. \r\n\r\nHursanai A., 33, is the mother of two children. Her husband is a cattle breeder. As for Hursanai, she looks after cattle and sells milk. With the cattle breeding, Hursanai\u2019s family has built a new house. Hursanai needs a loan to purchase a cow. \r\n\r\n======================================\r\n\r\n<b>Where Did This Loan Come From?<\/b>\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance, a young and ambitious socially-focused MFI in Kyrgyzstan.\r\n\r\nMol Bulak Finance is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development on the basis of 3-Ps concept \u2013 <b>P<\/b>eople (building human capital and taking care of its customers and the society as well), <b>P<\/b>rofit (to be profitable to grow further) and the <b>P<\/b>lanet (taking care of the environment).

like many vendors on the streets in Trou-du-Nord, Haiti, sells small ingredients and morsels that are affordable to the impoverished population who mostly cook out of their homes or buy food on the street as opposed to restaurants. Celia meets a high demand with supplying these ingredients, but her kind and warm personality have helped her to be a preferred stop for many customers. She has now requested this loan from Esperanza to increase her capital so that she can reinvest in her business inventory while still having enough for savings, insurance and taking care of her four young children.\r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>NOTE: Celia is one of 10 micro-entrepreneurs in her Bank of Hope solidarity group, which have all gone through Esperanza's business training courses and will be accountable to each other for repaying their shares of this $1,200 loan together. Celia's group will receive and pay back this loan together - if a member is unable to pay in full on time, the group is responsible for making up the deficit before a payment can be made. Investors in this loan will receive an update on Celia's situation as well as that of the entire group.

She and her husband have four children. She runs a business where she sells kids' clothing and women's underwear. Savdagul started her business 28 years ago and has run it with both extreme care and seriousness. Her daughters help Savdagul with her business. It is an important source of income for her family of six, considering that her husband does not earn enough money. Savdagul has requested a loan of 2500 Somoni so that she can purchase additional inventory of winter clothing for kids and to continue developing her business. Thanks to this loan, she will be able to grow her business further and help feed her family. <p>\r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International<p>\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and its famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <p>\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <p>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<p>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\n\n\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":404167,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"To purchase more clothes in bulk  ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbozi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.75 32.75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-10-12T09:20:18Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":700,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Firida  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-10-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":900000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2009-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2010-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2010-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2010-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":150000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":116.67},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":116.66},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":116.67},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.67},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.66},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":116.67,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:45:44Z","rounded_local_amount":152833.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103868375},{"amount":116.66,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2009-12-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T16:46:04Z","rounded_local_amount":152833.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110757571},{"amount":116.67,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2010-01-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:35:07Z","rounded_local_amount":152833.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118146665},{"amount":116.67,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T11:16:42Z","rounded_local_amount":152833.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123984810},{"amount":116.66,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2010-03-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-10T13:01:18Z","rounded_local_amount":152833.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":129015483},{"amount":116.67,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2010-04-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-10T13:03:07Z","rounded_local_amount":152833.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136740489}],"funded_date":"2009-10-18T06:56:05Z","paid_date":"2010-12-10T13:03:07Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":147498,"name":"Ethel","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ethel R. is from the village of Bugwac, Catohugan Mahinog Camiguin Province.

The name of the bank has its origin in the Quechua language and translated into Spanish, means \"Cerro de Oro\" (Golden Hill).\r\n\r\nGraciela is 43 years old, married and has 5 children that are dependent upon her: Kelly is 24 and studies hotel administration in the Instituto Superior, Anali is 23 and studies in the Instituto \"San Rosa\" to become a teacher, Jonatan is 17 and studies in the pre-entrance program of the National San Antonio Abad del Cusco University, Libeth and Roxana study in school.  \r\n\r\nGraciela alternates her activities in the home with her business selling bread.  She has her own stand in the vicinity of the Plaza de Armos in Urcos.  She tells us that  from the time that she was very young she sold bread along with her mother from 4am until 9pm every day, but now she is independent.  She rents an oven with a number of business partners and there she makes her own bread.  Two years ago, she and her partners had the idea to make a special bread that they call \"chuta navide\u00f1a\" that has the same characteristics of the chuta bread (a bread typically sold in Cusco that is soft and round and very large and has a characteristic aroma) but they add fruit and raisins.  She has had her business selling chuta bread for a number of years now, and it has gone very well, thanks to all of the effort that she puts into her work.  She is an enterprising and hardworking woman who, in spite of the difficulties in life, is managing to help her children become professionals.  She needs a loan to buy more supplies such as flour, sugar, butter, fruit and raisins to prepare the chutas navide\u00f1as for the Christmas festivities, since this is the season when she can increase her sales.\r\n\r\nShe is very grateful for the opportunity provided through these means, and pledges to make her payments on time.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Lisa Grobar, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":453762,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bakery","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy supplies such as flour, sugar, butter, fruit and raisins to prepare the \u201cchutas navide\u00f1as\u201d for the Christmas festivities","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Urcos - Quispicanchi - Cusco","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":119,"posted_date":"2009-12-21T17:00:17Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":175,"lender_count":6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Graciela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-12-14T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":75.38},{"due_date":"2010-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":78.39},{"due_date":"2010-03-14T08:00:00Z","amount":81.53},{"due_date":"2010-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":84.79},{"due_date":"2010-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":88.18},{"due_date":"2010-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":91.73}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.38},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.44},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.54},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.67},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.86},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.11}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":26.38,"local_amount":75.38,"processed_date":"2010-01-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T10:42:28Z","rounded_local_amount":75.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118034413},{"amount":27.44,"local_amount":78.42,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T09:04:42Z","rounded_local_amount":79.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123872509},{"amount":28.54,"local_amount":81.54,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T08:19:12Z","rounded_local_amount":82.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128905768},{"amount":29.67,"local_amount":84.8,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T09:49:22Z","rounded_local_amount":85.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136633241},{"amount":30.86,"local_amount":88.19,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T08:49:05Z","rounded_local_amount":88.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144667708},{"amount":32.11,"local_amount":91.67,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:24:14Z","rounded_local_amount":92.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151851450}],"funded_date":"2009-12-21T18:36:18Z","paid_date":"2010-07-15T09:24:14Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lisa Grobar","image":264298}},{"id":168164,"name":"Susana Auxiliadora","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"En el municipio El Viejo de Chinandega, la se\u00f1ora Susana D. se dedica a su actividad de venta de hielo, helados y refrescos elaborados por ella misma con mucha dedicaci\u00f3n y con un toque de mucho sabor que hace que los clientes le compren dichos productos.\nElla est\u00e1 solicitando un cr\u00e9dito para invertirlo en la compra de linaza, cebada, az\u00facar, bolsas, canela, entre otros.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Anastacio works as a merchant.\r\n\r\n\r\nMarisol knits things like vests, sweaters, and also sews napkins and tablecloths.  This time she is asking for this loan to buy knitting needles, thread, sewing needles, adornments, and accessories.\r\n\r\n\r\nHer challenge is that there are days where she doesn\u2019t have enough money to fill all of her pending orders, so many times she has to backorder them.  It\u2019s also difficult for her to find the raw materials at good prices.  She prefers buying her products in quantity because they\u2019re less expensive.  One of her goals is to have a shop where she can show her embroidery and knitting.  She would also like to teach other people to knit and embroider.\r\n\r\n\r\nAll of the members are very happy and grateful and say, \u201cThanks to the loans, we are able to invest into our businesses.

Galmamat also grows apples, apricots and potatoes, which gives a seasonal income.\r\n\r\nIn order to further increase the number of livestock, Galmamat turned to the organization \"Bai Tushum & Partners\" for a loan in the amount of 70,000 som (KGS) for the purchase of additional heads of cattle.

With the loan from kiva, he would like to pay the workers who harvested beans. The profits from the business will be used to renovate his house and buy food for home consumptions.\n\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations.

He has always been dedicated to agriculture and he still maintains his farm with the help of his two sons. He is very happy that he will receive a loan that will help him be more productive. <\/p>\r\n<h4>Communal Banking in Baba<\/h4>\r\n<p>This borrower is part of the newest and largest Communal Bank in the recently developed Mifex Rural Finance Program. All of the members of the Centro Agricola de Baba Communal Bank are part of an Association of Rice Farmers in the county of Baba in rural Ecuador. Their association works cooperatively to cultivate rice and commercialize the product after it has grown. As an association, Centro Agricola helps the farmers by providing access to machinery and training services. The farmers from Centro Agricola have received special instruction on financial responsibility and accounting from Codemicro, an organization that specializes in training programs geared towards the rural sector. \r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>The members of Centro Agricola de Baba will use the micro-loans to prepare their lands and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each others' guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the Centro Agricola de Baba Association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many micro-finance programs, but Mifex believes that is imperative for the communities we works with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties. <\/p>\r\n<p><em>Below is more information about Santa Lucia compiled by Luis Crespo and Robert Edgar of the Mifex team when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. <\/em><\/p>\r\n<h4>Economy of Baba<\/h4>\r\n<p>The people of Baba have been organized since the days of Gran Colombia when Ecuador was yet to be a country. The area has always been popular because of the extremely productive lands that gave way to cultivation of cacao for decades. Now Baba is a county in the province of Los Rios in the coastal region of Ecuador. For most of the latter part of the 20th Century it was a cacao and banana-producing sector. Most of the surrounding areas of Baba in Los Rios are owned by large multinational companies such as Dole, but Baba is a sector characterized by small and informal farms. <\/p>\r\n<p>Rice production has now turned into the main economic activity of the sector as about 80% of the people are rice farmers. Cacao is still very popular in the area, but because of the long cultivation cycle people prefer to invest in rice. The lands in Baba are very fertile though, and most farmers in the sector often grow other crops, such as plantains and soybeans as secondary sources of income.  Many farmers also keep livestock as emergency sources of food and income, commonly resorting to selling a chicken or pig if they are in need of cash. <\/p>\r\n<h4>Rice Farming in Baba<\/h4>\r\n<p>Most of the people in the Baba area are small farmers. They produce about 80 sacks of rice per hectare of land. In order to farm they first must prepare the lands by removing weeds, plowing and leveling the lands. This is the most difficult part for the farmers in Baba, who often lack the necessary machinery to properly plow the lands for rice production. After appropriately preparing the lands, the farmers fill an area with water to form what is known as a paddy field, because rice is a very water-intensive crop. The rice seeds are either dispersed freely (the process is known as boleo in Spanish) or hand sowed. Once the rice has grown, most farmers rent machinery that helps them gather their production. <\/p>\r\n<h4>Access to Credit<\/h4>\r\n<p>One of the biggest struggles in the area has been the lack of credit due to the absence of any type of financial institution.\r\nBecause people do not count on formal financial finance, they have turned to loan sharks for financing. They have been affected by expensive lines of credit that exceed 100% interest a year and can be as expensive as 240%. Intermediaries also exploit the farmers because of their outstanding debt. Farmers also lack skills and knowledge to commercialize their products and pay fair prices for their crops. <\/p>\r\n<h4>Risks<\/h4>\r\n<p>The largest risk in the sector is due to absence of watering systems. Although Baba is in the province \u201cLos Rios\u201d (the rivers) there is severe problem with access to water. The lack of infrastructure in the sector does not allow the small farmers to benefit from the presence of the many rivers in the area. If the winter season is too dry, it is likely that the lands will not be sufficiently fertile for rice production in the summer. On the other hand, if there is too much rain, there are not any drainage systems to prevent flooding and the crops are often ruined. Generally speaking though, Baba is a very productive sector where the lands yield all types of crops including rice, cacao, corn, watermelons, plantains, and soybeans. <\/p>\r\n<h4>Loan Use<\/h4>\r\n<p>The loans in this sector will mostly be used to buy soil, seeds, fertilizer and insecticides. Many clients will use the capital towards renting machinery and equipment necessary to effectively work and prepare the fields. Clients also typically use a part of the loan to buy livestock in order to raise and have as reserves. The loan repayment schedule is different from the typical micro-entrepreneur because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures. Mifex asks our rural clients only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 6 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the seventh and final month. <\/p>\r\n "}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":25967,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Victor would like to make his farm more productive","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Baba","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-1.783333 -79.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":7,"posted_date":"2007-04-13T00:41:59Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":675,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Victor","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-04-29T20:07:23Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":675,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-05-29T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2007-06-29T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2007-07-29T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2007-08-29T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2007-09-29T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2007-10-29T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2007-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2007-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":112.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":54,"local_amount":54,"processed_date":"2007-06-18T19:23:07Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T22:09:01Z","rounded_local_amount":54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":24205},{"amount":54,"local_amount":54,"processed_date":"2007-07-20T17:09:33Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T22:09:01Z","rounded_local_amount":54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":33939},{"amount":54,"local_amount":54,"processed_date":"2007-08-20T18:19:58Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T22:09:01Z","rounded_local_amount":54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44795},{"amount":54,"local_amount":54,"processed_date":"2007-10-25T17:33:19Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T22:09:01Z","rounded_local_amount":54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":71888},{"amount":459,"local_amount":459,"processed_date":"2008-01-03T21:19:23Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T22:09:01Z","rounded_local_amount":459,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":107739}],"funded_date":"2007-04-15T20:07:23Z","paid_date":"2008-01-03T21:19:23Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":12215,"name":"Victoria","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Victoria cooks food at home and sells it to workers at various construction sites.

Her husband is working in Russia, as are many from her town. He sends home money to support the family, but the children are growing and to cover all the expenses Soima has a small business - selling children's clothing and shoes. At this time there is no permanent employment for women in the region, and that which there is is very low paying. Soima travels 170 kilometers from her home to the wholesale market to buy her goods. Having no permanent place to sell at, she travels between the area's markets. Sales are not great, but the profit covers the business's expenses with some leftover for the family. Soima decided to expand her business a little and came to Microinvest for a loan. She plans to use the laon to buy a new assortment of goods. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Russian by Anna Brown, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":285758,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Purchase of new inventory","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Isfara","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"40.116667 70.633333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":47,"posted_date":"2009-03-18T04:00:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":625,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Soima","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-03-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":2300,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":346.75},{"due_date":"2009-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":360.62},{"due_date":"2009-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":375.04},{"due_date":"2009-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":390.05},{"due_date":"2009-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":405.65},{"due_date":"2009-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":421.89}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":94.23},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.99},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":101.91},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105.99},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110.23},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":114.65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":94.22,"local_amount":346.75,"processed_date":"2009-04-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T22:05:44Z","rounded_local_amount":352.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36015984},{"amount":97.99,"local_amount":360.62,"processed_date":"2009-05-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T01:13:18Z","rounded_local_amount":366.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44599712},{"amount":101.91,"local_amount":375.04,"processed_date":"2009-06-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:57:36Z","rounded_local_amount":381.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52994154},{"amount":106,"local_amount":390.05,"processed_date":"2009-07-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-06T10:59:09Z","rounded_local_amount":396.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63215435},{"amount":110.23,"local_amount":405.65,"processed_date":"2009-08-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-10T10:24:48Z","rounded_local_amount":412.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73644928},{"amount":114.65,"local_amount":421.89,"processed_date":"2009-09-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-14T09:15:28Z","rounded_local_amount":428.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87084481}],"funded_date":"2009-03-18T10:23:11Z","paid_date":"2009-11-14T09:15:28Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Anna Hazen","image":1498099}},{"id":98255,"name":"Ushindi Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Doris owns a small shop in the Tengeru neighborhood of Arusha.

While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nMerlinda is married and has three school-aged children. To make a living, Merlinda operates a specialized retail store. The main source of income for the business comes from selling daily-use products such as bread, sugar, salt, shampoo, soap and toothpaste in the local community. Merlinda has been engaged in her business for over three years and earns approximately 6,000 Philippine pesos a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Merlinda joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Merlinda is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This will be the first loan taken out by Merlinda from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\n<b>About GDMPC:<\/b>\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three unit offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

Mwajuma used her first loan to increase her capital, allowing her to stock up on goods faster when they ran out. This loan has since been successfully repaid. With her second loan, Mwajuma aims to increase her stock and to continue to build herself a new house. \r\n\r\nMwajuma will share this loan with her loan group Flamingo, which totals 17 members. The members of the group will hold each other accountable for repaying the loans. \r\n\r\nIn the picture, Mwajuma can be seen on the far right wearing red.

The loans she has had so far have helped her to obtain a house which she didn't have before and she is now making improvements to it.  Another difficulty that Santos has is that she makes her sales from door to door and when her customers pay her she has to move about with cash on her.  She has been assaulted on a couple of occasions.  Santos' goal is to work very hard every day so that she can have premises for her business and finish her home.

Naddy is a Community Partner of CCT* in Dasmarinas, Cavite, where she and her husband, Eleomar, raise their family. Eleomar is a tricycle driver. They have two children, one of whom is in elementary school while the younger one is not yet attending school. Naddy reached only high school, but it does not mean she cannot perform well as a micro-entrepreneur.\r\n\r\nAt present, Naddy runs her own ready-to-wear (RTW) business. She started small, with her house as her working space. She would buy clothes which she thought would fit the taste of her potential customers, and sell them to friends, neighbors, and business connections. She also does direct selling, offering her customers products from beauty brands, such as Avon and MSE.  With these entrepreneurial efforts and the daily tricycle operation of Eleomar, their family earns around Php12,000 per month.\r\n\r\nTo help her grow her business, Naddy decided to borrow Php16,000. She plans to use this money to buy additional quantities of the affordable, yet quality, products that her customers look for. She knows that having enough capital on hand will enable her to purchase the orders for her valued customers even without initial down payments.\r\n\r\nNaddy is surely not exempted from the challenges of direct selling, such as delayed payments. But rather than focusing on her problems, Naddy instead focuses on making her business grow from a small beginning to big time growth. She hopes to have her own commercial space where more potential customers are within an arm\u2019s reach. She also desires to have her own tricycle. For her family, she desires good health and a sustained education for her children.\r\n\r\nAs a CCT community partner, she faithfully attends the group's weekly fellowship* meeting where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she received.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":716819,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing

She lives there with her husband and their 2 children in the house of a relative.  After years of arduous work in the fields, she decided 20 years ago to sell alfalfa.  To do this she rents land to cultivate alfalfa, and harvests the product to sell to the retail vendors.  Her daily work consists of harvesting and distributing alfalfa to the traders, and her children help her with this work. In the mornings she works in agriculture, and in the afternoons she works on another business selling vitamin supplements of a brand that is well known in the market.  Both of these activities have allowed her to have a better income for her family, because there is a lot of demand for these products in her community.  Since she lives in a rural area, she knows her customers and is able to give them personalized service in both businesses.

He is 37 years old. Edmar is married and has 2 school-aged children. To make a living, Edmar owns & operates a business venture in the retail sector running a specialized retail store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling sugar, rice, salt shampoo, soap and etc. in the local community. Edmar has been engaged in his business for over 3 years and earns approximately 7000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Edmar joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Edmar has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10,000 PHP from GDMPC. This previous loan was used to to improve and expand her business. Edmar is requesting a new loan of 12,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell in the local community. This loan will be the fifth loan taken out by Edmar from GDMPC. He plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of his family. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three units offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 285 tala or US $119 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Ruta  joined SPBD.  This is her 2nd loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Ruta 's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Ruta  T. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.89 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.5 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.

Every morning she cuts the alfalfa and sells it in large quantities to store-keepers and the public in her regional market. For all that she earns she has to protect the plants from the plague and other insects that affect the production of this plant. One of the biggest advantages of alfalfa is that it produces 3 times the seeds, so that the work results in good profits.

She has always demonstrated punctuality with her repayments, and she is thankful to be part of her communal group as all the members are very responsible and supportive people.
