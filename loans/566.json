He lives in his own home together with his wife Flor, 28 years old, and their two beloved children. He hopes to provide them with a better quality of life. Juan business is cultivating potatoes and corn. When the harvest has been collected he sells his products to wholesalers in the city of Tarma, where he already has various clients. His clients don't hesitate to wait to buy his entire stock of product because of the high quality he consistently provides. What he most likes about his work is planting seeds in his fields and to cultivate them. He has 15 years experience in his business.

The official name of this borrowing group is Tita M.'s group.\r\n\r\nTita is married and has five school-aged children. To make a living, Tita owns & operates a general store.

Tita has been engaged in her business for over one year and earns approximately 4200 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Tita joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Tita has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Tita is requesting a new loan of 8000 PHP which will be used to purchase new items to expand product offering. This will be the 2nd loan taken out by Tita from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay the tuition fees of her children. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines.

GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach.  Every client is trained in business management, basic health, life skills, financial management, profits and losses, and family values.  Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement.  GHAPE instils a sense of family and community within its clients and staff and has developed a strong bond of trust between the organization and its clients. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":222652,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Engine oil, kerosene, bananas, sugar cane, oranges, papaya, watermelon","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CM","country":"Cameroon","town":"Food-Market, Bamenda, NW.

She is 29 years old. Emmie is married and has 4 school-aged children. To make a living, Emmie owns and operates a business venture making and selling food. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling dried fish in the local community. Emmie has been engaged in her business for over 8 years with an approximate average monthly earnings of 3,000 PHP from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Emmie joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Emmie has successfully repaid a previous loan of 14,000 PHP from PMPC. Emmie is requesting a new loan of 7,000 PHP which will be used to invest in a sari-sari store and raising pigs, in addition to her existing business. This loan will be the 6th loan taken out by Emmie from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay her children's tuition fees so that they can finish their studies. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

He lives in his own home together with his wife Elizabeth, 28 years old, and their three beloved children. He wishes to provide them with a better quality of life. Cultivating farm land for Joel's life has been a necessary part of living. Since he was very young his parents always taught him to work the land so he will never want for anything. He decided to continue on in the family business and now he has his own fields where he harvests potatoes, peas, and flowers. Once harvested, he takes the products for sale in the wholesalers' market in the city of Tarma. What he most enjoys about his work is sowing the fields, knowing that this business is what provides for his family. He has 8 years in the business. The most difficult part of the work is having to cope with the sudden changes in weather because it impacts productivity. In the future he hopes to keep working hard to improve his plantations.

She is 33 years old. Luzviminda is the group leader of a 10-member group loan offered by ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. \r\n\r\nLuzviminda is married and has 3 school-aged children. To make a living, Luzviminda owns and operates a business in the food sector making and selling food. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling crispy pork skin \"chicharon\" in the local community. Luzviminda has been engaged in her business for over 5 years and earns approximately 8000 PHP a month for these activities. \r\n\r\nIn 2006, Luzviminda joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Luzviminda has successfully repaid a previous loan of 30000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Luzviminda is requesting a new loan of 37000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional inventory and working capital. This loan will be the 9th loan taken out by Luzviminda from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand the her business.\r\n\r\nAbout ASKI: ASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 38 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs. \r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She makes maternity clothes, an activity she began 4 years ago when she was working as a sales assistant in a shop selling dressmaking supplies. From there was born the idea of becoming independent and starting her own business venture. She installed herself in a location, which her husband staffed for over a year while Socorro trained in design and sewing with the National Learning Service. The National Learning Service is an institution which invests in the social and technical skills development of the Colombian workforce, providing free professional training courses to support people's development in activities which contribute to the social, economic and technological development of the country.\r\n\r\nOnce she had learned her trade this way, Socorro focused on the line of maternity wear that she still sells in her shop today. Her Kiva loan is the first finance she has had from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, and with it she will buy materials and supplies for dressmaking, because she is bringing out new collections to please her customers. Her aim is to consolidate her store in the north of the city, and to build it up over time into a source of income and employment for her family. Her greatest challenge is securing her position in the market, because the competition is stiff and, because her clothes are of very good quality, her costs are high. While she works to achieve her dreams she is working at a profit of no less than 48%, and every day she works to ensure this is stable and even to improve on it."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":819214,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"To buy materials and supplies for dressmaking.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2011-08-01T07:01:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":625,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Socorro","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-07-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1070000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":170661},{"due_date":"2011-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":173249},{"due_date":"2011-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":176569},{"due_date":"2011-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":179954},{"due_date":"2011-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":183403},{"due_date":"2012-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":186164}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":99.69},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":101.19},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":103.14},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":105.11},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":107.13},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":108.74}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":99.69,"local_amount":170661,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-17T08:02:21Z","rounded_local_amount":175445.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227320516},{"amount":101.19,"local_amount":173249,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:05:20Z","rounded_local_amount":178106.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232803641},{"amount":103.14,"local_amount":176569,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:18:29Z","rounded_local_amount":181519.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238614722},{"amount":105.11,"local_amount":179954,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-25T08:51:45Z","rounded_local_amount":184999.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244568675},{"amount":107.13,"local_amount":183403,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:07:55Z","rounded_local_amount":188545.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250780011},{"amount":108.74,"local_amount":186164,"processed_date":"2012-01-18T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T10:19:38Z","rounded_local_amount":191383.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257188404}],"funded_date":"2011-08-03T15:51:52Z","paid_date":"2012-02-15T10:19:38Z","journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Rosa Oswald","image":null}},{"id":324111,"name":"Abdallah","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Abdallah is a 28-year-old married man, working since December 2001 at selling used spare parts.

This is thirty-eight-year-old Amina from Dar es Salaam; she is married and has four children. Amina runs a small stall from which she sells tomatoes in downtown Dar es Salaam. The Swahili word for this type of outside shop, or stall, is genge.<P> A genge is usually a very basic structure made of wood, with a tin roof, which sells general items such as onions, tomatoes, chilli, oil, rice, and dried fish. It is the kind of place local people send their children running to fetch something when they are in the middle of cooking the evening meal, and don\u2019t have time to go all the way to the market to buy the missing ingredient. <P>Amina started her stall in 2000 and has been earning monthly profits of US$ 150 from it since. This is Amina\u2019s second loan from SELFINA; she successfully repaid her first loan of US$ 275. She is now requesting US$ 625 in order to buy large quantities of tomatoes in bulk and to renovate her stall. Thank you for supporting Amina in her efforts to improve the volume and sales of her business!\r\n\r\n<P>SELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility as a practical way to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women. <P>Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions as they lack tangible collateral assets. This leads to poor financial support hence the poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. <P>When a client needs working capital to buy a specific item, SELFINA buys the equipment for said client and extends a loan to her. The same equipment is then leased back to the client so they can use it while in process of paying back their loan \u2013 a process called a sale and leaseback arrangement. Once the loan has been repaid, SELFINA transfers the ownership of the equipment to the client. <P>The advantage of microleasing over traditional microfinance loans is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":191811,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To renovate her stall and to buy produce in bulk","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Dar es Salaam","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-6.8 39.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-08-30T01:10:20Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":625,"lender_count":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Amina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-09-13T04:38:25Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":700000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":70000},{"due_date":"2008-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":70000},{"due_date":"2008-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":70000},{"due_date":"2009-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":70000},{"due_date":"2009-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":70000},{"due_date":"2009-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":70000},{"due_date":"2009-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":70000},{"due_date":"2009-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":70000},{"due_date":"2009-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":70000},{"due_date":"2009-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":70000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":63,"local_amount":70560,"processed_date":"2008-10-11T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-20T07:18:46Z","rounded_local_amount":73269,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356192},{"amount":62,"local_amount":69440,"processed_date":"2008-11-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T04:18:31Z","rounded_local_amount":72106,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5347934},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":70000,"processed_date":"2008-12-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:09:00Z","rounded_local_amount":72687.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9970508},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":70000,"processed_date":"2009-01-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:13:23Z","rounded_local_amount":72687.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14886725},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":70000,"processed_date":"2009-02-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:02:17Z","rounded_local_amount":72687.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20435985},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":70000,"processed_date":"2009-03-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:54:46Z","rounded_local_amount":72687.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130283},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":70000,"processed_date":"2009-04-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:23:08Z","rounded_local_amount":72687.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027114},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":70000,"processed_date":"2009-05-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:12:50Z","rounded_local_amount":72687.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613154},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":70000,"processed_date":"2009-06-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:00:56Z","rounded_local_amount":72687.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010237},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":70000,"processed_date":"2009-07-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:37:45Z","rounded_local_amount":72687.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63232548}],"funded_date":"2008-08-30T04:38:25Z","paid_date":"2009-08-15T18:37:45Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":65134,"name":"Mwanajuma's Mkorofi Si Mwenzetu.

This group hopes to use their first microfinance loan to finance current businesses, or in the case of the group\u2019s coordinator, Leoncia, finance two new entrepreneurial activities.  \r\n\r\nLeoncia, mother of 5 (ages: youngest 16, oldest 30) resides in Santiago and plans to split her loan funds amongst three different entrepreneurial activities.  For as long as she can remember, Leoncia has been selling corn and ice-cream from her house and to local \u201ccolmados\u201d, or small grocery stores.  In addition to this business, Leoncia plans to finalize the start of two new product sales: candy and shoes.  Leoncia will make her own candy from her house and similarly to her corn and ice-cream sales, will sell the candy in two different-sized packages from her home and at local colmados.  Leoncia will also sell shoes for men, women and children through catalog sales.  Leoncia is dedicated to the repayment of her loan since she wants to own her own home.    \r\n\r\nOther members of Leoncia\u2019s microfinance bank run similar entrepreneurial activities including undergarment, fried food, accessory, and cloth sales.    \r\n\r\nOn behalf of Esperanza and this group of business entrepreneurs, we would like to thank you for your support!

Angel\u2019s business has seen much growth and so has his family. He is married with two children ages two and six. Even though business is doing well, Angel explains that things are still tight, especially because of the current recession. No matter what, he says opening his own business was the right decision both personally and professionally.  Self-employment and serving his clients has given him a strong sense of honor while creating a legacy for his children.  Angel looks forward with determination as he grows a healthy business.\n\nAngel started his electronics wholesale business in May 2006, because he wanted to go into business for himself. To start his business, he used credit cards and a loan from family and friends, but he is happy to have found ACCION USA because they offer him credit that is much more affordable and dependable. \n\nHe says his greatest success has been importing electronics equipment from other countries, like China. He will use part of this loan to purchase 100 cell phones from China. It's important to increase his stock in cutting-edge items that his customers demand.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Feliciana is now borrowing PHP 6,500 to fund her operations. This will be her fifth loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 4,500, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Feliciana aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future wellbeing by following the Dungganon way.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

She lives with her husband, Jose, and their 2 children, Claudio and Mayela, in a house they own in Tambo.  Margarita closed her locutorio business--where she sold phone services--a while back because she didn't have enough capital to keep it going.  She has managed to save a bit of money since then with help from her husband who is an auto mechanic.  She used the money to buy a car that she leases for use as a taxi.  The driver pays her 30 new soles a day for the lease, income that helps to pay household expenses.  The car doesn't require a lot of maintenance because her husband keeps it in perfect condition.  He changes the car's oil and checks it regularly for problems.  Now she wants to pull together enough money to re-open her first business because she is sure it will be a big success this time.  Margarita belongs to the IDME community bank and this is her twenty-fourth MFP loan.  She hopes you will help her to continue working toward her goals.

She believes that with Paglaum\u2019s help, and with the patience & diligence of her husband, she is looking forward to being a successful vendor someday and can own a stall at the public market.

Es una peque\u00f1a comunidad rural de aproximadamente dos mil habitantes. Sus pobladores se dedican a la producci\u00f3n de leche y siembra de caf\u00e9. Tiene un relieve irregular y mucho del terreno se mantiene como bosque tropical h\u00famedo. La comunidad tiene paisajes muy pintorescos que combinan el bosque tropical con dos lindas lagunas, plantaciones de caf\u00e9 y lecher\u00edas. El Sauce se localiza aproximadamente a hora y media en bus de Turrialba, el centro de comercio m\u00e1s cercano. Sin embargo, varias veces al a\u00f1o el camino se vuelve intransitable por las lluvias que azotan la zona. Este es sin duda uno de los principales desaf\u00edos para la comunidad. \n\nCuando no exist\u00edan actividades muchas personas optaron por salir a buscar trabajos en Turrialba o en fincas bananeras ubicadas en la Zona Atl\u00e1ntica de Costa Rica. Actualmente los precios del caf\u00e9 y la leche han mejorado, por lo tanto los vecinos buscan c\u00f3mo invertir en proyectos en la misma zona y de esta forma evitar migrar.\n\nHace dos a\u00f1os, se instal\u00f3 en la comunidad una planta de elaboraci\u00f3n de quesos de la Asociaci\u00f3n de Productores de Leche de El Sauce. Por lo tanto, en los \u00faltimos dos a\u00f1os don Guido ha ido especializ\u00e1ndose en la producci\u00f3n de leche que luego vende a esta planta. \n\nDon Guido desea obtener un microcr\u00e9dito por \u00a2670.000(seiscientos setenta mil colones) para comprar m\u00e1s vacas y as\u00ed aumentar la producci\u00f3n de leche.

Dice que por d\u00eda logra producir aproximadamente 20 litros de leche y con m\u00e1s vacas su producci\u00f3n aumentar\u00eda a 70 litros diarios por lo cual esta muy emocionado de poder ver como su negocio crece y se fortalece.\n\nDon Guido es socio de la Asociaci\u00f3n de Productores de El Sauce, una de las 100 organizaciones socias de EDESA en Costa Rica. Este ser\u00e1 su noveno pr\u00e9stamo y con \u00e9l espera continuar creciendo a nivel personal y econ\u00f3mico. Tambi\u00e9n destaca que gracias a este tipo de organizaciones y medios facilitadores de cr\u00e9dito puede dedicar m\u00e1s tiempo a las actividades productivas. \n","en":"Guido V. J. is 37 years old. He lives with his wife and two children in a community called El Sauce in Santa Teresita de Turrialba, Province of Cartago. This is a small rural community with around two thousand people. They are work producing milk and growing coffee. It has an irregular terrain and a lot of it is maintained as humid tropical forest. The community has traditional landscapes that mix with the tropical forest, with two nice lagoons, coffee plantations and milk factories. El Sauce is located about an hour and a half from Turrialba, the closest commercial center. However, several times a year, the road is closed due to the heavy rain in the area. This is without a doubt one of the main challenges of the community.\r\nWhen there was nothing to do in town, a lot of people decided to go to Turrialba for work or to banana farms in the Atlantic coast in Costa Rica. Right now, coffee and milk prices have improves, so the neighbors are looking for ways to invest their money in the area and avoid migrations.\r\nTwo years ago, he installed a cheese manufacturing company in his community for the El Sauce\u2019s Milk Producer\u2019s Association. Therefore, Guido has been focusing in the production of milk during this time, that he later on sells to this plant.\r\nThis time, Guido would like to get a \u00a2670.00 loan (six hundred and seventy colones) to purchase more cows and increase the production of milk. He knows that having more cattle will imply greater sacrifices, but he wants to support his family so he's willing to make the effort.\r\nRight now, Guido milks his cows in a small wooden facility that we turned into a milking room. He says that he\u2019s able to produce around 20 liters of milk a day and with more cows his production will reach 70 liters, so he's very excited about seeing his business grow and get stronger.\r\n\r\nLuis is a member of the El Sauce Farmers Association, one of the 100 member organizations of EDESA in Costa Rica. This will be his ninth loan. He hopes to continue growing at a personal level and financial level. He also believes it\u2019s important to mention that thanks to these type of organizations he is able to devote more time to productive activities.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by

He is 35 years old, married, and has three school-aged children. To make a living, Warlito owns and operates a sari-sari (variety) retail shop selling both food and daily use products in the local community. Warlito has been engaged in his business for over five years and earns approximately 5,500 PHP per month from these activities.\r\n<br>In 2009, Warlito joined Kiva partner, HSPFI, to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and ability to engage in business activities. He has successfully repaid a previous loan of 8,000 PHP from HSPFI. This loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Warlito is requesting a new loan of 11,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional inventory and as working capital. This loan will be his third from HSPFI. He plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand his business. \r\n<p>\r\n<b>About HSPFI<\/b><br>\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n<p>\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, we created this template for our field staff to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.

They have 1 child who is 9 years old. \r\n\r\nMielin joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2007 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 7 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Mielin has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 7,000 PHP helped her earn a monthly profit of 20,000 PHP, thus uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 8th cycle loan, she is borrowing 12,000 PHP, which she intends to use as additional working capital for the general store so that she can continue to save up for the future and for her business. \r\n\r\nMielin G. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

While each member receives an individual loan, they are all responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is Linda M.\u2019s Group.\r\n\r\nTo make a living, Linda owns and operates a rice retailing business, selling to her neighbors and friends. She has been engaged in this business for ten years and earns approximately $125 a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Linda joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10,000 PHP from PMPC. \r\n\r\nShe is now requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP which will be used as additional capital for her business. This will be her 4th loan from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the living standards of her family.\r\n\r\nAbout PMPC: \r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

married and has an adult daughter, Marina, who is 20 years old.  They live in Nikipol.  Yelena is involved in retail sales of children's clothing.  She always carries quality merchandise to satisfy every budget and taste, and this is why her merchandise is always in demand, and she has regular customers.  Yelena started her business 11 years ago.  At that time, she worked at a market, but then transferred her sales from the market to a store.  Now her merchandise does not get worn and dirty, and she has more space to display the clothing.  Besides, Yelena carefully selects the merchandise she buys and, thus, established herself as an experienced and diligent entrepreneur.  Yelena needs financial assistance in the form of a loan of 6,000 hryvnia to pay for her daughter's second semester of university study.  Yelena does not have such a large sum on hand, but the payment needs to be made right away and in full.  Obtained funds will help Yelena to pay for her daughter's education directly, and then she will be able to repay the loan gradually.  Being a single mother, Yelena understands that she has no one to count on and, hence, relies on the loan from Kiva.

She will use the loan to buy more materials to make fish traps. In this way, she believes, she will earn more income for her family. The loan will also be used to help her get started in a new business. \r\n\r\nCEVI is reaching out to more people, especially the poor, to start and have their own business. It helps people provide a livelihood for their families. CEVI is not only giving credit but training and insurance coverage as well.

Jorge Ch\u00e1vez II communal bank, Tarapoto District, San Martin Province, San Martin Department. She is 54 years old and married, with two dependent children.\r\n\r\nWishing to see her children become professionals, and have their own money in order to achieve this, she decided to start her own business. She tells us that she has faced many difficulties in her life, but her characteristic fighting spirit and her desire to get ahead compelled her to start her business preparing and selling beverages, such as different kinds of chicha (traditional Peruvian corn drinks), as well as sodas. Elci sells these drinks in her own home, and also goes into the streets to sell them. Little by little she became well-known among her customers, who incluD. her neighbors, drivers, visitors to the city and friends. She has been well-received and her sales are going well, both in the morning and in the afternoons. \r\n\r\nWith this loan of 1,000 soles, she plans to purchase ingredients for her drinks, including 2 kilos of corn and sugar, which she buys daily. She will also purchase other ingredients to add to her drinks, including cloves, cinnamon, pineapple and ice, as well as firewood and sodas in different sizes and flavors.\r\n\r\nElci is dedicated to continuing her beverage sales, but dreams of opening a well-equipped restaurant in order to give her customers better service and attention.

Banana is a fruit, which they harvest two times a week.  They sell it from their own farm to the merchants who visit them.\r\n\r\nTo Jesusa, the farming work is not complicated.  She wants to devote herself to buying and selling bananas.  That is the way she can get greater earnings for her household.  That is the reason she carefully clears her banana fields of shrubs.

The additional income resulting from this loan will enable Benson to pay school fees for his children. In five years' time, he hopes to have expanded his dairy farming by acquiring four more dairy cows.

The group is comprised of ten members.  Each one of them works day to day at their business activities .  They do this in an area with scant resources in the city of Santo Domingo.  The group is located to the north of the city.  The members work in established businesses in their own homes and or other places or in an itinerant manner.  They mostly sell clothes, footwear, accessories, cosmetics, food, and other miscellaneous products.\r\n\r\nFrancisca\u2019s family is maD. up of her three children and their parents.  They live in a rented home, which is a simple structure maD. of wood.  This mother has been very dedicated to her work.  She does this to help her children be able to get ahead, become professions, get an education, and form their own families.  Her most difficult challenge has been always working to bring in extra income for her family.\r\n\r\nFrancisa\u2019s business is selling bacon and pork.  She prepares the meat in order to sell for a better price and to be able to save more.  She has been engaged in this business activity for two years.  She tells us that she started thanks to motivation from some friends and some money that she was able to get together with her husband.  Then she was able to apply for loans from Esperanza, and she was able to invest.  Francisca has now had three loans with Esperanza Internacional.  She is very grateful because she has been able to move forward, and she has been able to invest in her business.  She will use this new loan to buy several pounds of bacon and pork.\r\n\r\nHer story is being used to represent the other members of her group. Her story also represents Esperanza\u2019s other clients, the Haitians (most of whom have immigrated to the Dominican Republic from Haiti, some of them recently) as much as the Dominicans. They generally live in very poor communities.  This zone, like a lot of other zones with scarce resources in the Dominican Republic, lacks potable water and steady electricity. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2550,"image":{"id":707030,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Butcher Shop","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To buy bacon and pork","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"DO","country":"Dominican Republic","town":"Santo Domingo Norte","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"19 -70.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":44,"posted_date":"2011-02-08T15:50:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2550,"lender_count":58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Francisca","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tomasa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lucrecia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yocasta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Leonida","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lucrecia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Victoria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Leondrina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Julia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Felipa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-01-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"DOP","disbursal_amount":94500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":2550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":7909.17},{"due_date":"2011-01-27T08:00:00Z","amount":7300.73},{"due_date":"2011-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":7437.02},{"due_date":"2011-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":7575.91},{"due_date":"2011-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":7717.28},{"due_date":"2011-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":7861.35},{"due_date":"2011-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":8008.1},{"due_date":"2011-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":8157.62},{"due_date":"2011-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":8309.89},{"due_date":"2011-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":8465.02},{"due_date":"2011-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":8623.02},{"due_date":"2011-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":7134.89}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":213.42},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":197.01},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":200.68},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":204.43},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":208.24},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":212.13},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":216.09},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":220.13},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":224.24},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":228.42},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":232.68},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":192.53}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":815.54,"local_amount":30222.83,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T08:34:52Z","rounded_local_amount":30256.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195991247},{"amount":420.37,"local_amount":15578.63,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T10:55:23Z","rounded_local_amount":15595.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201275319},{"amount":436.22,"local_amount":16165.72,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T10:54:52Z","rounded_local_amount":16183.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206142579},{"amount":452.66,"local_amount":16774.91,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:07:11Z","rounded_local_amount":16793.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211215575},{"amount":425.21,"local_amount":15757.91,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T10:59:12Z","rounded_local_amount":15775.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216493952}],"funded_date":"2011-02-09T00:00:38Z","paid_date":"2011-07-15T10:59:12Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ginny Kalish"}},{"id":274979,"name":"Saba Allah Ditta Masih's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Saba lives in Mian Channu, a small city known for its agriculture industry in Punjab, Pakistan.

That does not apply to Ni Putu Warniasih. She is a mother of three. Two of her three children are in elementary school. That condition creates the needs to cover school tuitions in addition to the living costs. One of her obsessions is to have the children to get the highest education possible so they can transform their life to be better than their parents. Although her husband is selling vegetables door to door, Ni Putu Warniasih does not want to sit around and do nothing. Utilizing a small lot in her yard, she and her husband made a small shed with three compartments. The first compartment is to grow the piglets, the second compartment is for the sow and the third compartment is for breastfeeding. With the loan from Dinari, Ni Putu Warniasih can buy a sow that will soon deliver the piglets which will then occupy the shed. She plan on harvesting every three months. She decides to do so to get a fast turn around to allow her to use the profit for additional capital and to help cover her family's living expense. \r\n\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Bahasa Indonesia by Arliadi Mahadi, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\n\r\nDi adat Bali kuno, seringkali muncul pemahaman bahwa wanita hanya diam dirumah untuk merawat anak dan melayani suami. Namun, hal itu tidak berlaku bagi Ni Putu Warniasih. Ni Putu Warniasih adalah ibu dengan 3 orang anak. Dua dari tiga anaknya sudah mengenyam pendidikan di bangku Sekolah dasar ( SD ). Kondisi seperti itu tentunya membutuhkan banyak biaya, baik untuk kebutuhan sehari \u2013 hari atau biaya sekolah. Satu keyakinan Ni Putu Warniasih adalah ia berkeinginan anaknya dapat menempuh pendidikan setinggi mungkin sehingga mereka akan dapat mengubah hidupnya menjadi lebih baik atau menjadi lebih baik dari orang tuanya. Walaupun suaminya berprofesi sebagi pedagang sayuran keliling, hal itu tidak membuat Ni Putu Warniasih berdiam diri saja. Dengan memanfaatkan sepetak tanah dibelakang rumahnya, Ni Putu Warniasih dengan suaminya membuat sebuah kandang dengan 3 ruangan. Ruangan pertama untuk anak babi yang digemukkan, ruang 2 untuk induk dan ruang 3 untuk induk yang menyusui. Dengan pinjaman dari Dinari, Ni Putu Warniasih membeli induk babi yang sudah dikawinkan.

Palm kernels are processed through various stages to obtain the oil, which is used to prepare many local dishes. She supplies her oil to food vendors. However, her production is on a small scale because of her low working capital.  The loan would allow Fati to buy more palm kernels and an electric milling machine; the machine would increase her efficiency in producing larger quantities.

Los padres de Marcial  son personas dedicadas al cultivo de todo tipo de frutas, y \u00e9l desde peque\u00f1o apoyaba a su padre en lo que le encomendara. A los 15 a\u00f1os sinti\u00f3 inclinaci\u00f3n por la carpinter\u00eda, por ello que busc\u00f3 trabajar con personas con este oficio; empez\u00f3 pasando maderas, cepillando retazos y finalmente, de a pocos, empez\u00f3 con el lijado. Desde entonces decidi\u00f3  independizarse, cultivaba sus propios productos y con las ganancias invert\u00eda en m\u00e1quinas y herramientas de carpinter\u00eda.

","en":"Marcial is 34 years old and has been living with his partner for 11 years. He is the father of 3 boys and now they live in their own house. Marcial's parents grow all types of fruit and ever since Marcial was little he has helped his father out where he can. When he was 15 he became interested in carpentry so he looked for work with people who worked in this profession. He began by passing wood, brushing pieces and finally, little by little, he began sandpapering. Since then he has decided to become independent, growing his own products and investing the profits in machines and tools for his carpentry. He has been working in this way for two months but it is still not very profitable because he still does not have all of the tools he needs so it takes a lot of time to make furniture. For this reason he also works as a driver and cares for his crops, where his wife is his greatest support. With these three businesses he is able to support his family. Despite being new to carpentry, Marcial is very happy in this job because he says making each piece of furniture takes imagination and creativity. Now he would like to buy merchandise to be able to open a warehouse that his wife would take care of and which would mean an additional income. <p>\r\nMarcial is a new client of MFP, which is why he is committed to meeting his payments in agreement with the timetable established by his credit assessor. He also has high expectations that his communal bank will work well. The money he is asking for will be divided into two parts: a certain amount will be used to buy sandpaper and nails of a variety of sizes for his carpentry work, the rest will buy merchandise to turn his dream of a warehouse in his house into a reality.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Lara Francis, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":284496,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Carpentry","sector":"Construction","themes":null,"use":"To buy carpentry materials and merchandise for his warehouse","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-03-19T12:10:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marcial","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-02-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-27T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":325}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":325,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2009-08-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:27:59Z","rounded_local_amount":1064.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73640627}],"funded_date":"2009-03-19T12:41:48Z","paid_date":"2009-09-15T19:27:59Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lara Francis","image":null}},{"id":97963,"name":"Kehinde","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Kehinde F. is a hair stylist who also sells hair extensions and hair creams.

They ask for help from their community because currently, as was the case in the time of the Inca,  there exists the famous AYNI system (a form of communal work where neighbors help each other on their lands at sowing and harvest time).  Agustina grows potatoes and corn which she then sells.  This is how she supports herself and helps her children with their studies.  Agustina herself wasn't lucky enough to study at secondary level and she started working on her parents' land when she was a very little girl.  Today she understands that studying is very important if her children are to have a better opportunity in life.  She is requesting a loan to invest in buying corn and potatoes to sow on her lands and harvest next year.\r\n\r\nThe other members of the group also farm and raise young animals.\r\n\r\nAgustina is grateful for the loan which she will receive and pledges to continue working hard to make her repayments and improve her business."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4475,"image":{"id":645394,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To invest in buying corn and potatoes to sow on her lands and harvest next year","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Chinchero - Urubamba - Cusco","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":119,"posted_date":"2010-11-21T20:50:12Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":4475,"lender_count":101,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Modesta ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosario ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alejandrina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Judith ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Zonia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Grimaldina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Gregorio ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Guido ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Agustina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dominga ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jenara ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Cleofe ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eusebio ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yenny ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Balvina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-11-17T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":12550,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":4475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":1892.31},{"due_date":"2011-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":1968.04},{"due_date":"2011-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":2046.75},{"due_date":"2011-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":2128.58},{"due_date":"2011-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":2213.67},{"due_date":"2011-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":2300.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":674.75},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":701.75},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":729.82},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":758.99},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":789.34},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":820.35}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":674.75,"local_amount":1892.31,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T12:27:02Z","rounded_local_amount":1893.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188633151},{"amount":701.75,"local_amount":1968.04,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T01:39:39Z","rounded_local_amount":1969.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191375776},{"amount":729.82,"local_amount":2046.75,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:20:41Z","rounded_local_amount":2048.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195793232},{"amount":758.99,"local_amount":2128.58,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T10:18:45Z","rounded_local_amount":2130.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201234987},{"amount":789.34,"local_amount":2213.67,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T10:17:26Z","rounded_local_amount":2215.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206101363},{"amount":820.35,"local_amount":2300.65,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T10:36:46Z","rounded_local_amount":2302.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211171796}],"funded_date":"2010-11-22T12:32:26Z","paid_date":"2011-06-15T10:36:46Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Oxnard","image":null}},{"id":254511,"name":"Mutangu","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mutangu is a 44 year-old man who is married to Mbula, who is a 40 year-old housewife.
