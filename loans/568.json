Thi Vu, 31 years old, has been participating in the Fund for 9 years.  Before joining the Fund she worked in the fields like many other women in the region.  In 1999, she started planning with her husband to join the Fund for seed money to go into business and improve their family\u2019s finances.  Everyday her husband uses the money borrowed to go buy baby pigs in town and surrounding areas to sell to retailers with freezers.  Mrs. Vu buys wheat from farmers and resell it to processors who grind the wheat.  In the first few funding rounds, since they were new to their respective businesses, the couple only borrowed a small amount.  After some time the couple became familiar with their businesses and bravely increased their loan amounts.  The businesses have increased the family\u2019s income day by day; currently the family\u2019s income ranges from 3,500,000 VND to 4,500,000 VND per month.  Thanks to this improvement the children are better off in their daily lives and their schooling.  Mrs. Vu would like to borrow 10,000,000 VND to buy more stock for her business without having to pay a high interest rate with credit.  \r\n<p><b>Translated from Vietnamese by Chi Nguyen, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\nCh\u1ecb V\u0169 Th\u1ecb Tuy\u1ebft n\u0103m nay 31 tu\u1ed5i v\u00e0 \u0111\u00e3 tham gia v\u00e0o Qu\u1ef9 T\u00ecnh th\u01b0\u01a1ng \u0111\u01b0\u1ee3c 9 n\u0103m.Tr\u01b0\u1edbc khi tham gia v\u00e0o Qu\u1ef9 t\u00ecnh th\u01b0\u01a1ng ch\u1ecb ch\u1ec9 l\u00e0m ru\u1ed9ng nh\u01b0 bao ng\u01b0\u1eddi ph\u1ee5 n\u1eef kh\u00e1c t\u1ea1i \u0111\u1ecba ph\u01b0\u01a1ng.

His wife is a merchant and she gets up in the mornings to prepare breakfast for her husband who has to get ready for work early as he works as a taxi driver and needs to check his car before leaving.  He has been in this business for fourteen years and the job can sometimes be tiring because the situation is bad and clients do not want to pay what the trips are worth.  However, there are good days.  He started his business by buying his car with his own funds.

Experienced and talented in the business, Nodira has expanded her business into a successful trade, supporting her family. Throughout the last four years, IMON International has provided ongoing assistance to Nodira\u2019s business through microfinance loans. Committed to growth and successful entrepreneurship, Nodira has used each loan wisely and has repaid each with a perfect credit history. Currently, she is seeking a loan of 4000 Somoni to purchase more clothing for selling. With the rotation of supplies in her business, she plans to repay the loan within 6 months. The well being of Nodira\u2019s family and her business are in your hands. Nodira and her children are sincerely grateful for your support.    <p>\r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International<p>\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and with its famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <p>\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <p>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<p>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She lives with her partner in a rented home.  She is the mother of a 3 year old girl, who is the motivation for her efforts. Her business is the purchase, care and sale of guinea pigs. The meat from her guinea pigs is in high demand at Sunday fairs because she feeds them well and ensures they grow to a good size.  To do this, she gets up very early each day to cut grass to feed them.  She prevents them from eating oats and alfalfa which is stored for months when there is drought.  Nelly cares for her little animals with a lot of love, as she knows that it is thanks to them that she brings in money to meet her needs.  \r\n\r\nThe two years she has spent in this business have taught her to care for her animals and keep them parasite free in order to offer healthy meat to all her customers.  In the future, Nelly hopes to increase the number of guinea pigs that she has, and to build appropriate cages for them.  She finds that the most difficult part of her work is to root out bad weeds in the grass that she uses to feed the animals, because if she doesn't the guinea pigs that eat them will die.  Nelly proudly shows us her guinea pigs in this photo.  \r\n\r\nThis is her fourth loan with MFP, and she is committed to making payments on the dates scheduled by her loan advisor.  The money that she is requesting will be used to have cages built for her many guinea pigs.  With this she will be able to select them according to size.  She will also purchase concentrated feed for the development and fattening up of her little animals.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michele Magrino, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":323696,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Purchase of feed and construction of cages ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-05-26T05:30:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":675,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nelly","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-05-06T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-02T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":675}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":675,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2009-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:29:41Z","rounded_local_amount":2028.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73641244}],"funded_date":"2009-05-26T10:06:07Z","paid_date":"2009-09-15T19:29:41Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Michele Magrino","image":387464}},{"id":114443,"name":"Huyen's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Huy\u1ec1n Th\u1ecb Nguy\u1ec5n was born in 1952 (no. 010102080014).

All of the children are in school. \r\n\r\nRichard has a bakery business that he inherited from his father 20 years ago. His market area is in the Ishaka suburbs,  with Mitooma secondary school and the University nearby. His main challenge has been the constant increase in price of the raw materials, such as flour and oil. He uses his motorcycle to supply the products to his customers and this makes his work a bit easier. \r\n\r\nHis kind of products include doughnuts, cookies, brown bread, pancakes, kebab and chapattis and luckily he has customers for all his products. Richard had a dream of opening up a store in the suburban town with a van to expand in the market, as well as have all his children educated up to the university level. He needs a loan to help with buying firewood and flour for baking purposes.

El dinero que ahora solicita lo piensa invertir en la compra de fertilizantes qu\u00edmicos para su pr\u00f3xima siembra."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":403790,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Compra de fertilizantes","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-10-11T22:50:19Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1050,"lender_count":36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosmery","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-10-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":1050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":3000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1050}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":680.92,"local_amount":1945.48,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:10:46Z","rounded_local_amount":1964.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118124031},{"amount":369.08,"local_amount":1054.52,"processed_date":"2010-07-08T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:36:26Z","rounded_local_amount":1064.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159672636}],"funded_date":"2009-10-18T01:41:58Z","paid_date":"2010-08-15T11:36:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":147318,"name":"Leang","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Leang M., a 47-year-old married woman with two children, lives with her family in Phnom Penh.

She is 45 years old, married, and has adult-aged children.\n\nRosemarie owns and operates a business venture into raising pigs for sale. During the selling season, she earns approximately 6,000 PHP a month.\n\nIn 2004, Rosemarie joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. She is requesting a new loan of 13,000 PHP which will be used to purchase pig feed and other supplies. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to financially support immediate members of her family. \n\n\nAbout ASKI:\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\n\n\n *Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":453372,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To

the Philippines. She earns her living by operating a general store.\r\n\r\nIrene\u2019s husband, Rodrigo B., is  61 years old and works as carpenter and welder, and earns about 5,000 PHP per month. They have four children, who are between 32 and 38 years old, and six grandchildren. Three of the children have their own families, but still help their parents with some of the household expenses. The remaining single child also works and helps with the household expenses.\r\n\r\nIrene joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2002, in the hopes that she would be able to help her husband improve their family's quality of life. With the help of her loans from NWTF-PD, she has been able to increase the family's income by operating a general store and fruit vending. Now, she earns an average monthly income of 4,000 PHP from her business activities.\r\n\r\nIrene is a member in good standing. Her previous loan of 16,000 PHP was used to fund operations of her general store, and it had a positive impact in both the business and the family\u2019s living conditions. Now she is borrowing for her 14th loan, the amount of 16,000 PHP, which she intends to use for her general store and fruit vending business. Irene is working hard to achieve her dreams and aspirations for her family, which is to provide them with a brighter future and a more comfortable life.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress out of earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":468675,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

She states that she decided to launch this business because her husband works in agriculture and does not have a steady income. Mar\u00eda del Carmen got in touch with a wholesaler who fills special orders depending on the season (they are currently making school uniform pants). He picks up the merchandise and sells it throughout the different areas of the country's mountainous region. <p>\r\nShe has also started her own small general store. She plans on using this business to help her family get ahead in life. This business has welcomed many customers and neighbors due to the fact that they live in a rural area that is far from town, so they do not have access to the products that they consume on a daily basis. Mar\u00eda del Carmen would like to expand this business, which is why she needs to request a 1,000.00 PEN loan from Edpyme Alternativa for the very first time. She will invest this money in purchasing goods for her general store. <p>\r\nShe is a well-known and respected person in her community. Her greatest wish is to keep making her general store grow so that she can continue supporting her family.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Elizabeth Casian, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":506800,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"Purchase goods for in-home general store","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Chepito - Morrope - Lambayeque","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":143,"posted_date":"2010-03-16T21:00:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Del Carmen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-02-26T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":71.94},{"due_date":"2010-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":71.1},{"due_date":"2010-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":74.4},{"due_date":"2010-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":74.25},{"due_date":"2010-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":80.73},{"due_date":"2010-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":81.12},{"due_date":"2010-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":83.23},{"due_date":"2010-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":87.61},{"due_date":"2010-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":89.52},{"due_date":"2010-12-27T08:00:00Z","amount":92.5},{"due_date":"2011-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":95.8},{"due_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":97.8}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.98},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.66},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.9},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.84},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.28},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.42},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.21},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.85},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.57},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.69},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.93},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":26.98,"local_amount":71.94,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T08:45:38Z","rounded_local_amount":75.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128934689},{"amount":26.66,"local_amount":71.1,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:09:12Z","rounded_local_amount":74.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136662313},{"amount":27.9,"local_amount":74.4,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:07:25Z","rounded_local_amount":78.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144695017},{"amount":27.84,"local_amount":74.25,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:38:40Z","rounded_local_amount":78.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151878062},{"amount":30.28,"local_amount":80.73,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T10:51:00Z","rounded_local_amount":85.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159618090},{"amount":30.42,"local_amount":81.12,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:02:03Z","rounded_local_amount":85.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166832492},{"amount":31.21,"local_amount":83.23,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T09:56:49Z","rounded_local_amount":87.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172099099},{"amount":66.42,"local_amount":177.13,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T13:46:14Z","rounded_local_amount":186.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182529986},{"amount":70.62,"local_amount":188.3,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T02:56:13Z","rounded_local_amount":198.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191409487},{"amount":36.67,"local_amount":97.8,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T08:32:19Z","rounded_local_amount":103.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":196107945}],"funded_date":"2010-03-17T00:09:37Z","paid_date":"2011-03-24T08:32:19Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Elizabeth Casian","image":845142}},{"id":189045,"name":"Salinah","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Salinah S., 45, is married to Benjamin Ossen who is 54yrs old and an employee of Kuda (Kerio Valley Development Authority).

She is 26 years old, married, and has one infant child. She is the group leader of a four-member group loan offered by PMPC. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is Nancy C. Group. \r\n\r\nTo make a living, she owns and operates a business providing motorcycle transportation to local community members. She has been engaged in her business for over three years and earns approximately $100 a month. \r\n\r\nIn 2008, Nancy joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 14,900 PHP from PMPC. Nancy is requesting a new loan of 14,900 PHP which will be used to repair a transport vehicle used in her business. This will be her fourth loan from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family.\r\n\r\nAbout PMPC: Paglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model. *Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":557126,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Motorcycle

She earns her living by operating two business ventures: fish vending and food vending. Her husband, Lemuel, who is 42 years old, works as a carpenter and also helps in his wife's business activities. They have six children who are 8 to 19 years old. Liza joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2007 because she aspired to something better for her family. With the help of her past six loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Liza has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 12000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 5,500, raising the family's standard of living. This time, for her seventh cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 14000, which she intends to use to as revolving capital for her fish-vending activities. She plans to continue to save for future home repairs and the education of her children. Liza D. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means \"honorable\"). Through the program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams.

She started the business five months ago.  Her husband\u2019s cousin invited her to join the catalogue shoe sales.  She has used profits to buy shoes to display.  They lend her a display case in a local pharmacy to display her products.\r\n\r\nHer business is important thanks to the profits it earns which she used primarily to buy more merchandise and to meet household expenses.  The part she likes best about her business is going out daily to offer her products and receive orders for footwear.  On average, she sees between 5-8 customers daily.  Her business faces challenges like the inclemency of the weather, especially when it rains besides facing competition from people in her community who are also into catalogue sales.\r\n\r\nShe uses profits from the business primarily to reinvest in more shoes.  Her short term goal is to add other items to her inventory like ladies\u2019 purses and blouses.  She hopes to accomplish this first with the loan and then with profits from the investment.\r\n\r\nHer business is very important to her because it will help her support her family economically as well as make improvements to her house in the future like installing a door, window frames, cement flooring and glass windows.\r\n\r\nShe would like to develop further in sales and grow professionally.  With respect to the loan, she feels happy because she will be able to invest more in her business.

is 38 years old and is a mother of 2 young boys that are still in school.  When she realized that her husband's income as a taxi driver was not covering the basic necessities of her home, she decided to support him, and started to prepare and sell ice cream.  In order to excel in this endeavor, she repurposed a space in her humble home and at first only catered to her neighbors using a small wheelbarrow that her husband built for her business.  Today, after having dedicated endless hours of work and much effort, she has obtained a small ice cream cart.  The small business she has built has also allowed her to offer employment to three young people in her city. <p>\r\n\r\nHer hopes are to better the quality and variety of the products she offers, with the purpose of increasing customer preference and satisfaction.  In order to fulfill this goal, she is asking for a loan of $500 that she will use to acquire a freezer to preserve the quality and taste of her delicious ice cream.

Consequentially, Mrs. T. decided to rent a place to start buying and selling wastes. Mrs. T. used the loan of the first round to invest in poultries, but she didn\u2019t make much profit. Learning the mistake, Mrs. T. since then has invested the loans from TYM in her business, from which she earns about 200000 VND per day. The business has aided her family financially a great deal. In the next round of loan, Mrs. T. would like to ask for 9.000.000 VND ($550) to expand her business. Her family\u2019s monthly income is about 6.000.000 VND. <p><br \/><p><strong>Translated from Vietnamese by Khoa Nguyen, Kiva

This is 35-year-old Mary S. from Mwanza. She is married with two children between the ages of 1 and 9 years old. Mary S. has been running a beauty salon since 1999.

She works at the business for 12 hours per day, 6 days per week, and is assisted by one employee. Mary currently earns about 200USD from her business.

Mary thanks you for your support!\r\n<p>\r\n<p>ABOUT SELFINA!\r\n<p>SELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through micro-leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro-leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":285270,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty Salon","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"To purchase weaving tools, long hair extensions, clothes, and shoes.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mwanza","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.516667 32.9","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-03-11T17:40:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mary","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-03-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-04-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:23:58Z","rounded_local_amount":104160,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027600},{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-05-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:13:32Z","rounded_local_amount":104160,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613601},{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-06-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:01:33Z","rounded_local_amount":104160,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010680},{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-07-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:38:14Z","rounded_local_amount":104160,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63232966},{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-08-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:52:16Z","rounded_local_amount":104160,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73664757}],"funded_date":"2009-03-11T19:49:19Z","paid_date":"2009-09-15T21:52:16Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Judy Naegeli","image":264373}},{"id":98075,"name":"Tenning","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Madame Tenning  D. est une vendeuse ambulent de bissap et du mil ; elle habite \u00e0 Bambey dans la r\u00e9gion de Diourbel ; elle est mari\u00e9e et a 6 ans d\u2019exp\u00e9rience sur le m\u00e9tier.

She helps them pay their electricity, water and grocery bills, which leaves her with little left over for university. Janina wants very much to finish her studies and improve her future, so she started working in a market frequented by Nicaraguans, where products are cheap and plentiful. Thankfully she found a new job with better pay, and she has been working there for two years. Now that she has a better income, Janina wants to build her own room so that she can have more privacy. She needs credit for building materials like stone, sand, cement, iron and zinc. This loan will allow her to begin her project and finish it gradually. Janina says she is studying English because language opens doors that will allow her to improve her station in life, earn a better living, and help her parents so that they'll want for nothing. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Corinne Gilroy, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":424150,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":null,"use":"Building materials (stone, cement, sand, iron)","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Managua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.150833 -86.268333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":98,"posted_date":"2009-11-11T05:00:14Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Janina De Los Angeles","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-10-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":8000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":888.89},{"due_date":"2010-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":888.89},{"due_date":"2010-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":888.89},{"due_date":"2010-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":888.89},{"due_date":"2010-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":888.89},{"due_date":"2010-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":888.89},{"due_date":"2010-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":888.89},{"due_date":"2010-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":888.89},{"due_date":"2010-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":888.88}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.44},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.45},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.44},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.45},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.44},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.45},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.44},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.45},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.44}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":50.75,"local_amount":1014.99,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T10:58:43Z","rounded_local_amount":1050.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110601757},{"amount":52.22,"local_amount":1044.41,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T09:52:05Z","rounded_local_amount":1080.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118003200},{"amount":57.21,"local_amount":1144.24,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T07:53:18Z","rounded_local_amount":1184.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123841357},{"amount":56.54,"local_amount":1130.71,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T07:49:54Z","rounded_local_amount":1170.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128874271},{"amount":35.14,"local_amount":702.86,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T09:30:22Z","rounded_local_amount":727.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136604170},{"amount":37.34,"local_amount":746.73,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T08:31:22Z","rounded_local_amount":772.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144639634},{"amount":37.39,"local_amount":747.86,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:00:55Z","rounded_local_amount":773.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151821408},{"amount":47.83,"local_amount":956.63,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T09:03:31Z","rounded_local_amount":989.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159561422},{"amount":25.58,"local_amount":511.57,"processed_date":"2010-08-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T09:17:09Z","rounded_local_amount":529.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166770381}],"funded_date":"2009-11-12T00:37:35Z","paid_date":"2010-09-15T09:17:09Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":155610,"name":"Vedith","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"              La se\u00f1ora Vedith, pertenece al Banco Comunal \u201cSargento Lores\u201d, Distrito de Morales, Provincia de San Martin, Departamento de San Mart\u00edn.

He learned to farm when he was a boy and now raises mainly potatoes and corn.  His wife and children help him and periodically check the crops to make sure that they are free of insects and disease.  When the requirement for labor increases, he hires additional field hands.\r\n\r\nHe tells us that he enjoys working in the fields very much, because he does it independently and with no pressure.  Even though it\u2019s hard work, it\u2019s rewarded when he sells his harvest.  This is why he wants to acquire more land and increase his number of animals.\r\n\r\nThis will be his first loan through MFP and he\u2019s very happy to know that he has financial backing.

Guisselle has a business producing handmade woven garments including sweaters, toques, gloves, scarves, socks, etc. She also offers decorating services for special events such as birthdays, communions, and work parties. Her main source of revenue is her garment business, but she involves herself with both activities in order to maintain a steady stream of income. Guisselle has been working in this capacity for the past eight years.  Her revenue generating activities have helped her to provide for her children.\r\n\r\nThis will be Guisselle's first loan with Fundaci\u00f3n Mujer. Guisselle decided to apply for a loan after completing a capacity building course in business administration at the Foundation.  With this loan, Guisselle plans to make investments in both of her productive activities. Specifically, she plans to buy different colors of high quality wool and make repairs to her weaving machine by replacing the cones.  She also plans to use the loan to purchase balloons and party decorations. Currently Guiselle has pending orders in both of her activities.  She lacks sufficient working capital in order to make investments, which would enable her to satisfy the demands of her clients. This loan will help to address this obstacle. \r\n\r\nWith two children and a home to take care of, Guisselle is busy most days until 3 PM. She dedicates the hours between 3 and 6 to weaving. If necessary, she will weave after dinner until 11 PM.  When she provides party decoration services, her husband assists her.  Guisselle\u00b4s long-term goal is to fulfill her business plan, which includes generating sufficient revenues from her productive activities in order to open a weaving workshop and a gift shop. As mentioned, the main factor inhibiting the growth of her business is a lack of access to working capital. Guisselle plans to use this loan to make bulk purchases of quality raw materials, which will ensure a better price from her suppliers and lower her overall costs of production.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":656799,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Weaving","sector":"Arts","themes":["Underfunded

R. lives in the Moyotepec community in the city of Ayala in the state of Morelos, Mexico.  She is 42 years old, and she has an elementary school education.  She will use the loan to increase the inventory in her business.  She started her business two years ago in her sister\u2019s house.  There is a soccer field in the Abelardo neighborhood, and the players asked if she sold water or soft drinks.  \r\n\r\nShe then decided to make a small investment to establish a stand, and she started to sell water and soft drinks.  Her sister lent her the space that she currently uses.  It is on the side of the soccer field in the Abelardo neighborhood.  She opens it on Saturdays and Sundays.  Sometimes her sister\u2019s children help her take care of the business during the week. \r\n\r\n Before she sold food she sold shoes by catalog.  She did not like this business activity very much because she had to walk a lot, and in her new business she is not as tired.  She is going to use the loan to buy soft drinks, bottles of water, snacks, juice, and sweets.  She sells these the most.  It takes her ten minutes using public transportation to get to her business.\r\n\r\nShe feels that her business is very important because her work gives her enough income for her living expenses.  In addition, it gives her great satisfaction to run her own business.  Also, through her business she knows a lot of people, and they all treat her respectfully.\r\n\r\nIn her business she primarily waits on the players, their families, and the fans that go to the games.  One of the challenges that her business faces is the growing competition, which has caused her sales to drop.  She uses the income from her business to invest in more products for her business.  She also pays for the utilities at her business and her home.\r\n\r\nShe plans to buy different products than the ones she sells in order to have more variety in her business.  Her future plans are to set up her business like a grocery store and to increase the number of customers she has.\r\n\r\nTomasa is married, and her husband is a bricklayer.  They have three daughters.  Rub\u00ed is 17 years old, Yesica is 22 years old, and Jazm\u00edn is 20 years old.  As two of her daughters are married, they keep house and are not able to help in her business.  Her youngest daughter goes to school.  Sometimes her nephew helps her take care of the business during the week.  On Saturday and Sunday she personally takes care of the customers.  \r\n\r\nMoyotepec is a peaceful village with fields.\r\n\r\nTomasa wants to say thanks to Kiva and to the Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad, \u201cI am grateful to those who are able to help us improve our businesses with this loan.\u201d\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":684261,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To buy soft drinks like Coca-Cola, Pepsi, Jarrito, Squirt, Mirinda, and bottles of  purified water and sweets","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Moyotepec, Ayala, Morelos","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2011-01-04T19:30:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":650,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Tomasa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-12-16T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":8000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2011-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2011-01-27T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2011-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2011-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2011-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2011-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2011-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":243.75,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T03:45:03Z","rounded_local_amount":3015.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191430797},{"amount":162.5,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:44:46Z","rounded_local_amount":2010.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195850055},{"amount":162.5,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:10:10Z","rounded_local_amount":2010.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201292328},{"amount":81.25,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:08:51Z","rounded_local_amount":1005.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206160593}],"funded_date":"2011-01-05T00:12:36Z","paid_date":"2011-05-15T11:08:51Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ginny Kalish"}},{"id":266912,"name":"Obdulia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Obdulia tiene  40 a\u00f1os, vive con su  esposo y 4 hijos en su propia casa.

This is 31-year-old Mary Miyaniko from Mwanza. She is married and has two children between the ages of 10 and 12. Mary has been running a tailoring business since 2006. She purchases vitambaa (material), vitenge (a traditional Tanzanian cloth with wax print), and kanga (printed cotton fabric often with a border along all four sides), and makes them into clothing, mainly for women. She works at the business for 12 hours per day, six days per week, and is assisted by one employee. Mary currently earns about $120 from her business. She is requesting a loan of $400 in order to buy vitambaa, vitenge, and kanga. In the future, she plans to add more material to make more clothing for sale. Mary thanks you for your support!\r\n<p>\r\nAbout SELFINA\r\n<p>\r\nSELFINA has taken a leading role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through micro-leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets: thus, they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro-leasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thereby enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":285313,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Tailoring","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"To buy materials to make and sell traditional African clothing.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mwanza","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.516667 32.9","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-03-09T22:50:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mary","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-03-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-04-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:23:57Z","rounded_local_amount":52080,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027606},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-05-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:13:33Z","rounded_local_amount":52080,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613607},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-06-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:01:34Z","rounded_local_amount":52080,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010686},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-07-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:38:15Z","rounded_local_amount":52080,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63232972},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-08-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:52:17Z","rounded_local_amount":52080,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73664763},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-09-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T02:45:37Z","rounded_local_amount":52080,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87105477},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-10-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T06:26:33Z","rounded_local_amount":52080,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97022622},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-11-18T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:41:37Z","rounded_local_amount":52080,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103867871},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-12-18T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T16:44:31Z","rounded_local_amount":52080,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110757072},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-01-17T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:34:27Z","rounded_local_amount":52080,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118146184}],"funded_date":"2009-03-10T01:21:59Z","paid_date":"2010-02-15T12:34:27Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Maeve","image":1271729}},{"id":98091,"name":"Afoua","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Cette dame est une r\u00e9sidente du quartier d\u2019ago\u00e8 assiy\u00e9y\u00e9 au nord de la ville de Lom\u00e9, elle est mari\u00e9e et 02 enfants, son mari est un enseignant \u00e0 la retraite.

Currently, she operates out of her house selling many things, such as women\u2019s clothing, cooking equipment, and baked goods. Through Esperanza\u2019s ambition she organized four other local women from the community into a group in order to approach Esperanza for a loan.\r\n\r\nEsperanza is a single mother raising three children. She has two boys, aged thirteen and eight, and one 3 year old daughter. When talking to Esperanza, it was very clear that her family is the number one priority for her, and she would do anything to make sure they were happy. Currently, the two boys are in school and they are doing well, and she would love nothing more than for them to attend college in the future. The three year old daughter is a handful, but is always smiling.\r\n\r\nObtaining a loan is what Esperanza needs in order to expand her business. Along with the ability to expand her inventory, she would like to purchase a cart with which she could travel around her village to sell her goods. In order to sell now, she has to stay in her house, but with a cart it will open up a whole new market of potential customers. The opportunity for obtaining a loan is a very rare opportunity for these women, and all members of the group, not only Esperanza, stressed their intentions to work very hard in order to pay the loan back in the allotted time.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":850,"image":{"id":343753,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing

Felicidad is just starting this business.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Felicidad joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Felicidad has successfully repaid a previous loan of 4,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Felicidad is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP, which will be used for the expansion of her store. This loan will be the fourth loan taken out by Felicidad from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She separated from the man who was her husband many years ago. She has two daughters, 20 and 16, who are students and who are the reason she is working: to give them a good education. They live together in their own house where they also share their days with their cousins. \r\n\r\nMaria\u2019s work involves the sale of beauty products. She sells items like personal care and facial care products, colognes, perfumes, clothing and more and she does her work from her home. When she started this work approximately 6 years ago, it was complicated for her to do since she did not know the business very well. However, with time she was able to get ahead and become a successful saleswoman. What she enjoys about her work is having time to do all the things she wants to do, as well as care for her daughters who are students and are at an age when they need so many things. Things are going well since she has two incomes, one from the sale of cosmetics and the other as a health worker in a hospital in her city.\r\n\r\nMaria has many plans for the future but what she wants to do now is to continue expanding her merchandise. This will be her second loan with MFP. She is very pleased to know that she will have financial support for in this way she will feel more certain of advancing in her work. As well, she promises once again to meet her payments on time, as she has on earlier loans. With the sum requested, 1000 soles, she will purchase beauty products to have in stock so that she will be able to offer a greater variety of goods to her customers.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":954161,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy more beauty products.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-12-22T00:50:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-11-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":151.02},{"due_date":"2012-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":159.36},{"due_date":"2012-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":158.75},{"due_date":"2012-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":171.22},{"due_date":"2012-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":177.6},{"due_date":"2012-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":182.05}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.63},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.76},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.53},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.21},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.6},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.27}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":56.63,"local_amount":151.02,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:51:34Z","rounded_local_amount":152.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250836365},{"amount":59.76,"local_amount":159.36,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:18:52Z","rounded_local_amount":161.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257246150},{"amount":59.53,"local_amount":158.75,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:32:24Z","rounded_local_amount":160.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263386166},{"amount":130.81,"local_amount":348.82,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T10:29:11Z","rounded_local_amount":352.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276713407},{"amount":68.27,"local_amount":182.05,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:28:24Z","rounded_local_amount":184.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283202295}],"funded_date":"2011-12-29T13:25:06Z","paid_date":"2012-06-15T18:28:24Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Diane Chaney","image":825872}},{"id":377604,"name":"Helene","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"\nCliente de 62 ans, elle est veuve et a 7 enfants plus et grand m\u00e8re de 5 petits enfants ,A la mort de son mari pour subvenir aux besoins de des enfants ,elle se lance dans la vente des vivres frais au marche.\n\nQuand elle commence a Hope, elle vendait ses vivres frais sur un \u00e9talage,et depuis qu'elle a b\u00e9n\u00e9ficie de pr\u00eats de Hope, son activite a grandi, elle ne vend plus sur les \u00e9talages, a l'heure actuelle elle loue une chambre froide et elle achete en gros.\nLes differents pr\u00eats ont fait eu de l'impact dans sa vie sociale et \u00e9conomique et familiale ,elle \u00e9pargne constamment et fait ses remboursements sans difficult\u00e9s et avec ses benefices elle prend soin de sa famille et elle assure la scolarit\u00e9 de ses petits enfants.\n\nElle a pour ambition de continuer d'aller vers l'avant et \u00eatre une grossiste renomm\u00e9e des vivres frais.   \n\n  ","en":"Helene is a 62 year old client.

She has been very productive in the businesses she has started. Her former husband cares for two of her five children, and three of the children are in her care. \r\n<p>\r\nThis, her latest venture, is a general convenience store. She says that most of her sales are derived from the sale of rum and beer, together with rice. I mentioned that this was the same combination of goods that other merchants were requesting a loan for to sell in the same community. I asked why many women would be stocking the same products to increase sales capability, as opposed to having a different strategy. Balbina mentioned that there are quite a few general stores in the area, but that they all have good businesses.  Each and everyone has their customer base already built up, and are sufficiently patronized to bring in a reasonable level of business activity.

Now Mrs.S. requests the loan of 1700 STJ to expand her assortment (she also wants to purchase layettes because it is one of the high-turnover products)."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":118215,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"To increase her  assortment of goods","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Nau","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"38.266667 72.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":47,"posted_date":"2008-01-27T15:10:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":500,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Anor","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-02-11T22:00:18Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":1700,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":283.33},{"due_date":"2008-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":283.33},{"due_date":"2008-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":283.33},{"due_date":"2008-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":283.33},{"due_date":"2008-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":283.33},{"due_date":"2008-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":283.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2008-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":83.35}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":84,"local_amount":285.6,"processed_date":"2008-02-28T10:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-07-28T09:29:45Z","rounded_local_amount":291.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":143723},{"amount":84,"local_amount":285.6,"processed_date":"2008-03-28T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-07-28T09:29:45Z","rounded_local_amount":291.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":167829},{"amount":84,"local_amount":285.6,"processed_date":"2008-04-28T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-07-28T09:29:45Z","rounded_local_amount":291.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":193710},{"amount":84,"local_amount":285.6,"processed_date":"2008-05-28T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-07-28T09:29:45Z","rounded_local_amount":291.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221650},{"amount":84,"local_amount":285.6,"processed_date":"2008-06-28T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-07-28T09:29:45Z","rounded_local_amount":291.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250831},{"amount":80,"local_amount":272,"processed_date":"2008-07-28T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-07-28T09:29:45Z","rounded_local_amount":277.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":279508}],"funded_date":"2008-01-28T22:00:18Z","paid_date":"2008-07-28T09:03:49Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":36644,"name":"Yawa","description":{"languages":["fr"],"texts":{"fr":"Yawa G. is 33 years old, single, and the mother of two children.

This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":403961,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To purchase shop items in bulk ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbozi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.75 32.75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-10-12T04:50:18Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Frida  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-10-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":400000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2009-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2010-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2010-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2010-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":66666.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.16},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.16},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":54.17,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:44:28Z","rounded_local_amount":71120.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103868361},{"amount":54.16,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2009-12-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T16:46:44Z","rounded_local_amount":71120.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110757557},{"amount":54.17,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2010-01-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:34:44Z","rounded_local_amount":71120.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118146651},{"amount":54.17,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T11:16:15Z","rounded_local_amount":71120.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123984796},{"amount":54.16,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2010-03-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-10T13:02:16Z","rounded_local_amount":71120.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":129015469},{"amount":54.17,"local_amount":66666.65,"processed_date":"2010-04-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-10T13:02:54Z","rounded_local_amount":71120.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136740475}],"funded_date":"2009-10-18T01:11:13Z","paid_date":"2010-12-10T13:02:54Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":147366,"name":"Agnes","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Agnes is 61 years old and a widow with four children.

Magielyn repaid her previous loan of 20,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase raw materials to make additional furniture. Magielyn is requesting a new loan of 20000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional raw materials to expand product offerings. This loan will be the seventh loan taken out by Magielyn from ASKI.

For 10 years, Esther has been a mixed-farmer. She keeps dairy cattle and poultry on her farm. She also grows maize, among other crops. Despite prevailing animal diseases, she finds dairy farming to be the most enjoyable commercial farming activity. Besides dairy farming, she has a deep connection with gardening. In African communities, gardening is the most popular, yet the least exclusive, hobby for women. You really don't have to be born with a green thumb to give life to a glorious garden. Any woman with a homestead and a few square feet of earth is doing her best to make her little corner of the world more gracious and beautiful. Esther, however, is taking this a little step further. Esther is seeking a loan to start horticultural farming. This is a big deal for her. She is very excited to start growing different varieties of crops for commercial purposes. The demand for vegetables and other greens is always high. Income from this venture will cover the high farming expenses she has to deal with currently.

They are currently living in her mother-in-law\u2019s house. Since she began living at her mother-in-law\u2019s home she dedicates herself to taking her cows to pasture, but there are also days that she works on the small farm with her husband, on those days she wakes up early to cook lunch and takes it into the fields. On her way she also takes the animals and ties them to places where there is a lot of pasture for them to eat. Miriam and her husband have taken this opportunity to plant peas on rented small plots of land that charge them for each cultivated crop. The good thing is that they are plots of land with good road access, and when she walks from her home to the fields she can do it in only half an hour. She is happy with her work, be it working on the small farm or putting the animals to pasture, the only difficulty is that it when it rains a great deal because she carries her baby on her back she has to cover him very well, given that once he got wet and caught a cold. As such when it rains hard she gets a hold of him and returns home. This is the 4th loan that Miriam has with the MFP bank, and in all this time she has attended all the meetings that the loan adviser carries out. Especially when it comes to payments, she always makes them on the assigned days and has never had a delinquent payment. Miriam will invest the loan requested in the purchase of 3 sacks of pea seeds, which she will plant this season with the hope of having a good crop yield in the month of May.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Mariela Cedeno, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":261604,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Purchase of pea seeds.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-01-26T23:50:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Miriam","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1300,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1300}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":425}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":425,"local_amount":1300,"processed_date":"2009-07-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:42:48Z","rounded_local_amount":1353.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63210859}],"funded_date":"2009-01-27T00:07:01Z","paid_date":"2009-08-15T16:42:48Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Mariela Cede\u00f1o","image":883126}},{"id":89931,"name":"Abiba","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Abiba I. is sixty five years old.

She was born in Camarines Sur, Bicol, a province down south of Luzon. Today, she lives with her husband and family in Pasay, Metro Manila. Blessed with five children, she and her husband Rolando are teaming up to expand their business for their family. Arlene has been a regular member of Center for Community Transformation* (CCT) for more than two years now. She regularly attends their weekly fellowship meetings and pays her weekly dues consistently. Because of her good repayment performance with her previous loans, she was able to borrow seven times in CCT\u2019s Cooperative. The reason why she was consistent in paying her loans was because she used almost all of the money she borrowed to buy assorted vegetables for her business.\r\n\r\nNow with your help, she would like to apply for a PHP 48,000 loan. This amount will be used to expand her business with additional assorted vegetables, meat, and fish.\r\n\r\nShe dreams that her business will continue to grow so that when the time comes, they can have the resources to buy a lot or a market space where they can put up their own vegetable\/meat store.  \r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":453502,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits &

Her group is located in the rural areas surrounding El-Seibo, a rural town where the economy is dominated by agriculture and where running water (none of which is potable) and electricity are unreliable. She makes her home here in a simple structure with her long term partner and their two children.\r\n\r\nMaritza is excited to be taking her third loan with Esperanza after having successfully repaid her previous loans and grown her business.

Cusco is a city that is known for its archaeological sites, its historic city center, its scenery and its history; it is an enchanting city in the southern region of the country.\r\n\r\nThe members are involved in a variety of commercial activities.  Among these are: sale of food, prepared meals, crafts, jora (alcoholic beverage maD. from fermented corn), pasturage, vegetables, small farm animals, dairy products, grains; others care for senior citizens, work as hotel housekeepers and as secretaries.\r\n\r\nThe communal bank has undergone several cycles and, as the members state, they are happy and satisfied with the credit services, the savings, and the training.  They especially appreciate the accrued value that they can obtain by leaving their funds in a common account.\r\n\r\nIsabel is a member of the \u201cSe\u00f1or D. los Milagros D. Chimpahuaylla\u201d communal bank.  She lives with her life partner and has 6 children.  Isabel is a hard-working, enterprising woman who devised a way to open her own business: she sells chicha (chicha D. jora is an ancestral Peruvian and American beverage maD. from jora, fermented corn).  She has her own store, called Picanter\u00eda, located in Cusco\u2019s San Jer\u00f3nimo neighborhood\u2019s main square.  Picanter\u00eda is unique among the other businesses because a red flag is tied to a plant at the entrance. \r\n\r\nIsabel tells us how she does her work: she rises very early to prepare the chicha D. jora and then begins her sales around noon.  Starting at three in the afternoon, she provides a free snack, called \u201cpicante\u201d to her customers.  She is open for business until 10pm.  When she completes her work day, she goes home to rest in order to start all over the next day.  She has been in this line of work for 16 years and has done well thanks to the efforts she puts into her work. \r\n\r\nShe needs funding to buy firewood, jora and beer.\r\n\r\nThe group members, as a whole, are grateful for the opportunity offered and pledge to repay in a timely fashion.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4400,"image":{"id":503602,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Catering","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"      To buy firewood, jora (alcoholic beverage made from fermented corn) and beer.

businesswoman. The challenges she went through have not stopped her from improving her family's lifestyle and giving her four children a better future. Though her husband is in prison, she has not surrendered to life and accepted poverty. Instead she has gone beyond the very few opportunities offered by her poor life and there she found ASHI. \r\n\r\nIt was in the year 2000 when Erlinda first received a loan through ASHI. She started a small \u201csari-sari\u201d (convenience) store selling a small inventory of grocery items, foodstuffs, and beverages. As the years went on, the amounts of her loans have increased and helped her sustain and expand her business. The profits she occasionally makes from her business are such a great help for her to support the needs of her children, whose ages range from 10 to 18. She also supports the needs of her husband in prison. \r\n\r\nErlinda is happy for having achieved her business. However, she still needs to have other sources of income for a back up in case her store has problems and her family needs a larger amount of financial assistance, especially for the children's education. Erlinda is requesting a larger amount to borrow to enable her to finance a transportation service which will be managed by a hired driver.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is married and has 5 children. Her two oldest children live in Swaziland with their father and are attending university and the three smaller children live with her and go to school in Boane. Teresa studied until 5th grade and stopped due to her family\u2019s difficult financial situation. She moved with her family to Boane, a village 30Km away from the capital city Maputo, a long time ago. Teresa has had a small stand in front of her house since 1983, at which she sells ice creams, soft drinks and basic needs products. \r\n<p>\r\nAs her stand's business is quite unstable, she decided to start rearing chickens 3 years ago and has been successful so far. Teresa built a quite large henhouse in her backyard, where she now raises 1,000 chicks at a time. She buys the chicks and chicken feed in Maputo and pays someone to bring them to her house. After a 30-day maturity period Teresa sells each chicken for MTn 85. Clients normally go to her henhouse directly to buy chickens, but she sometimes transports them to the village center as well. Teresa counts on the help of her older daughter to run the stand, and they make between MTn 500 to MTn 1,000 per day. Teresa\u2019s husband is a policeman and also helps with the house\u2019s expenses and with the children\u2019s school fees.\r\n<p>\r\nThis will be Teresa\u2019s first loan with Hluvuku and Kiva. She will use the MTn 20,000 to buy chickens, chicken feed and vaccines in large quantity to stock. She heard about Hluvuku and decided to ask for this loan, as she wants to improve her business. In future Teresa would like to build a new general store to sell food and other products."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":850,"image":{"id":161525,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Buy
