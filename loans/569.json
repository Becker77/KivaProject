Occidental. She earns her living by operating an auto repair shop.\r\n\r\nElenita\u2019s husband, Elmer, is also 51.  He manages a junk shop business.  Together they have 4 children aged between 10 and 23.  Three of the children go to school and also help their parents in the business as part of their daily chores.  The oldest is currently working.\r\n\r\nElenita joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1990 in the hope that she would be able to help her husband improve the quality of life of their family. With the help of her loans from NWTF-PD she has been able to increase their family income by operating the auto repair business. Now she earns an average monthly income of Php 10,000 from her business activities.\r\n\r\nElenita is a member of good standing. Her previous loan of Php 17,000 was used to fund operations of her auto repair shop business. It had a positive impact on both the business and the family\u2019s living conditions. Now she is borrowing her 20th loan of Php 17,000, which she intends to use on the junk shop business. Elenita is working hard to achieve her dreams and aspirations for her family, which is to provide them with a brighter future and a more comfortable life.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress out of earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":489342,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Auto

She has been managing her variety store while also selling halo-halo (native Filipino dessert, made up of shaved ice, sweetened milk, a variety of sweet beans, shredded coconut, palm nuts, topped with sweetened jackfruit and caramel flan) peanut butter and charcoal. Her main customers are her neighbors who still are using the old ways of cooking.\r\n\r\nOfelia has been a regular member of Center for Community Transformation* (CCT) for more than a year now. She regularly attends weekly fellowship meetings and pays her weekly dues consistently. Because of her good repayment performance with her previous loans, she was able to borrow quite a few times in CCT\u2019s Cooperative.  She is consistent in paying her dues because she uses the money she borrows to expand and improve her businesses.     \r\n\r\nTo ensure the success of her business, she would like to apply for a PHP 18,000 loan. This amount will be used as a source of added capital to her expanding business by buying raw ingredients needed to continue production of her peanut butter. She also will invest some of the loan into her other businesses as additional capital to maintain operations of her store and her halo-halo stall.\r\n\r\nShe dreams that her business will continue to grow and be a stable source of income for her and her family.\r\n\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility.

This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.

She is 35 years old and lives with her 3 children: Yeni, 17; Denis, 14; and Victor, 13.  They live in a house that she inherited from her parents and what she most wants in the world is to give her children a decent life.  Agripina has worked hard all her life to get ahead.  At a young age, she started selling clothes, work that provides the money necessary to live.  She now has a space on the Explanada Laguna Temporal (where the market fairs are held in Juliaca).  She's a cheerful saleswoman and always meets potential buyers with a smile on her face.  Agripina enjoys selling clothing and always convinces her customers to walk away with some article of clothing or other.  Her greatest wish is to own a store where she can better tend to her customers and sell her merchandise more easily.  She's operated the business for 8 years and the most difficult thing for her is having to stay in one place all day without being able to venture out.  She wants to see her children take up professional careers and she's ready to work hard to make that happen.  This is Agripina's sixth MFP loan.  She has been very punctual in repaying past loans and expects to be so now, too.  She is very active in her community bank and is well-regarded by the other members.

One of her children works and the other two are minors.  Together, with a lot of effort, they try to get ahead.  She has always thought of providing the best for her children, and for this reason when she was left alone she did not hesitate to start to work the best way that she could, which was to cook.  For the last 5 years she has been selling a variety of fast food dishes such as salchipapas (hot dog with fried potatoes) and papas rellenas (fried potato with ground meat filling), that are sought after because they are delicious and cheap.  Her working day begins at 4 in the afternoon when she puts a table with benches in an area outside her house, and her working hours usually extend until midnight when there is no food left to offer.  She is very pleased, because since her children help her to serve the customers she gets considerable daily earnings that allow her to get ahead.  In addition, as she is a very enterprising woman, she plans in the future to set up a grocery store in her house because she wants to have a business that is more stable and tranquil.  This is the 5th loan that she has taken with MFP, and she pledges to make her payments on time, since she does not want to disappoint the people who have made this loan possible which will allow her to continue to work and make progress.  Marcela will use the loan she requests to buy ingredients that she needs at wholesale, such as rice, cooking oil, and sugar, so that she can offer a variety of dishes to her customers.  In this way she hopes to improve her earnings.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":618255,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy ingredients and products so that she can continue to prepare her dishes","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-10-16T17:20:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":200,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marcela ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-09-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":74.65},{"due_date":"2010-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":76.71},{"due_date":"2010-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":81.99},{"due_date":"2011-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":84.74},{"due_date":"2011-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":88.69},{"due_date":"2011-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":93.22}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.86},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.68},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.8},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.9},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.47},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.29}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":29.86,"local_amount":74.65,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T15:14:48Z","rounded_local_amount":83.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177450027},{"amount":30.68,"local_amount":76.71,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:01:49Z","rounded_local_amount":85.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182588725},{"amount":32.8,"local_amount":81.99,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T14:03:54Z","rounded_local_amount":91.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188725227},{"amount":33.9,"local_amount":84.74,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T04:40:02Z","rounded_local_amount":94.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191463320},{"amount":36.58,"local_amount":91.44,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T08:51:40Z","rounded_local_amount":102.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195886720},{"amount":36.18,"local_amount":90.47,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:37:26Z","rounded_local_amount":101.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201327066}],"funded_date":"2010-10-16T19:45:42Z","paid_date":"2011-04-15T11:37:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lisa Grobar","image":264298}},{"id":242797,"name":"Sughran's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sughran (who we see here holding a blue book) is a housewife who is always ready to help her husband, who makes a living selling fruits.

Najmidin lives in Istaravshan, Tajikistan. He is 48 years old, married and has five children. Najmidin is the sole provider for his family and earns his living by raising and selling cows at the local market. Once every 2-3 months he purchases young animals from local villagers, raises them over an 8-9 month period and later sells the adult cows to local butchers. Today, Najmidin is thinking about expanding his business, as his current earnings are not enough to provide for his family. He plans to purchase young cattle. That\u2019s why he is requesting a loan of 7,000 Somoni. \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International:\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Su mayor dificultad es no tener una caseta y por esa raz\u00f3n las autoridades de la escuela en ocasiones no la dejan vender. Ella solicita el pr\u00e9stamo para comprar verduras, harina, aceite, galletas, refrescos, dulces, etc. Con el apoyo de este pr\u00e9stamo podr\u00e1 mantener su negocio bien surtido y as\u00ed sus clientes preferir\u00e1n comprarle a ella.

","en":"Yesy Yolani is a member of the  Mi Esperanza (\"My Hope\") Solidarity Group. She is 38 years old, married, and her husband is a brick layer. She has an 8 year old son who depends on them and another daughter, who is independent. \r\n\r\nYesy has sold all types of candies since she was eight years old. Her business is located in the Jos\u00e9 Antonio Dom\u00ednguez School and even though she doesn't have a stand there she makes the candies at home and brings them to the school where she sets up a little table near the sports stadium and sells them to the students during recess. Her major concern is not having a stand and that therefore the school officials sometimes don't let her sell there. \r\n\r\nShe is requesting this loan in order to buy vegetables, flour, oil, cookies, soft drinks, sweets, etc... With the support of this loan she will be able to keep her business well stocked so that her customers will prefer to give their business to her. Her goal is to find a stand and be able to serve the students without any problem. Yesy has had three loans with this field partner and has not had any late payments. Thanks to these loans her business has improved and she has been able to support her son in his studies. Her group partners work in a variety of areas, including the sale of used clothes, hardware, plastics, and soy.

Her family resides near the market, so it is very convenient for retail business. In addition to rice farming, she and her husband also has a grocery store. In 2007, she was able to borrow from the fund and invested in their grocery store by buying additional products to sell. Before joining the fund, their income was only about 73 USD per month. Now their income has risen to 122 USD per month. For this next loan, she wishes to borrow 550 USD to invest in her grocery store\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Vietnamese by Thu Ostrander, Kiva

In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She owns a business venture, selling pancakes (fried flour pancakes flavored with lemon or coconut jam).  Seutaatia has 1 year of experience in this business.  Seutaatia needs a loan of WST $1000 to buy flour, flavoring, sugar, and plastic bags.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 300 talas or US $125 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Seutaatia joined SPBD.    This is her 1st loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Seutaatia's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.  Seutaatia joined the program to assist her business development.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Seutaatia F. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.6 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              2 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         2 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress.  The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation.  A higher number represents a higher score.  For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.  \r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.  \r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

Of his five children only one is dependent on him, a son who is in high school. Constancio makes a living growing potatoes on his 3 hectares of land in Kuri Mayu, a rural community 62 kilometers away from the city, so it is very difficult to be approved for a loan from a bank. Kiva partner Cidre took the initiative of going to this rural area. Constancio tells us that his wife died in a traffic accident while she was returning from the Colomi flea market after selling her products there. What Constancio wants is for his youngest son to finish his studies and become a professional like an agronomy technician so he can work and earn a good income so he can provide and care for him when he becomes an old man so he doesn't suffer. With the loan, he plans to plant more potatoes so he can be able to save money for his son's education.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Marty Greenstein, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":583100,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Purchase potato seeds and other supplies necessary for planting it","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"Cochabamba","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-17.383333 -66.15","type":"point"}},"partner_id":140,"posted_date":"2010-08-14T02:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":700,"lender_count":26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Constancio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-07-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":700,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":233.33},{"due_date":"2011-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":233.33},{"due_date":"2012-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":233.34}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":233.33},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":233.33},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":233.34}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":200,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:33:09Z","rounded_local_amount":200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195819595},{"amount":300,"local_amount":300,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T10:37:56Z","rounded_local_amount":300,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206129220},{"amount":200,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-17T08:54:36Z","rounded_local_amount":200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257540063}],"funded_date":"2010-08-16T12:08:19Z","paid_date":"2012-02-17T08:54:36Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Marty Greenstein","image":null}},{"id":226416,"name":"Willis","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Willis is a veteran electrician, having worked in this trade for the past forty years. He remembers one of his first projects as an electrician: on stage for jazz pianist Herbie Hancock. \"He was using a lot of synthesizers and microphones, so it wasn't an easy job.\" Willis keeps a photo of Mr. Hancock hanging in his office in Oakland, California.\r\n \r\nIn 2007, after working as a union electrician with large companies for 34 years, Willis decided to open his own business: Special Electric Construction. He wanted the freedom to take on the projects he is most passionate about: industrial and public works, such as bridges, schools and public buildings. He also wanted to have more control over the decisions that are made around purchasing and managing project budgets. \"I've seen so much waste in 34 years,\" he said.\r\n \r\nAs the son of a general contractor, Willis is proud to own a professional electrician business. \u201cThere are very few \u2018mom-and-pop\u2019 shops left,\u201d he says, \u201cbecause of the competition from larger players.\u201d As a minority-owned business and a certified Small and Local Business, Willis's shop fulfills an important niche in the Bay Area.\r\n \r\nWillis\u2019s biggest challenge so far has been finding a line of credit to support the upfront costs of larger projects. He sought a small business loan from his bank but, despite being a home-owner and successful businessman, he couldn\u2019t qualify for a loan because he had never borrowed on credit cards and usually avoids taking on debt. When he saw Opportunity Fund\u2019s small business loan program featured on the local news, he decided to apply.\r\n \r\nWith a $5,000 loan, his first from Opportunity Fund, Willis will purchase and install exhaust fans in a building he is working on in Oakland. The loan will act as the line of credit he needs to purchase these costly items before his clients pay him for the job. In addition, this loan will ensure that he is able to start establishing a credit history for his business.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":5000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":5000,"image":{"id":590509,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Electrician","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"To

S\u1ef1 has successfully repaid a previous loan of 6,048,000 VND from SEDA.  This previous loan was used to purchase livestock feed & other supplies.  \r\n\r\nS\u1ef1 is now requesting a new loan of 8,288,000 VND which will be used to purchase young livestock to raise & sell in the future.  The loan will be the 4th loan taken out by her from SEDA.  S\u1ef1 plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her  business.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout SEDA:\r\n\r\nThe mission of SEDA (Center of Small Enterprise Development Assistance) is to provide microfinance services to the low income and disadvantaged people in rural areas of Hanoi and the Northern provinces of Vietnam.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in Vietnamese while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\r\n\r\n\r\nS\u1ef1 Tr\u1ea7n Th\u1ecb (20213020012) l\u00e0 53 tu\u1ed5i n\u1eef.

She owns and operates a business venture, selling fast foods.  She has 1 year of experience in this business.    Ana needs a loan of WST $1,000 to purchase raw ingredients needed to make products for sale.  She plans to use the profit from her business (estimated to be 250 talas or $104 per week) to improve the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2011, Ana joined SPBD to gain access to financial services.  Most of SPBD's clients are unable to borrow from commercial banks because they lack collateral.  This is her 1st loan with SPBD. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*SPBD evaluates the living conditions of each of its borrowers.  Generally, a loan manager evaluates a variety of social metrics on a scale out of 3 (the higher the number, the better off the person is) and these are averaged for the \"\"overall social metric score.\"\"  For example, a 3 out of 3 on \"\"level of education\"\" would mean that the borrower has graduated from university.  \r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.

Today, BRAC has emerged as an independent, virtually self-financed paradigm in sustainable human development. It is one of the largest Southern development organizations employing over 100,000 people, 61% of which are women, and working with the twin objectives of poverty alleviation and empowerment of the poor. Diagnosing poverty in human terms and recognizing its multifaceted nature, BRAC approaches poverty alleviation with a holistic approach.\r\n<br><br>The successes of BRAC in the international development arena have stimulated a series of discussions, both with African delegations, who have visited BRAC programs, and with donors who work in Asia and Africa. Both the African countries and the donors have encouraged BRAC to join the development campaign in Africa to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and more recently to join the campaign of \u201cending poverty\u201d, which is an area where Africa represents the greatest global challenge.\r\n<br><br> In Uganda, BRAC registered as a Non Government Organization (NGO) in January 2006 to undertake programs in Education, Health, Water & Sanitation, Agriculture & Livestock and Microfinance. The Microfinance and Education are the pioneer programs launched in Uganda and, as of July 2007, had served 21,273 borrowers and enrolled 1,155 adolescents in its education

S. tiene 37 a\u00f1os de edad, vive con su c\u00f3nyuge y tiene 2 hijos en edades 8 y 6 a\u00f1os en el barrio El Carmen de Malambo, Municipio del \u00c1rea Metropolitana de Barranquilla y pueblo anfibio del  departamento del Atl\u00e1ntico, nacido a orillas del r\u00edo Magdalena y la Ci\u00e9naga Grande, en \u00e9l que sobreviven las danzas y ritos derivadas de la \u00e9poca de esclavitud en el Atl\u00e1ntico Colombiano, como la Cumbia, el Fandango, La Danza De Negro, La Danza De Los Pajaritos y El Gavil\u00e1n Pio-pio. \nComo en el interior de Malambo sus habitantes no suelen transportarse en taxi, el transporte p\u00fablico se efect\u00faa principalmente en moto taxi, una moto con sillas para dos pasajeros, que pasa por la puerta de la casa de Yadira, ubicada en esta v\u00eda principal, lo cual hace que ella est\u00e9 bien posicionada en su negocio de venta de aceite para motos, debido a que sus clientes principales son los conductores de moto taxi y a que las cortas distancias al interior de Malambo, hacen que la  poblaci\u00f3n utilice este tipo de transporte y hacen de ella una actividad  muy rentable. \nAunque Yadira siempre tuvo un negocio, se inici\u00f3 con la venta de aceites para motos, cuando fu\u00e8 felizmente involucrada  por su prima quien se mud\u00f3 hace cuatro a\u00f1os y se lo dej\u00f3; ella accedi\u00f3 teniendo en cuenta que su casa era el sitio perfecto para comercializar este producto por la  alta circulaci\u00f3n de estos veh\u00edculos, para ello su padre abri\u00f3 un local para su funcionamiento. Ella dice que tiene una ventaja competitiva en este negocio porque es una poblaci\u00f3n que ha aumentado mucho y este crecimiento significa un aumento en el n\u00famero de personas que van transportados por los moto taxis y por consiguiente aumenta la demanda de aceite; adicionalmente tiene una habitaci\u00f3n en su casa dedicada a los videojuegos donde ni\u00f1os y j\u00f3venes del Municipio pueden divertirse, este lo trajo una cu\u00f1ada de Bucaramanga y aunque en el barrio hay mucha competencia, sus equipos son m\u00e1s modernos y ninguna otra sala de videojuegos del municipio tiene los X-Box. As\u00ed que la rotaci\u00f3n del dinero diario por este concepto lo hace bien atractivo para ella y su familia.\nElla solicita un pr\u00e9stamo por valor de  $2.000.000 para comprar aceite y comprar una reja y mejorar la cubierta de la sala de videojuegos lo cual servir\u00e1 para aumentar la seguridad. \u00c9ste es el segundo cr\u00e9dito, efectuado a Yadira por la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo,  entidad a la que le gusta pertenecer, porque considera que  otras organizaciones hacen muchas deducciones, lo que significa que reciben menos dinero; en la Fundaci\u00f3n recibe financiaci\u00f3n de acuerdo de su capacidad de pago. Es m\u00e1s, Yadira  expresa que aprovecha muy bien los cursos y programas formativos que  le ofrecen el la Fundaci\u00f3n y est\u00e1 decidida a  ponerlos en pr\u00e1ctica en el negocio. Con esta actividad apoya los ingresos de la familia y  se siente contenta pues puede enviar a su hija a una escuela de ballet.\nYadira M., dice que su mayor desaf\u00edo personal que enfrenta es la salud de su c\u00f3nyuge porque tuvo que asumir la direcci\u00f3n y parte de los gastos de la familia cuando  \u00e9l se enferm\u00f3, pero por suerte tiene la seguridad social cubierta, porque en este pa\u00eds le prestan todos los servicios a \u00e9l. La meta de su familia es construir un almac\u00e9n de repuestos e insumos para las motos en un lote al lado de su casa, pero aun  sue\u00f1a con tener un local propio e independiente de sus padres y por eso abri\u00f3 una cuenta de ahorros para seguir guardando sus ingresos y as\u00ed poder hacerlo.\n\n\n","en":"Yadira Esther M.

Within the interior region of Malambo, the inhabitants rarely travel by taxi.  The primary mode of transportation is a \u201cmototaxi\u201d, which is a motorcycle with seats for two passengers.  When you come across the front door of Yadira\u2019s house, which is located on the main road, you will find a strategically located business for selling motorcycle oil.  Her main customers are motorcycle taxi drivers who travel short distances within Malambo.  Most of the population utilize this method of transportation, so it can be a very profitable business.\r\n<p>\r\nEven though she already had a business, Yadira decided to begin selling motorcycle oil with her cousin.  The cousin moved away four years ago and she agreed to take over the business entirely.  Her house was the perfect place for selling this type of product because of the high frequency of motorcycle traffic, so her father set aside a space for her to run the business.  Yadira says she has a competitive advantage in her business because of the significant increase in the population.  This type of growth means more people are traveling by motorcycle taxi, which leads to an increase in the demand for oil.  In addition, Yadira has a room in her house where children and teenagers from the neighborhood can come to play video games and have fun.  Her sister-in-law brought in the equipment from Bucaramanga.  Even though Yadira faces stiff competition from other video arcades in town, her equipment is more modern and her business is the only place in the area that has an X-Box.  This particular business was attractive because of the daily income it generates for her and her family. \r\n<p>\r\nYadira is requesting a loan of 2,000,000 COP to buy motorcycle oil and security bars to install in her video game room to provide more safety.  This is her second loan from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, an institution which she enjoys doing business with because she noticed that other organizations made several deductions that decreased the loan amount issued.  With the Foundation, she is able to receive the full amount requested.  In addition, Yadira says that she taken several good courses offered by the Foundation and is determined to implement them in her business.  With her business activities, she is able to provide income for her family and is happy that she is able to send her daughter to ballet classes.\r\n<p>\r\nYadira says the biggest personal challenge she faces is the health of her husband because she had to take charge of the family expenses when he became ill.  Fortunately, she receives payments from the government because in her country she is able to access services that her husband needs. Yadira\u2019s goal for her family is to build a warehouse next to her home where she can sell parts and supplies for motorcycles.  She still dreams of having a home separate from her parents, so she has opened a savings account to set aside the funds needed to achieve this goal.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by

Some believe that success is luck, a lucky fate and something prescribed, a phenomenon which is not in the person's power. Another group of people believes that though you cannot escape from fate however the fate itself gives us a choice in how we want to live. And our success depends on actual efforts and diligence rather than luck. This is the opinion which belongs to the characters of our story. Nurbubu M. is a leader of this group. Nurbubu has three children. Her oldest daughter is married. Her middle son is in his sophomore year in the Agrarian university, and her youngest daughter goes to secondary school. The conditions in the village are very difficult considering unemployment and a mass exodus of the population into the cities. But Nurbubu and her husband still tried to find happiness in their homeland. They bought a cow, fed it and resold for ten thousand soms ($200US). The used this money to buy cattle, but this time sheep and since then it has become their main business. Reselling of the cattle has allowed them to send their daughter to study in Bishkek and to prepare her dowry later on. At this time their income is around five thousand soms ($130) a month. Her husband is a member of the farmer's union and is actively helping Nurbubu to take care of the cattle. Right now Nurbubu needs a loan to buy four rams for feeding.\r\n\r\nNurbubu has three partners in the group:\r\n\r\nEdil A.-U. is 21 years old. He is married. His wife works as a teacher. Edil has a son who is only ten months old. Edil works as a head inspector in the regional architectural association. He has decided to ask for a loan to buy GSM (fuel and oil for machinery) for agricultural work.\r\n\r\nNurisa M. is thirty years old. Nurisa's husband is a member of the farmer's union. Nurisa is raising three children. Nurisa's parents-in-law also live together with her family. Her daughter is in third grade and middle son is in the second grade, her youngest daughter is staying at home. Nurisa works as a nurse. She needs a loan to buy a washing machine.\r\n\r\nNurzada K. is thirty one years old. Nurzada has two children. Her oldest son goes to school. Her mother-in-law also lives with Nurzada. To feed the entire family Nurzada sells GSM (fuel and oil for machinery equipment) and her husband is in farming. Nurzada has started selling with a loan which she received a year and a half ago. Right now she again needs a loan to buy 100 liters of fuel and oil.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Russian by Elena Fedorchuk, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":515484,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy four sheep for feeding and resale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Kochkor","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":135,"posted_date":"2010-03-27T21:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":750,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nurbubu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Edil","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nurisa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nurzada","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-14T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":33000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":4878},{"due_date":"2010-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":5111},{"due_date":"2010-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":5356},{"due_date":"2010-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":5612},{"due_date":"2010-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":5881},{"due_date":"2010-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":6162}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110.86},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.16},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":121.73},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":127.55},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":133.65},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":140.05}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":110.86,"local_amount":4878,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:36:09Z","rounded_local_amount":5029.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136715778},{"amount":116.16,"local_amount":5111,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-11T07:45:43Z","rounded_local_amount":5269.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144748625},{"amount":121.73,"local_amount":5356,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-11T07:45:57Z","rounded_local_amount":5522.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151931599},{"amount":127.55,"local_amount":5612,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:35:37Z","rounded_local_amount":5786.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159670610},{"amount":133.65,"local_amount":5881,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:38:36Z","rounded_local_amount":6063.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166884261},{"amount":140.05,"local_amount":6162,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:24:32Z","rounded_local_amount":6353.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172151394}],"funded_date":"2010-03-28T05:08:34Z","paid_date":"2010-10-15T10:24:32Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Elena Fedorchuk","image":1104450}},{"id":193658,"name":"Eric","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Eric G. is from the village of Digkilaan, Iligan City.

First, he becomes patient and prudent. Sweat spilled and effort expended imparts thrift and respect for work as a whole. For this reason, even during times of unemployment and economic decline, the heroes of our story once again show that hardworking people always find work. \r\n\r\nObidohon J. is the leader of this group.  She is sixty years old, and after her husband\u2019s death she was left with two children.  Fortunately, her children have grown up, married, and now there are even grandsons to help Obidohon with her business.  Obidohon works raising cattle and cultivating cotton.  Her elder son is thirty-nine, and her younger son is thirty.  Both of her sons have left to work in the Russian Federation.  However, they left only when they were convinced that the grandsons could look after their grandmother and take care of the household.  Obidohon has been working in animal husbandry for twenty-five years.  Earlier, Obidohon only grew cotton. However, through Obidohon\u2019s diligence and hard work, she produced enough cotton to allow her to buy livestock and begin to raise cattle.  She has managed to marry off her sons and is already thinking about celebrating the weddings of her grandsons. Obidohon is asking for a loan to buy a cow.\r\n\r\nObidohon\u2019s partners in the group:\r\n\r\nDilmuradjan M. is forty-one years old.  Dilmuradjan has two daughters and one son. The entire family works cultivating and harvesting sunflowers, potatoes and carrots. Dilmuradjan recently has begun building a new house.  Now he hopes to obtain a loan to buy building materials. Dilmuradjan expects to receive a second harvest this season, and now all his efforts are directed towards this.\r\n\r\nDilnoza K. is twenty-five years old.  She is married. Dilnoza\u2019s husband is a freelance builder. To help her husband, Dilnoza works in animal husbandry.  She fattens cattle and resells it in the cattle market.  Dilnoza is asking for a loan to buy calves.  In the future, Dilnoza would like to construct a big stable.\r\n\r\nHaticha M. is fifty-three years old.  Haticha is a widow and the mother of two children. So as not to be dependent on her children, Haticha industriously works fattening cattle.  She has a cow with a calf and two sheep. She also sells milk.  Haticha wants to take out a loan to buy a sheep.\r\n\r\n\r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance, a young and ambitious socially-focused MFI in Kyrgyzstan.\r\n\r\nMol Bulak Finance is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development on the basis of 3-Ps concept - People (building human capital and taking care of its customers and the society as well), Profit (to be profitable to grow further) and the Planet (taking care of the environment).

Also, Kydykbek began cultivating potatoes and holy clover on a plot of land and worked hard to get a good harvest of high quality products. \r\n\r\n<p>Now Kydykbek is applying for a loan of 120,000 KGS to buy five bull calves for fattening and resale.

San Antonio, Himamaylan, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating two business ventures:  retailing of Avon products and Ready-To-Wear clothes businesses. Melanie joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2009 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 5 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Melanie has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. \r\n\r\nHer previous loan of PHP 10,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 4,000, thus uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 6th loan, she is borrowing PHP 12,000 which she intends to use to buy Avon products to sell to her neighbors so that she can continue to save up for future improvements of her business. \r\n\r\nMelanie S. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

Fanny\u2019s husband is a merchant.\r\n\r\nShe has a small farm where she raises chickens and pigs.  She buys the chicks from an incubator in Bah\u00eda and keeps them for two to three months until they are ready and at a good weight.  She then butchers them and takes them to the local stores.  She does the same with the pigs.  She raises them for four months and then with her husband\u2019s help she butchers them and sells the meat by the pound to neighbors and locals.  She works every day caring for her little animals about three hours a day except on delivery days when she works up to 8 hours because she has to make all her deliveries.\r\n\r\nThis loan will be used to buy more chickens because the season that\u2019s approaching is a very good one and a lot of these little animals are sold.  This is her second cycle with the communal bank.  She likes it because interest rates are very low compared to banks.  Her dream is that she and her loved ones are always healthy and to see her grandchildren become upstanding

In order to drive profits and to boost the productivity of their land, the group members are seeking their first loan from Soro Yiriwaso. \nBintou Madou is the second lady sitting on the right with the yellow headscarf. She aims to use her loan to purchase good quality seeds, small tools and fertilisers from BLA's large market. After winter, the harvests are stored for a certain amount of time so that they accumulate in value before being sold in the large BLA market, in Yangasso and in the surrounding markets. She sells at wholesale and retail, and takes cash from a customer base predominantly from large towns. \nThe members of the group aim to generate 20,000 to 40,000 FCFA each, which will be used to repay the interest on the loan and to see to their families' everyday needs."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":900,"image":{"id":863390,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"to purchase fertilisers, seeds and small tools","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Kola Sangoula","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":900,"lender_count":30,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Bintou Madou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rokia Z ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sanata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hawa O ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maimouna B ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sata Sidiki ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sali Sidiki ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Djenebou B ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bintou S ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mamou S ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-08-03T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":400000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":400000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":900}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":900,"local_amount":400000,"processed_date":"2012-04-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T11:17:52Z","rounded_local_amount":410704.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276756899}],"funded_date":"2011-10-01T11:41:29Z","paid_date":"2012-05-15T11:17:52Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Danielle Treharne","image":null}},{"id":337092,"name":"Mitos","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mitos is 37 years old and married with four children.\r\n\r\nMitos works hard to provide for her family.

is a native of Cochas GranD..  She was born and raised in a family of farmers and artisans, and this training has helped her succeed.  When she was about 10 years old, her parents taught her the art of carving the \"burilados\" mats and she has trained her six children who also work making these mats.  Carmen feels very satisfied with the work she does, she is delighted that she developed fine strokes, and what especially pleases her is when one of her animals goes to graze in the field, and she draws inspiration from the blue skies to incorporate in her work.  Now, that most of her children are adults, and all that is left is to look after her young ones, she'd like to continue with her work in order to ensure that her children have a better future. Carmen would like to move forward applying for this loan to invest in the purchase of materials and supplies and continue creating her beautiful mats.  She would also like to buy fodder for her animals. Let's join with Carmen and continue generating prosperity for her beloved family.\r\n<p><b>Translated from Spanish by Mayra Gould, Kiva volunteer.<p><\/b>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCarmen, es natural D.

They live in traditional extended families with their husbands, co-spouses and children in the village of Marka-Coungo (in the Koulikoro region of the Republic of Mali). They met through neighborhood and marriage ties, and mainly sell firewood. In addition to firewood, they buy and sell miscellaneous items such as cereals and charcoal.\r\nKeen to build up a decent stock in order to avoid shortages, a year ago they decided, as a group, to join the loan program of the Soro Yiriwaso microfinance institution. Having successfully repaid two previous solidarity loans (group loans), they are now on their third loan.\r\nThey plan to use this loan to stock up on firewood to sell at the market in Bamako (the capital of the Republic of Mali). The firewood is bought in conjunction with peasants holding a wood-cutting permit (in Marka-Coungo and surrounding villages) and stored in the bush until the women obtain the desired quantity.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

This community is notable because its predominant productive activities are agriculture, livestock, and commerce of fish, fruits and vegetables in the street markets of the region of the northern zone of Mexico State. The group is made up of 8 members. Mrs Marisol G. is a member of this group. She is from the community of Emiliano Zapata, and has lived in this community for 26 years. She makes and sells pork rind, an activity that she started 5 years ago. She sells in the street markets surrounding her municipality. Mrs Marisol says that her business was recently strengthened thanks to loans, since now she and her husband work together making this product. Mrs Marisol is 26 and receiving her elementary education. She is married and has 2 children, who currently depend on her and her husband. Thanks to their business, they have gotten their children ahead. She wants this loan in order to continue investing in her business, which for the last 5 years has given her the opportunity to maintain her family and build a small home, since they previously lived in the home of her in-laws. She wants her business to continue to strengthen through this loan. She is currently buying the prime materials for her pork rinds on loan, and wants to soon have her own capital so that her sales can increase, and this way she will be able to stock the pork rinds at a lower price and create greater demand for her products."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2925,"image":{"id":618317,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to invest in the business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Estado de M\u00e9xico","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":158,"posted_date":"2010-10-17T10:30:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2925,"lender_count":90,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marisol","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Norma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Rosenda Juana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Clemencia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Santa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Brigida","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alicia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Susana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-10-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":36000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":2925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1848},{"due_date":"2010-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1895},{"due_date":"2010-10-29T07:00:00Z","amount":1944},{"due_date":"2010-11-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1994},{"due_date":"2010-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":2045},{"due_date":"2010-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":2097},{"due_date":"2010-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":2151},{"due_date":"2010-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":2207},{"due_date":"2010-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":2263},{"due_date":"2010-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":2321},{"due_date":"2010-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":2381},{"due_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":2442},{"due_date":"2011-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":2505},{"due_date":"2011-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":2569},{"due_date":"2011-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":2635},{"due_date":"2011-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":2703}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":150.15},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":153.97},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":157.95},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":162.01},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":166.16},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":170.38},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":174.77},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":179.32},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":183.87},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":188.58},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":193.45},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":198.42},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":203.53},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":208.73},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":214.09},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":219.62}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":462.07,"local_amount":5687,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T13:29:12Z","rounded_local_amount":5735.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177387598},{"amount":673.4,"local_amount":8288,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T13:40:23Z","rounded_local_amount":8358.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182525494},{"amount":943.56,"local_amount":11614,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T12:48:57Z","rounded_local_amount":11712.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188660037},{"amount":845.97,"local_amount":10411,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T02:40:15Z","rounded_local_amount":10499.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191403306}],"funded_date":"2010-10-17T15:44:28Z","paid_date":"2011-02-16T02:40:15Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Christine Cooper","image":1766620}},{"id":242845,"name":"Beth","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Beth is a 35-year-old lady, married and blessed with two children who are in school.

Having fully repaid a previous loan of 7,000 PHP from PMPC, Rio is now requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP, to purchase additional seeds, seedlings and green crops to grow.

Her daily income is between 45,000 F and 50,000 F. \r\nHer previous loan allowed her to put some money aside for savings and to bolster her business. She improved her restaurant's facilities by adding a seating area inside.  With her second loan she aims to purchase: a bag of rice, a basket of smoked fish, 10kg of beef, 1 flask of oil, 1 string of onions, 1 tin of salted cod, peanut butter, beans and a tin of tomatoes. \r\nHer two children are grown up and independent, with their own jobs, and she pays for the schooling of two other children in her care. She thinks that her business is growing each day, and wishes to put some more money aside to buy a plot of land for her children.

Mr. Abdoulaye, who feeds and fattens his cattle before the sale, increases his dairy yield thanks to higher-quality cows.\nWith this loan, he is planning on making a monthly profit of 350,000 FCFA. This will mainly be used to increase his working capital, contribute to the family's expenses and repay his loan's interests."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":863408,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"to buy oxes.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sikasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.316667 -5.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1100,"lender_count":40,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Abdoulaye ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-08-02T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2011-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2011-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2011-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2012-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2012-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2012-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2012-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2012-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2012-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":220,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2011-10-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T11:22:58Z","rounded_local_amount":100394.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238699234},{"amount":110,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2011-11-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T11:12:12Z","rounded_local_amount":50197.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244655503},{"amount":110,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2011-12-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T11:22:38Z","rounded_local_amount":50197.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250874294},{"amount":110,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2012-01-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:47:49Z","rounded_local_amount":50197.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257283120},{"amount":110,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2012-02-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T11:00:21Z","rounded_local_amount":50197.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263424626},{"amount":110,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2012-03-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-11T08:19:35Z","rounded_local_amount":50197.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270139908},{"amount":110,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2012-04-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T11:17:48Z","rounded_local_amount":50197.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276756902},{"amount":110,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2012-05-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T19:01:00Z","rounded_local_amount":50197.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283251690},{"amount":110,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2012-06-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T10:18:28Z","rounded_local_amount":50197.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287410737}],"funded_date":"2011-10-04T12:26:20Z","paid_date":"2012-07-15T10:18:28Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Charlotte Buecheler","image":566239}},{"id":337108,"name":"Cecilia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Cecilia is 50 years old and married with four children.

Cambodia.

Her son buys raw hides from countryside herders and she then sells them to buyers in the center of the province. Sometimes Tumurbaatar goes to Ulaanbaatar to sell raw hides for a higher price. Dulmaa also runs a sewing business from her home, making traditional coats called \"deels.\" During April, students who will graduate in May order traditional dresses for their graduation celebration. To prepare for the spike in demand Dulmaa prepares many different colors of silk. Dulmaa has a wonderful work ethic and a positive attitude.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\n\n\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":404872,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"To purchase clothes in bulk for her business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbarali","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.433333 34.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-10-13T07:20:17Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":625,"lender_count":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Getruda   ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-10-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":800000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":133333.33},{"due_date":"2009-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":133333.33},{"due_date":"2010-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":133333.33},{"due_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":133333.33},{"due_date":"2010-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":133333.33},{"due_date":"2010-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":133333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":104.17},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":104.16},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":104.17},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.17},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.16},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":104.17,"local_amount":133333.33,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:45:40Z","rounded_local_amount":136770.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103868396},{"amount":104.16,"local_amount":133333.33,"processed_date":"2009-12-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T16:45:57Z","rounded_local_amount":136770.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110757592},{"amount":104.17,"local_amount":133333.33,"processed_date":"2010-01-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:35:05Z","rounded_local_amount":136770.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118146686},{"amount":104.17,"local_amount":133333.33,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T11:16:39Z","rounded_local_amount":136770.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123984831},{"amount":104.16,"local_amount":133333.33,"processed_date":"2010-03-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-10T13:01:37Z","rounded_local_amount":136770.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":129015504},{"amount":104.17,"local_amount":133333.35,"processed_date":"2010-04-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-10T13:03:26Z","rounded_local_amount":136770.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136740510}],"funded_date":"2009-10-18T18:46:04Z","paid_date":"2010-12-10T13:03:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":147869,"name":"Phalla's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Phalla T. is a group leader of four members who all lives in Popeal Khaer village in Kandal province.

all over the world. Probably the main problem that causes most of the uprisings and revolts in Third World countries is the expanding rupture between the rich and the poor. So, what the microfinance organizations have been doing has greatly relieved the situation, as it has given tens of millions of people an opportunity to start their business and improve their standard of living. An amount of money that may seem nothing to a rich businessman, who spends this sum every day having lunch in a restaurant, is to another person vital initial capital, with which he or she could start a new life. And that\u2019s what makes this life interesting! \r\n<p>Erkebubu is the leader of this loan group. She is 49 and the mother of two children. She is raising her children on her own as she has been divorced for the last few years. To provide for her little family, Erkebubu produces national milk soft drinks \u2013 \u201cbozo\u201d and \u201cmaksym\u201d (see http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Kyrgyz_cuisine for more information). This seemingly small business has allowed her to make repairs in her apartment. Now her monthly income has reached $420. Erkebubu needs a loan to increase the amount of drinks she sells. She hopes to save money to buy strawberry seedlings.\r\n<p>\r\nErkebubu\u2019s partners are: \r\n<br>Gulmira, 38, is divorced. She has two children and needs a loan for personal use. She is planning to purchase furniture.\r\n<br>Erkingul, 34, is a mother of two children. Her husband provides welding services. Erkingul is engaged in network marketing and sells perfumes, cosmetics and detergents. She is requesting a loan to purchase goods and also buy a TV set with plasma screen. \r\n<br>Chinara is the youngest member of this group at 25 years old. She works as a saleswoman selling bed clothing and dishes. She decided to apply for a loan after her sister advised her to purchase more goods to attract more customers. Chinara\u2019s current monthly income is $185. \r\n<p>\r\n<b>Where did this loan come from?<\/b><br>\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance, a young and ambitious socially-focused MFI in Kyrgyzstan.

She lives with her husband and their children in Wayerma II, one of several populous neighborhoods in Sikasso (third administrative region of the Republic of Mali).\r\n\r\nMrs. Karidia B. is a trained caregiver who has never practiced as such. Four years ago she began trading various items she sells in a store located in the front of her home: mineral water, eggs, cigarettes, candy, matches, chewing-gum, powdered milk, tea, sugar, etc. She is quite in demand by her customers for the quality of her products.\r\n\r\nTo satisfy an increasing number of customers, she decided three years ago to join the Soro Yiriwaso MFI. After four group loans in a neighbourhood women\u2019s association (the Benkadi Association of Wayerma I), she is now requesting a third individual loan. All preceding loans have been correctly reimbursed.\r\n\r\nWith this loan she will buy: four cartons of various cigarettes, 10 packages of chewing-gum, two cartons of powdered milk (in bags), 10 large packages of tea, one bag of sugar, 10 packages of sweets, four cartons of Diago mineral water, 20 matchboxes, etc.\r\n\r\nShe gets her supplies from local wholesalers before selling them retail, for cash or credit, to customers from the area and particularly the young. She hopes to reach monthly earnings of 200,000 FCFA which will be used to increase her working capital, share family expenses, reimburse her loan and invest the remainder in her business. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Ren\u00e9 McConnell, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":850,"image":{"id":525502,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"Buy various general store products","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sikasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.316667 -5.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2010-04-18T20:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":850,"lender_count":31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Karidia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":400000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":80000},{"due_date":"2010-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":80000},{"due_date":"2010-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":80000},{"due_date":"2010-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":80000},{"due_date":"2011-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":80000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":170},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":170},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":170},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":170},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":170}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":170,"local_amount":80000,"processed_date":"2010-05-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T10:03:34Z","rounded_local_amount":82339.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144779200},{"amount":170,"local_amount":80000,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T12:01:33Z","rounded_local_amount":82339.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159699518},{"amount":170,"local_amount":80000,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:40:55Z","rounded_local_amount":82339.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172180591},{"amount":170,"local_amount":80000,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:40:25Z","rounded_local_amount":82339.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182613364},{"amount":170,"local_amount":80000,"processed_date":"2011-01-17T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-17T00:57:13Z","rounded_local_amount":82339.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191606082}],"funded_date":"2010-04-20T14:12:35Z","paid_date":"2011-02-17T00:57:13Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ren\u00e9 McConnell","image":467423}},{"id":197788,"name":"Mirembe Katenga, Kyenjojo Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Hardworking M.

With this loan he hopes to achieve that and thus will be able to take care of his family.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3700,"image":{"id":533372,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Motorcycle Transport","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"To purchase a motorcycle","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Kyenjojo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"2 33","type":"point"}},"partner_id":84,"posted_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:42Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":3700,"lender_count":119,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lawrence","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Wycliff","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Samuel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Herbert","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Apollo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nathan","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juma","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Edward","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Haryensi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Levi","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Francis","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-04-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":7800000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":3700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1300000},{"due_date":"2010-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1300000},{"due_date":"2010-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1300000},{"due_date":"2010-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1300000},{"due_date":"2010-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1300000},{"due_date":"2010-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1300000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":616.67},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":616.66},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":616.67},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":616.67},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":616.66},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":616.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":616.67,"local_amount":1300000,"processed_date":"2010-05-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:49:03Z","rounded_local_amount":1301884.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144767383},{"amount":616.66,"local_amount":1300000,"processed_date":"2010-06-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-20T07:46:15Z","rounded_local_amount":1301884.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":152662400},{"amount":616.67,"local_amount":1300000,"processed_date":"2010-07-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:46:30Z","rounded_local_amount":1301884.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159689170},{"amount":616.67,"local_amount":1300000,"processed_date":"2010-08-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:47:22Z","rounded_local_amount":1301884.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166903341},{"amount":616.66,"local_amount":1300000,"processed_date":"2010-09-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-16T09:15:15Z","rounded_local_amount":1301884.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172296878},{"amount":616.67,"local_amount":1300000,"processed_date":"2010-10-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T15:34:24Z","rounded_local_amount":1301884.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177467210}],"funded_date":"2010-05-28T05:59:20Z","paid_date":"2010-11-15T15:34:24Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jeff Avery","image":233371}},{"id":201885,"name":"Tom\u00e1s","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El Sr. Tom\u00e1s B. es de la compa\u00f1\u00eda Simbr\u00f3n,  cuenta con casa propia, se dedica a la compra \u2013 venta de animales vacunos, esta actividad econ\u00f3mica lo realiza hace varios a\u00f1os. \n\nCuenta con mucha experiencia en la actividad que realiza, lo que le permite tener un buen manejo del negocio, mencionando que cuenta con buena clientela. \nSu metodolog\u00eda consiste en que el compra los animales y con un tratamiento en cuanto a la alimentaci\u00f3n y sanitaci\u00f3n r\u00e1pidamente puden ser vendidos con mejor precio.\n\nSolicita el pr\u00e9stamo para la compra de animales vacunos.\n","en":"Mr. Tom\u00e1s B. is with the company, \"Simbr\u00f3n\".

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.
