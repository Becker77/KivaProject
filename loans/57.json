It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.<P>\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<P>\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

They have six children who range in age from 19 to 38 years old. \r\n\r\nMelly joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1992 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 16 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Melly has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 15,000 Philippine pesos (PHP) helped her earn a monthly profit of 7,000 PHP, thus bettering the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 17th loan cycle, she is borrowing 15,000 PHP, which she intends to use to purchase fresh meat and vegetable for her fast-food eatery so that she can continue to save up for the future and for her youngest child's schooling.

With nostalgia, this happily married father of two children recalls how his business basked in high profit returns at its onset. Times have changed, however, as the business now is in diminishing returns, earning him 150,000 Ugandan shillings in sharp contrast to previous earnings due to seasonal changes.\r\n\r\nMoses is no exception herein in terms of doing business. What he is looking forward to now is the prospect of enhancing his business by buying fertilizer and improving the production of beans and maize which he grows most. He has other income generating activities like a bar and a butcher shop. With this loan, he will improve his production and can afford business expansion. His revenue will increase and also he can make himself more able to meet his day-to-day life and family

He lives in a traditional large extended family in Hamdallaye, a peripheral area of the town of Sikasso (the third administrative district of Mali).\r\n\r\nNot having had the chance to attend school and coming from a family of blacksmiths, he quickly learned this family trade early on and became a blacksmith as well. He purchases aluminum in Bamako in order to make various objects out of it (pots, tea kettles, plates, spoons etc).\r\nWith his long experience and good business reputation, he is very much in demand as clients appreciate the high quality of his service. At present, given his limited means, he is unable to satisfy the growing customer demand. He joined the Soro Yiriwaso microfinance institution  over a year ago and already obtained a loan, perfectly repaid.  And so, in order to continue growing his business and better satisfy the growing demand, he is seeking a second loan to purchase 950 kg [approx. 2100 lbs] of aluminum and some additional materials.\r\n\r\nWith this loan, he plans to achieve a monthly revenue of 300,000 West African Francs. The revenues from this activity will allow him to repay his loan and provide for his family\u2019s needs as well as reinvest the remaining funds into this business. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":632654,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Blacksmith","sector":"Manufacturing","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"Purchasing aluminum and additional materials","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sikasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.316667 -5.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2010-11-04T02:40:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1075,"lender_count":30,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nouhoum ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-10-06T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":1075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-05T07:00:00Z","amount":166666.67},{"due_date":"2011-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":166666.67},{"due_date":"2011-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":166666.66}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":358.33},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":358.34},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":358.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":358.33,"local_amount":166666.67,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:40:03Z","rounded_local_amount":169120.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182613662},{"amount":358.34,"local_amount":166666.67,"processed_date":"2011-01-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-17T00:56:46Z","rounded_local_amount":169120.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191606360},{"amount":358.33,"local_amount":166666.66,"processed_date":"2011-03-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T12:12:20Z","rounded_local_amount":169120.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201360935}],"funded_date":"2010-11-04T07:04:53Z","paid_date":"2011-04-15T12:12:20Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Katharina S","image":340594}},{"id":248904,"name":"Rasheeda's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rasheeda lives in a small city called Kot Radha Kishan which is located in Punjab Pakistan and famous for its agriculture and dairy industry.

F. is a married woman who lives in Brgy. Pangobilian, Brooke's Point, Palawan. She earns her living by operating a food market business.  Her husband Carlos, who is 58 years old, works as a laborer to earn his living and helps in his wife's business activities.  They have four children who are 30 to 34 years old. Lourdes joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2004 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 16 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Lourdes has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 24,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 17,000, improving the family's standard of living. This time, for her 17th loan, she is borrowing PHP 25,000, which she intends to use to buy meat and vegetables for her food market so she can continue to save up for the future expansion of her business. Lourdes F. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Concerned about making their plantations profitable, they decided to join the loan program of the micro-finance institution Soro Yiriwaso four years ago. After properly repaying the previous loans, they are now on their fourth farm loan.\r\n\r\nHAWA, standing in the middle in the photo, intends to use her loan to buy a sufficient quantity of peanut seeds, sundry supplies and equipment, and inputs for farming. These items are purchased at the main market of Kimparana City. \r\n\r\nFollowing the off-season, the harvested crops are stocked for a certain time, so that they gain value, and then are sold at the retail level and for cash at the main market of Kimparana and at surrounding markets. The customers generally come from large cities. \r\n\r\nAfter selling their produce, the group members each plan on making a profit of 45,000 to 70,000 francs CFA that will be used to repay the loan interest and to cover typical family expenses.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":789521,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"to buy farm inputs, seeds, and tools","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Moribila Kafonon","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1075,"lender_count":40,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maramou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Minata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Baro ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Niefila ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maramou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sali Moussa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hawa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-05-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":485000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":1075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":485000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1075}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":1075,"local_amount":485000,"processed_date":"2012-02-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-17T08:31:50Z","rounded_local_amount":485314.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263424523}],"funded_date":"2011-07-07T00:21:55Z","paid_date":"2012-04-17T08:31:50Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Daniel Kuey","image":669418}},{"id":310368,"name":"Susana Celia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Susana es socia del Banco Comunal \u201cSan Juan de Tahuaco\u201d ubicado en Centro Poblado Sanquira, distrito de Yunguyo, provincia Yunguyo y departamento de Puno, tiene 26 a\u00f1os de edad, es conviviente y tiene 01 hijo.

Hern\u00e1ndez, and I am a businesswoman. I started my business more than 10 years ago, selling children\u2019s clothing in street markets in the towns around San Pedro Sacatep\u00e8quez where I live. My husband worked alongside me in the business, but as we have six children, we didn\u2019t earn enough money just doing that. After a lot of effort, we managed to rent a stall in the market, and for the last year I have been selling frequently used products. I am asking for a loan so that I can invest in products that the customers demand and that I need to stock so as to increase my customer base. I am very happy as I have gradually seen my business grow. However, my dream is to finish paying for the market stall so that it is finally mine. Then I can enlarge it, and with the income from that, I can provide better education for my children--of the six, only 2 are in school--but I want all of them to go to school and do well.\r\n<p><b>Translated from Spanish by Jane Agg, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nSoy Marta Isabel G.

His plans for the future are to fix his house because, during the rainy season, thanks to the poor condition of the roof, it leaks.  He would like to see his house finished but, because of his low income, he hasn't been able to complete construction.  With this financing he will buy building materials so that he can improve his quality of life.

Su mayor desaf\u00edo se presenta a principios del a\u00f1o, porque se disminuyen sus ventas,  pero el se prepara ahorrando para cuando llegue esta \u00e9poca, porque alg\u00fan d\u00eda espera  lograr una buena ubicaci\u00f3n de su punto de servicio  en su casa propia \n","en":"Rafael C. is a very cheerful man who lives with his wife and their two children (ages 15 and 17) in the municipality of Malambo.  He is a hard worker who went to school to learn the electronics trade 15 years ago.  With the goal of supporting his family, he undertook his dream of having his own business.  This is how his home electronics repair shop was born.  At first, he worked in the Soledad municipality, and now his shop is located in Malambo.  He not only offers repair services there, but he also sells secondhand home electronics.  His neighbors and the community of Malambo in general have become his customers.\r\n\r\nThis is his third loan from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  He will buy secondhand home electronics with this loan, as well as spare parts for repairing the damaged devices that his clients bring in.  The previous loans have made it easier for him to purchase merchandise and the parts needed to maintain or repair home electronics.  Rafael hopes to continue growing with the help of this organization, because his dream is to buy his own home and to see his children finish university.  He faces his greatest challenge at the beginning of the year, when sales drop.  However, he has prepared by saving for this period, because one day he hopes to have a good spot to run his shop out of his own home."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":850,"image":{"id":622809,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Electronics

Finishing only elementary school, Concepcion is ever determined to break people's low expectations of her. She is married to Danilo, a carpenter, and they have been blessed with two children who are still studying in high school. \r\n\r\nConcepcion's home serves both as an abode of rest and a venue for business, because at her home she has set up a junk shop to earn a living. She buys and sells a wide range of junk items, like plastics, bottles, newspapers, old and damaged kitchen and home appliances and the like. With this, Concepcion earns a net average of 300 PHP per day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operation of her business, she is requesting for a 20,000 PHP loan.

She lives with her three children in her own house. For more than six months she has been selling food, in particular, breakfasts, as an ambulatory vendor. Her sales spot is in front of a private university that is near her house. Sometimes her daughter helps her tend her business, waiting on customers in the mornings. Her best sales are from April to December, when classes are in session. Nevertheless, when the vacation period comes, she finds it advantageous to work at another business; in this way she doesn't stop earning income. So she knits articles of clothing to sell later.\r\n\r\nSabina considers any business that she proposes to be very important, but now she wants to intensify and increase her food business. This is her fourth loan with MFP. She is very happy to know that she has financial support, since she has always shown that she is responsible in her payments.

She lives in Bayawan City, Negros Oriental. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2007 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. \r\n\r\nBy working hard in her fish vending business, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 20,000. Julieta is  borrowing PHP 30,000 so that she  can fund operations. This will be her 12th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 30,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Julieta aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the  Dungganon way.\r\n\r\n About NWTF:\r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed on a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest

International\n\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is a hardworking single mother of three children, who are between the ages of four and seven. She is also a loving guardian to her two brothers who came into her care after the death of their parents. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Using money saved from selling charcoal, Salome opened up a cosmetics shop two years ago. She created the shop by partitioning part of her residence in Namasuba. She sells perfumes, hair additions, hair relaxers, and lotions, among other things. These sales earn her a minimum profit of UGX 60,000 per week. Besides, she also sells safe piped-water to households in her locality at the rate of UGX 50 per jerrican.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>She would therefore use the loan to purchase cosmetics, like Movit relaxer and treatment, TCB Naturals, botanical marrow, mayonnaise treatment, Venus, and Dark & Lovely, among others. This added inventory will allow her to meet the rising demands of customers and also compete favourably in the market. She has an ambition to open up a ladies' boutique and also ensure those entrusted into her care go through their education successfully at all levels.<\/p>

En consecuencia Norma se levanta cerca de las 5 de la ma\u00f1ana para preparar los alimentos para que a las 8 de la ma\u00f1ana pueda llevar su ganado al campo y as\u00ed le alcanze el tiempo para llevar el almuerzo a su esposo, el cual trabaja en la chacra, ayud\u00e1ndolo, con la siembra de habas, papas y ma\u00edz. Pero algunas veces se le presentan dificultades; como la rancha (plaga que se ocasiona por la exesiva lluvia, ocasionando que el gusano afecte directamente el fruto), por ello tiene que estar verificando constantemente sus cultivos y de ese modo tratar de contrarrestar los males que acechan su chacra y as\u00ed salvar sus cosechas. A Norma le agrada la agricultura aunque no siempre gane tanto como se lo propone, sus planes a corto y largo plazo est\u00e1n basados en las ganancias de su producci\u00f3n. Norma tiene el cargo de vocal en el banco comunal al que pertenece, este es su 2do pr\u00e9stamo con MFP, y en todo este tiempo ha demostrado pagar sus cuotas con mucha responsabilidad. El dinero que solicita es para comprar abono, nitratos y dem\u00e1s pesticidas para contrarrestar al gusano que asecha su chacra de habas y as\u00ed logre obtener su producto en buen estado para que sea atractivo para la venta.","en":"Norma is 28 years old and has lived with her husband  for 11.5 years. She is the mother of two children who live in her home. Her parents were farmers and she inherited their land along with the responsibility to work that land, being the only her only source to generate income for herself and support her family. Consequently Norma gets up around 5 in the morning to prepare meals so that at 8 in the morning she can take her cattle to pasture and in this way have enough time to take her husband lunch. He works on the farm, helping with the planting of beans, potatoes, and corn. But sometimes they have difficulty; as when the mold from excessive rain causes the worms to affect the crop, so he has to be constantly checking his crops and in this way attempt to prevent the pestilences that can affect the farm and in this way save his crops. Normal likes farming even though she doesn\u2019t always earn as much money as she hopes. Her short term and long term plans are based on her earnings from her crop production. Norma has the spokesperson position in her communal bank. This is her second loan with MFP and in all this time she has demonstrated great responsibility with her payments. The  money she seeks is to buy fertilizer, nitrates, and other pesticides to counteract the worm that affects her bean crop and in this way be able to have her products be good quality and attractive for its sale.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Cindy Kendall, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":279985,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Buy fertilizer and pesticide","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-02-28T20:30:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":225,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Norma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-02-03T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":700,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":116.67},{"due_date":"2009-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":116.67},{"due_date":"2009-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":116.67},{"due_date":"2009-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":116.67},{"due_date":"2009-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":116.67},{"due_date":"2009-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":116.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":116.67,"processed_date":"2009-03-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:32:45Z","rounded_local_amount":122.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27117205},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":116.67,"processed_date":"2009-04-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:41:30Z","rounded_local_amount":122.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36012116},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":116.67,"processed_date":"2009-05-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T00:53:56Z","rounded_local_amount":122.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44595701},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":116.67,"processed_date":"2009-06-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:37:26Z","rounded_local_amount":122.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52989963},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":116.67,"processed_date":"2009-07-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:38:58Z","rounded_local_amount":122.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63211094},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":116.65,"processed_date":"2009-08-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:17:20Z","rounded_local_amount":122.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73640595}],"funded_date":"2009-02-28T23:26:57Z","paid_date":"2009-09-15T19:17:20Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Cindy Kendall","image":797722}},{"id":96485,"name":"Gregoria","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Gregoria tiene 44 a\u00f1os, vive en la casa que consigui\u00f3 con mucho sacrifico y trabajando mucho, es soltera y lo que m\u00e1s desea es tener una vejez tranquila.

She lives in the house she was able to get through much sacrifice and hard work.   She is single, and what she wants most of all is to be worry free when she reaches her old age.  She has been in the business of making ice cream for 9 years.  Up until now everything has gone very well.  She makes ice cream to distribute to the stores where she has contracts.  The customers buy her ice cream quickly because it tastes so good.  What she likes best about her work is the freedom she has.  She is able to see to her business, and at the same time she can take care of her home.  What she does not like is how cold she gets every time she makes the ice cream.  In the future, Gregoria would like to have her own ice cream parlor where she could sell her ice cream.  She knows that the road to achieving her goals is difficult, but she is determined to meet the challenge.  This is her fourth loan with MFP.  She has always made her payments on time, and she expects to be able to do the same with this loan as well.  She is very active in her community bank.

She has five children and unfortunately, the twin babies inside her womb were aborted just recently for reasons she don't know. It was a indeed a heartbreak for Marlene and her husband, Jimmy, because they did not know that the six month fetus inside her womb were twins. Because of poverty and no enough nutritious food taken, she might have not given them proper nurture. However, Marlene had to move on with her life and her dreams for her other five children. She recently applied for a loan in ASHI amounting to PhP 48,000 in order to purchase a motorcycle in installment basis having a downpayment of Php20,000 and sidecar in cash payment of Php30,000 for her tricycle (motorcycle with sidecar attached to it) for her husband to drive. \r\n\r\nTricycle is one of the main means of transportation of people coming in and out of the village all throughout the municipality. Marlene's husband has been driving a tricycle for hire owned by other people for 20 years now. This is Marlene's daily source of income since her farming business which was her primary business since the beginning of her membership in ASHI, can only generate income every four months. With the increasing need of her family finances her husband and their farming business can hardly sustain, they have to increase their income. Having their own tricycle to be driven by her husband, the whole of his daily earnings will go to the family because he doesn't have to pay for the tricycle rental. \r\n\r\nHaving been a very good member of ASHI in the past nine years, showing a very good performance in payment, attendance and business, there would be no doubt that Marlene will be able to do better with her present loan applied. Her dreams of giving her children better education and better life motivates her to move on and make good in her business.

There are 11 members.  They are very hard-working small business owners who look to improve the condition of their economic lives through their businesses.  They do this to give their families the best every day.  \r\n\r\nHere is Mar\u00eda Rita\u2019s case.  I am 52, married, and have two adult children.  I started as a small businesswoman over 15 years ago because I saw that my husband\u2019s salary was not enough to improve our house made of reeds and corrugated metal or to buy things for the house.  I sold kerosene from my house, I boarded people, I cleaned houses, and I then sold gelatin and fruit lollipops.  I always had my husband\u2019s support.  \r\n\r\nThe time came when I decided to establish a small store.  To do this I bought a little bit of each thing (rice, sugar, eggs, noodles, potatoes, oil, milk, detergent, and others).  I invested the earnings each time in setting up the store more.  Now, my store is one of the best stocked in the area where I live.  This helped me build my house from strong material, help my mother, give my son a post high school education (police), and pay other expenses.\r\n\r\nI need the loan to get merchandise like detergent, rice, and sugar.

They lives in the neighborhood of Las Calamares in the southwestern section of Cartagena de Indias.\r\n<p>\r\nShe sells fish while her husband works as a carpenter.  Therefore, she has two reasons why she is applying for a loan worth 2,000,000 COP.  She plans to buy a sufficient quantity of fish to sell during Holy Week as well as wood to make furniture requested by her husband\u2019s customers.  \r\n<p>\r\nAna started her business in 2001 when she bought a freezer.  She began with 200,000 COP of savings, which she accumulated coin by coin and kept in a piggy bank.  Ana was determined to sell her products even though she had no experience and had to deal with her mother\u2019s health problems and a child who left home.  Slowly she was able to move forward with her business and also support her husband with his carpentry, since he is well-known for his trade.  Ana decided to apply for a loan from the Foundation in order to strengthen both businesses at the same time by expanding them, especially the carpentry business since it had been in operation already for two years.  It is now the primary family business.\r\n<p>\r\n This is Ana\u2019s seventh loan with the Foundation. She began with a loan of 1,200,000 COP and has received as much as 2,800,000 COP.  Ana is grateful to the organization because it has helped to simultaneously support two family businesses that have grown since receiving the first loan.  This has also improved her conditions at home and helped her son who has now started his own family.   \r\n<p>\r\nAna hopes that the carpentry business will grow so that she can work with it full-time.  At the moment, she supplements this work by selling fish and with a job working at a hotel to earn additional income.  She recognizes that her goal will be achieved when the carpentry business generates enough income to fully support her household.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva

business. She lives in Yulo St., Brgy. 8, Isabela, Negros Occidental. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 1999 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her used clothing business, she is gradually making her family more economically stable.  She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 15,000. Segia is now borrowing PHP 30,000 so that she can continue funding her business operations. This will be her 19th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 29,500, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey towards economic freedom.

migr\u00f3 al pueblo llamado Huasahuasi donde vive en una casa alquilada. Luego que su padre fuera a trabajar de pe\u00f3n a las chacras del pueblo de Huasahuasi (zona denominada \u201cCapital de la papa del Per\u00fa\u201d), not\u00f3 que no hab\u00edan negocios de comida, como por ejemplo desayunos para los agricultores; entonces de regreso a su hogar comunic\u00f3 a su familia la idea de ser pioneros en la venta de comida; como jugos de maca, quinua, leche y s\u00e1ndwich diversos, para de ese modo captar ganancias para su econom\u00eda. Se inici\u00f3 con una carreta peque\u00f1a preparando desayunos al paso, logrando una  buena aceptaci\u00f3n, debido a ello, su madre migr\u00f3 hacia ese lugar y puso otra carreta, pero esta vez de guisos. Es as\u00ed que Yudy sigue con el negocio familiar que en todo este tiempo le ha resultado muy rentable, por ello empieza su actividad de dos y media a cinco de la ma\u00f1ana, instal\u00e1ndose en el parque de la zona, donde todos sus clientes la esperan, hasta las diez de la ma\u00f1ana que es cuando termina con la venta. Yudy se siente muy contenta con su negocio, sus metas pr\u00f3ximas son de aperturar un nuevo negocio con la venta de bebidas en un local alquilado. Este es su primer pr\u00e9stamo con MFP, y le han delegado el cargo de vocal, que promete cumplir con mucha responsabilidad, del mismo modo hace el compromiso de pagar todas sus cuotas en las fechas programadas. El dinero que solicita es para la compra de harina de maca y de soya para sus mates y jugos, y otra parte la usar\u00e1 para iniciar su negocio de venta de bebidas.","en":"Yudy is 22 years old and has lived with her partner for the past 3 years. She migrated to a town called Huasahuasi 3 years ago, where she lives in a rented house.  When her father went to work as a labourer in the farmland of Huasahuasi (a region known as the potato capital of Peru), she noted that there weren't any businesses selling meals, for example breakfast for the farmers.  When she returned home she told her family her idea that they could be pioneers in the sale of food, including the juice of maca (a nutritionally rich root vegetable which grows in the high mountains of Peru), quinoa, milk and a variety of sandwiches. In this way they could gain income.\r\n\r\nShe started with a small cart preparing quick breakfasts. Achieving a good response, her mother then migrated to the town to run another cart, but this time selling stews.  It is in this way that Yudy continues with the family business that has been very profitable during all of this time. She starts working between 2.30am and 5.00am, locating her cart in the neighbourhood park where all her customers wait for her. She works through until 10.00am, when she finishes her sales for the day. Yudy is very happy with her business. Her goal for the near future is to open a new business selling drinks in a rented shopfront.\r\n\r\nThis is her first loan with MFP, and she has been delegated the role of a member, and is committed to responsibly fulfilling this role.

The zone is located one hour and twenty minutes from the city of Chiclayo, the capital of the Lambayeque region.\r\n\r\nHis work is providing transportation services for passengers in a van. The route he usually covers is Chep\u00e9n \u2013 Pueblo Nuevo. His work routine starts very early in the morning and continues until quite late in the evening. With his income from this activity, he covers his personal expenses and also supports his young son. Denny is aware of the responsibility involved in transporting people, so he always carries out his work with the greatest possible care. \r\n\r\nDue to the continuous use of his vehicle, it has begun to suffer from some problems that require urgent repair. To undertake these repairs, he has decided to request a loan for the first time from Edpyme Alternativa, in the amount of 2000 Peruvian new soles.\r\n\r\nDenny is a calm and responsible person. His greatest desire is to continue working so that he can help his young son get a good education. His neighbors and friends consider him an honest person and someone they can trust. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Patricia Linderman, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":578995,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Transportation","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"Repairing and maintaining the vehicle he uses to transport passengers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Pueblo Nuevo -

She earns her living by operating two business ventures:  Videoke and Candle-vending businesses. Her husband Eduardo Lemosnero, who is 54 years old, is a retired policeman and works as a driver to earn his living.  They have eight children who are between  9 and 28 years old. \r\n\r\nMa. Eva joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2008 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past five loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Ma. Eva has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 10,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 1500, uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 6th loan, she is borrowing PHP 12,000, which she intends to use as extra capital for her business operation so that she can continue to save up for future education of her children. \r\n\r\nMa. Eva L. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \t\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams.

Her husband Jonathan, who is 48 years old, works as a farmer to earn his living and helps in his wife's business activities. They have 10 children who are 3 months old to 22 years old. Ma. Hennie joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2004 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 12 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Ma. Hennie has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 15,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 10,000, uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her 13th loan, she is borrowing PHP 18,000 to purchase more pig feed so that she can continue to save up for the future education and needs of family. Ma.Hennie is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

have 5 dependent children of different ages who study in primary and secondary school. The family has lived in the community of Segunda Candelaria for 18 years. They grow potatoes, broad beans, okra, and red potatoes, and they also have cattle -- 1 milk cow and 4 other cattle being fattened.\r\n\r\nNicolas and his family have limited economic resources and at times, can barely cover the costs of educating their children. For that reason, they are soliciting a loan to buy organic hen droppings, plus 2 head (a yoke) of cattle. They need the yoke of cattle to prepare the fields for planting and to be available when needed for plowing. Other banks in the city would be too far for them to go. \r\n\r\nNicolas is very content to have this opportunity for access to a loan at a time when it is most needed. Finally, he says that with the loan, he will have a better quality of life and can continue in the future to struggle to get ahead economically."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":789629,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farm Supplies","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"buy organic manure and other crop supplies.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"Cochabamba","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-17.383333 -66.15","type":"point"}},"partner_id":140,"posted_date":"2011-06-13T19:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1200,"lender_count":39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nicolas","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-05-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1200,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":1200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2012-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2012-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2013-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":300}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":300}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":300.56,"local_amount":300.56,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:35:17Z","rounded_local_amount":300.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244535096},{"amount":299.44,"local_amount":299.44,"processed_date":"2012-05-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T12:38:17Z","rounded_local_amount":299.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283101727},{"amount":300,"local_amount":300,"processed_date":"2012-11-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T12:57:58Z","rounded_local_amount":300,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322967859},{"amount":300,"local_amount":300,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T09:45:52Z","rounded_local_amount":300,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372903408}],"funded_date":"2011-06-16T03:50:52Z","paid_date":"2013-06-17T09:45:52Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Harold Sims","image":602722}},{"id":310416,"name":"Sokun","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sokun, 42, resides in Kampong Chnang province, Cambodia, an area known for palm products. \r\n\r\nSokun and her husband are employed at the garment factory, earning an income of $3.3 each per day to help cover the family expenses. \r\n\r\nEach month, the family has to spend $100 on food and $50 on the other necessary expenses. \r\n\r\nSokun is requesting a loan of $1,000 to repair her house.

He formed his family there with Justina, his wife of 7 years.  They have two children: Fiorela and Emanuel who they care for in their own house.  He\u2019s a sincere, kind man.  Every day he heads out to his three fields where she grows coffee, achiote [annatto] and bananas in equal proportions.  He relates that during growing season he spends most of the day cultivating, weeding and fertilizing his crops which, once harvested, he sells in the city of Pichanaki where they are well received because his customers are aware of the quality of his crops, especially his coffee beans.  \r\n\r\nDespite having steady income with banana harvesting every two weeks, he also works as a field hand on other fields where he\u2019s paid a considerable sum of money each weekend.  Now, his intention is to improve the quality of his crops, especially the bananas, and this is why he appreciates the support he gets from the communal bank that he belongs to and hopes will become his partner for progress.\r\n\r\nHe belongs to the \u201cLos Amigos Cafetaleros\u201d communal bank and this is his first MFP loan; he\u2019s thankful for the opportunity he\u2019s being given and he\u2019s sure that he\u2019ll reach his objectives.  Besides, he promises to be punctual with his payments.

She will spend it to purchase scrap items being sold in the junk shop. The loan will definitely help her to have a better profit, the more amount invested, the better the profit. \r\n\r\nMedy dreams that her business will become bigger. She wants to have more carts that will be used by her helpers. Having a junk shop is her way of helping the community understand the value of trash.

The weekly fellowship* of CCT continuously inspires her to have an optimistic attitude in life, she sees every individual has a worth in this world just like the scrap items that she recycles. \r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

For 19 years, Irene has been selling potatoes, which she grows on her own land. Because she plants her own crops, most of her work takes place during the first three months of the year. Her husband is always by her side; they work together and care for their children together, too. Irene believes that her business is profitable these days because she sells what she produces, without any middle-man. Her husband also maintains a small vehicle, which he uses to transport merchandise and courier items for their neighbors. This is Irene's second loan with MFP, and she is excited to continue building relationships with other members of her community bank. With this loan, Irene will buy more potato sacks and fertilizer for the next planting season. Some of the money will also go toward vehicle maintenance. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Corinne Gilroy, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":310006,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Fertilizer, vehicle maintenance","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"HUANCAYO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.066667 -75.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-04-28T03:00:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":500,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Irene","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-04-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":188},{"due_date":"2009-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":188},{"due_date":"2009-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":188},{"due_date":"2009-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":188},{"due_date":"2009-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":188},{"due_date":"2009-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":188},{"due_date":"2009-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":188},{"due_date":"2009-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":184}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.67},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.67},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.67},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.67},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.67},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.67},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.67},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":61.31}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":62.67,"local_amount":188,"processed_date":"2009-05-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T00:56:06Z","rounded_local_amount":194.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44596157},{"amount":62.67,"local_amount":188,"processed_date":"2009-06-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:41:58Z","rounded_local_amount":194.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52990432},{"amount":62.67,"local_amount":188,"processed_date":"2009-07-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:43:28Z","rounded_local_amount":194.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63211547},{"amount":62.67,"local_amount":188,"processed_date":"2009-08-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:23:53Z","rounded_local_amount":194.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73641052},{"amount":62.67,"local_amount":188,"processed_date":"2009-09-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:37:37Z","rounded_local_amount":194.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87080511},{"amount":62.67,"local_amount":188,"processed_date":"2009-10-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:08:41Z","rounded_local_amount":194.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96996656},{"amount":62.67,"local_amount":188,"processed_date":"2009-11-17T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:55:00Z","rounded_local_amount":194.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103842143},{"amount":61.31,"local_amount":184,"processed_date":"2009-12-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T15:22:33Z","rounded_local_amount":190.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110733802}],"funded_date":"2009-04-28T05:12:37Z","paid_date":"2010-01-15T15:22:33Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":108805,"name":"Dulia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Dulia  es socia del Banco Comunal \u201cYunga Uyo\u201d en  Distrito de Yunguyo, la  provincia de Chucuito, departamento de Puno, tiene 23 a\u00f1os de edad, estado civil conviviente y tiene 1 hijo.

He lives with his wife and their child in a community called Santa Fe.  It is located in Los Chiles in the Alajuela province.  This community stands out as being a mountainous area and for being very close to the northern border of our country.  Its primary economical activities are livestock and farming.  The specific agricultural activity is planting basic grains, sugarcane, and oranges.\r\n\r\nMateo has farmed all of his life.  He primarily grows vegetables, which have always given good results.  But, due to the lack of money to keep his farm in good shape, it has stopped producing good harvests.\r\n\r\nThat is why Mateo needs a loan for 605,000 colones to buy grass seed, fertilizer, herbicides, and all that is necessary to get the land in optimal condition to start producing like it used to and improve his vegetable sales.\r\n\r\nMateo is a member of the Manatial de Santa Fe Communal Bank, one of the 100 organizations that are part of EDESA in Costa Rica.  This will be his first loan, and he plans to use it to grow more on a personal level and economically.  He is very grateful for the access to the loan provided by this type of business.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva

Pangobilian, Brooke's Point, Palawan. She earns her living by fishing and with a general store business. Her husband, Cornelio, age 60, works as a fisherman to earn his living and also helps with his wife's business activities. They have four children who are 30 to 39 years old. \r\n\r\nLolita joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2007 because she wanted something better for her family. With the help of her past 14 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, and by the sweat of her brow, Lolita has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty. Her previous loan of 19,500 Philippine pesos (PHP) helped her earn a monthly profit of 16,000 PHP, improving her family's standard of living. This time, for her 15th loan, she is borrowing 22,000 PHP which she intends to use to buy a new engine for the fishing boat so that she can continue to save up for the improvement of her business and for her family's security. Lolita B. is a <i>Dungganon<\/i> woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\n<b>About NWTF:<\/b>\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means <u>honorable<\/u>). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them <i>Dungganon<\/i> - a title of esteem  that is bestowed on a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

It was the location for the end of Alexander the Great's rule, and is known for its great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country, with its epic mountain passes, is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mix of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the USSR, damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 per cent of the country is mountainous and only 7 per cent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands of people to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>More about IMON International<\/b><br>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition.

He lives and operates a butchery at Embakasi Division along the North Airport Road, within Nairobi. James started his business in the year 2004. This was after he researched butcheries in Embakasi Division and found that there was only one butchery in the whole neighborhood. Being a business-minded person, James therefore decided to take a risk and open his own butchery. In order to do this, he sold his old pick-up truck for Ksh.250,000 (US$ 3,680).\r\n<P>\r\nUsing this money as his initial capital, James constructed a small stall on an undeveloped piece of land that he had purchased earlier. During this time, many residents in the neighborhood encouraged James to open the butchery quickly, since the only other butchery operator used to cheat his clients by selling less meat, since he purposely used faulty scales. Some of the customers also suspected that they were eating un-inspected meat, which during this time may have included donkey meat and some wild game, which is illegal in Kenya.<P>\r\n \r\nDue to James' honesty and friendly nature, many customers flock to his butchery, where he sells high quality meat. Apart from that, the area where his business is located is highly industrial, hence many company workers flock to his butchery to have some \"nyama choma\", \"mbuzi choma\" or \"kuku choma\", (these are traditional Kenyan delicacies of roasted beef, roasted goat meat and chicken respectively) together with ugali (a thick paste made from corn flour) and chips (potato fries), which James introduced some eight months ago upon the request of his customers.<P>\r\n\r\nDue to the increased number of customers, James intends to expand his business so as to satisfy his customers\u2019 demand for beef, chicken and fish. James is kindly requesting a loan of US$ 1,200).

Her 22-year old daughter is a college student and her 14-year old son is at studying at a prestigious secondary school in their city.  Both children support their mother in everything she does.  Ida Luz is also caring for her father Carlos S. who is 85 years old, retired, and at his advanced age needs the care of his loving daughter.  When Ida was in school she studied jewelry making and for a long time she dedicated herself to the art.  The benefit of this has been that she has been able to provide wellbeing and security to her children for a long time.  Despite not having an appropriate shop, Ida formed a small center, along with a group of single mothers, to impart her knowledge and teach others the art.  As time passed the group progressed and her students began to benefit medically and psychologically, thanks to Ida\u2019s friendly oversight.  Nonetheless, it all disintegrated due to her housing arrangement, and since then she has only been working at a conventional job making shoes, fine costume jewelry, and, as she is a good weaver, she makes singles, woven sandals and straps.  She longs to start another club with the goal of helping these unselfish mothers and, most importantly, provide them with amenities and materials so they can learn and contribute to a better quality of life for their families.  She also wants to open a store, and for each of these plans, she needs investment capital.  She appeals to your generous hearts to obtain the amount she requests so she may put her plans into action.

Before, her family had a very difficult time because there wasn't enough fund to invest in any business, while her children are all small.  In 2005 Mrs. L. joined TYM Fund (Kiva Partner in Vietnam) to loan some money to sell mats.  The business has been going pretty well and brought a steady source of income to her family, about 400,000VND (about 238 USD) per month.  She wants to borrow 8,000,000 VND (or 475 USD) to have more funds to invest in her business and bring more income to her family.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Vietnamese by Phuong Nguyen, Kiva

Abdurazok is 45 years old. He is married with three children. Abdurazok is providing taxi services with his car. He has been in this business for the last 7 years. Abdurazok is always trying to provide high quality services at attractive prices. He is doing his best to make his business stable and profitable as he is the main bread-winner in his large family. He is ready to work from the early morning till late at night in order to keep his customers and obtain new ones. Today he is planning to replace the fuel supply system with one using gas, as gas is cheaper than petrol. For this reason he requests $800 US Dollars for the term of 10 months. He thanks everyone supporting him and promises to repay the loan in a timely manner. <p>\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International<p>\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and its famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <p>\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <p>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.
