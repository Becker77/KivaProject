The group is known for being tight-knit.  Doris tells us that three years ago she began selling small products like rice, noodles, and milk from a spot in her house.  At first only her relatives bought from her, and then her neighbors did.  Little by little she began to improve sales and over the months the business continued to develop, but the problem also arose of her income decreasing as she extended credit to a lot of people, which diminished her inventory.  \r\n\r\nDoris used her income to complete construction on her house.  She didn't have a water tank, which is essential for cooking and housecleaning.  She also partially supports the education of her three children, aged five, fourteen, and sixteen, who go to school.

She has had her business for over eight years.  Four months ago she changed and moved her business. She started with a small butcher shop in the public market of her community. \r\n\r\nShe plans to use this loan to invest in her butcher shop and food sales (fried pork) by buying different kinds of meats. She will use the profits to repair her house and save for her future. She wants to have a better home structure and live well and quietly with her family. \r\n\r\nThis Esperanza associate began with us because she wanted to invest in her business and her story is representative of her group and of Esperanza's Haitian and Dominican clients generally (many of whom recently emigrated to the DR from Haiti). Her group is located in the rural area surrounding Hato Mayor, an agricultural area. This area, like nearly all impoverished areas of the Dominican Republic, suffers from unreliable electricity and running water (none of which is

She is 46 years old, married and has 4 school-aged children. To make a living, Lydia owns and operates a specialized retail store. The main source of income for the business comes from buying and selling generic drugs like pain relievers, anti-histamines and multivitamins in the local community. Lydia has been engaged in her business for over 9 years and earns approximately 10,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Lydia joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Lydia has successfully repaid a previous loan of 16,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional inventory and increase working capital. Lydia is requesting a new loan of 17,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional generic drugs like antibiotics. This loan will be the 6th loan taken out by Lydia from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, we created this template for our field staff to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":657178,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pharmacy","sector":"Health","themes":null,"use":"To

This time, for her 13th loan, she is borrowing 29,500 PHP, which she intends to use to buy medicines and vaccines for her hogs and paraphernalia so that she can continue to save up for the future education of her children.

Kyrgyzstan.  Similar to many families living in the rural areas, Ainagul and her husband are raising livestock, which they have started in 2009. Currently Ainagul owns 10 sheep and 1 horse. Also, Ainagul bakes vegetable pirozhki (baked stuffed buns) and sams (Kyrgyzstani buns with meat filling) and sells them at a Sunday livestock market which also brings small income into her family's budget. In order to further expand her business, Ainagul  has come to \"Bai Tushum & Partners\" for a loan of 60,000 som (KGS) to purchase sheep for fattening and resale.

She noticed that many of her clients were asking for embroidery work so she went to do some vocational training in embroidery over the last five months. Intelligent and sincere, Miss K. likes to do good work. She charms her clients by the quality of her service.

This group-lending method creates a social support network within the community as well as an accountability system to ensure that not only are loans paid back on time, but that the loan capital is invested in developing their businesses and providing for the basic necessities of their families.\r\n<\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":25938,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"Purchase jeans, wrap skirts, blouses, shorts and T-shirts","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HT","country":"Haiti","town":"Trou-du-Nord","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"19.633333 -72.016667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":44,"posted_date":"2007-04-10T17:17:49Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1200,"lender_count":27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Philoude","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-04-25T23:58:36Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1200,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":200}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":200}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":200,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2007-05-26T09:18:18Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-28T20:02:17Z","rounded_local_amount":200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":17477},{"amount":200,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2007-06-26T09:19:22Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-28T20:02:17Z","rounded_local_amount":200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":26287},{"amount":200,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2007-07-26T09:20:23Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-28T20:02:17Z","rounded_local_amount":200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35677},{"amount":200,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2007-08-26T09:21:36Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-28T20:02:17Z","rounded_local_amount":200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":46638},{"amount":200,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2007-09-26T09:21:03Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-28T20:02:17Z","rounded_local_amount":200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":58916},{"amount":200,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2007-10-26T09:21:53Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-28T20:02:17Z","rounded_local_amount":200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":72233}],"funded_date":"2007-04-11T23:58:36Z","paid_date":"2007-10-26T09:21:53Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":12195,"name":"Digxi Xiomara","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"My name is Digxi B., I work selling used clothing.

She started her store 4 years ago with some groceries, and little by little she has been expanding the business.  Two years ago she started selling menu items and breakfast.

Jean de Dieu owns a grocery store and this is his second successful year in this business. His business is open from early in the morning until late in the evening every day.\r\n\r\nAlthough Jean de Dieu has been in this business for about two years, his original investment is still too low to earn enough profit from his sales.  To end this, Jean de Dieu is requesting a Kiva loan via Vision Finance Company so that he can add cakes, cookies, and some other pastries.  In addition, he will sell foodstuffs like rice, different types of flour, sugar etc.  With this expansion, Jean de Dieu will be able to continue his life with a successful business.

He has been a tailor for 15 years and excels in sewing women's clothing and doing embroidery, which brings in a good deal of income since women are among his best customers. \r\n\r\nAs soon as he receives his loan, he intends to buy lengths of African print cloth wholesale, other cloth by the meter, and sewing notions such as bolts of lining material, packs of zippers, lace, etc., to use to make dresses and shirts ready-to-wear, to display for sale instead of waiting for orders from customers. \r\n \r\nAmong his plans for the future, he intends to open a big workshop of cutting, sewing, and training and right now he already has three seamstresses who are in training with him. \r\n\r\nHe says that being able to put aside more in savings will allow him to grow his business. He does get a lot of orders but he works hard at getting them ready on time so as not to discourage the customers. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Teresa Kramer, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":549741,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":["Conflict Zones"],"use":"purchase of sewing supplies, African print cloth and other fabrics, etc. ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CG","country":"Congo (Rep.)","town":"Brazzaville","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-1 15","type":"point"}},"partner_id":165,"posted_date":"2010-06-05T14:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":475,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ange","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-05-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XAF","disbursal_amount":250000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":13914},{"due_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","amount":14872},{"due_date":"2010-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":14656},{"due_date":"2010-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":14824},{"due_date":"2010-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":14995},{"due_date":"2010-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":15167},{"due_date":"2010-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":15342},{"due_date":"2010-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":15518},{"due_date":"2010-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":15697},{"due_date":"2010-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":15878},{"due_date":"2010-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":16060},{"due_date":"2010-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":16245},{"due_date":"2010-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":16432},{"due_date":"2010-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":16621},{"due_date":"2010-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":16812},{"due_date":"2010-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":16967}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.44},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.25},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.85},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.17},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.49},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.81},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.15},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.49},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.82},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.17},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.51},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.87},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.22},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.58},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.94},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.24}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":168.01,"local_amount":88428,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:54:50Z","rounded_local_amount":89721.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151916882},{"amount":118.63,"local_amount":62435,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:22:47Z","rounded_local_amount":63348.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159657079},{"amount":156.12,"local_amount":82170,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-22T08:14:52Z","rounded_local_amount":83372.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166871320},{"amount":32.24,"local_amount":16967,"processed_date":"2010-09-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:15:40Z","rounded_local_amount":17215.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172138031}],"funded_date":"2010-06-05T17:50:26Z","paid_date":"2010-10-15T10:15:40Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":209705,"name":"Mom","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Mom N. lives in Trapeang Kabbas village in the Takeo province.

The members of this group were referred to Fundaci\u00f3n Mujer by an acquaintance in a nearby village who had had a positive experience with the organization in the past. The name of this group, \u00a8Women of Faith\u00a8 was chosen by the members and to them, it signifies that each member is a woman of faith  who is optimistic and confident that she will be successful in her endeavours.  These entrepreneurs feel that with hard work and dedication, they will have great success. \r\n\r\nDuring the Women\u00b4s Empowerment classes (which accompany the issuance of all loans granted from Fundaci\u00f3n Mujer to groups of this size), the members of this group displayed exceptional interest in learning how best to manage their micro-businesses. They have acquired skills that provide a solid foundation on which to launch a small business in a way to maximize revenue and reduce costs. Additionally, the women who have been elected to the Board of Directors (Secundina, Yorleny, Carmen and Angela) possess a wealth of knowledge  and experience acquired by working with  women\u00b4s groups. This wisdom will surely be valuable as this group moves forward. \r\n\r\nThe women of this group are involved mainly in two types of productive activities : pig rearing and the production of bread and tamales. Each individual member will receive 150,000 Colones  to invest in her business as she sees fit. The women involved in pig rearing will use this loan to purchase piglets as well as animal feed. The women involved in food production will use this loan to purchase raw materials necessary for bread and tamale production. Tamales are a staple Costa Rican food eaten all year round and especially around Christmas time.  \r\n\r\nSecundina B. C. is a 54-year-old mother of 5 who lives with her husband and two children in Pococi. She is also the elected president of this group. Secundina plans to use this loan to invest in ingredients to make bread and tamales which she will sell in her community. She starts selling her products in the street at 8 AM every day, and she works until everything is sold.  A main obstacle for Secundina and other members of this group has been a lack of access to working capital, the high cost of raw materials, and difficulty securing a consistent market for her (their) goods.  Secundina\u00b4s main goal is to secure a fixed market for her goods, so as to secure a steady flow of income and to allow her to spend more time producing goods instead of spending so much time selling her products in the street. \r\n\r\nSecundina admits there are advantages and disadvantages to the group lending model. She says that the model allows women who would otherwise be denied a loan, the ability to secure startup capital. This is because many women in the Pococi community do not know anyone with a constant salary who can act as a guarantor. This debilitating factor is overcome by the group model, whereby each member acts as a guarantor for other group members. Secundina notes that a disadvantage of her group is that she fears some of the members may have trouble repaying their loans, but she is nevertheless a \u00a8Woman of Faith.\u00a8 \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2650,"image":{"id":598078,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"For the purchase of piglets, animal feed, and raw materials for bread making.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CR","country":"Costa Rica","town":"Pococi, Limon","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"10 -84","type":"point"}},"partner_id":151,"posted_date":"2010-09-12T15:20:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2650,"lender_count":67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Secundina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yorleny","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Carmen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yajaira","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Angela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Leonor","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Grace","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ester","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Isabel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-09-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"CRC","disbursal_amount":1350000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":2650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":1350000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2650}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":2650,"local_amount":1350000,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-27T09:21:49Z","rounded_local_amount":1354971.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":196970525}],"funded_date":"2010-09-13T04:38:35Z","paid_date":"2011-03-27T09:21:49Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":234287,"name":"Kyosimba Onanya Kibuga Group-Mpigi","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Fort-eight year old N.

three adopted children. He makes a living as the owner of a clothing store.  His business is well organized, and he employs one person to help him. Leonce has ten years' experience and works from 8am until 8pm every day.\r\n \r\nLeonce's business is currently too small to satisfy his customers.

The distribution of farming inputs is part of One Acre Fund\u2019s integrated agriculture package, which includes training, reliable input supply (such as fertilizer and seeds), credit and insurance.\r\n\r\nWith income from maize sales, Paul will educate his children, ensure food security and invest in livestock rearing.\r\n\r\nIn 2012, the members of Sisimukha group will each plant between \u00bd and 1 acre of maize.\r\n\r\nPaul is pictured with his group members in the photograph as shown.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":926098,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To source farming inputs, such as seeds and fertilizer, at low prices for the 2012 planting season.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Chwele","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2011-11-24T16:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gladys","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Beatrice","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Pamela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Paul","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Solomon","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-11-24T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":37800,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37800}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":425}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":425,"local_amount":37800,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-27T10:16:45Z","rounded_local_amount":38717.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315680941}],"funded_date":"2011-12-06T19:55:28Z","paid_date":"2012-11-27T10:16:45Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":365456,"name":"Julia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora  Julia    se dedica a la venta de artesan\u00edas desde hace siete a\u00f1os.\nLo que m\u00e1s le gusta de su negocio es  ordenar  sus artesan\u00edas y visitar a las localidades vecinas  para que vean su mercanc\u00eda.\nTambien tiene una tienda de abarrotes y tambien vende dulces y refrescos.\nEs soltera pero eso no le  da miedo para enfrentarse a la vida  ya que  ella sola trabaja  y maneja su tiempo.\nPidi\u00f3  el pr\u00e9stamo para comprar m\u00e1s  mercanc\u00eda como es: trajes t\u00edpicos, bolsas tejidas, aretes, collares y blusas tejidas.\nL e da las gracias a fundaci\u00f3n  por ser parte de  las cosas buenas que le han pasado en la vida.\n\n\n","en":"Julia has been selling handicrafts for seven years.

Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets; thus, they are termed not-creditworthy by financial institutions as they lack tangible collateral assets.  This leads to poor financial support, which in turn leads to poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.\r\n\r\nSELFINA buys from and leases equipment to women.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The city is a fusion of three cultures rich in symbolism, tradition, and art: Ca\u00f1ar\u00ed, Inca, and Spanish. The people are friendly and cordial, and so are the members.\r\n<p>\r\nOne member is Blanca S.. She is 50 years old and a mother of five, aged 30, 27, 25, 23, and 22. Their father acknowledges only one, though all carry his last name. Two are married and three live in a civil union. One 10-year-old grandson lives with Blanca and studies in the Ezequiel Crespo School. Their house is rented.\r\n<p>\r\nFor 15 years, Blanca has had a business selling pinchos (roasted meat on a stick), fried fish, and fritada (fried meat). She sells from the sidewalk of her house and also has city permits to sell at the Cuenca festivals. She gets along well with all the other members of the communal bank, creating a good atmosphere of work and companionship. This is her 1st loan cycle, and with the money she will invest in her business, as there are a few things she still needs. Her dream is to have her own house.\r\n<p>\r\nClaudia S. is also a member of Bella Vista. She lives in the center of the city. She is 28 years old, divorced, and has a 10-year-old boy who studies at the Archbishop Serrano Aguilar School. \r\n<p>\r\nClaudia is a homemaker and looks after her nephews to make some extra money, and also has a small bakery business. She has been doing this for three months, and took an intensive course in baking and cake making before beginning. Her products are sold only to people who order them. Her family encouraged her to join the communal bank. This is her 1st loan cycle and she will use the money to invest in materials she is lacking in her bakery. Her dream is to buy her own house.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by jeffrey hersk, Kiva

This is how Faride Carbon\u00f3 began her microbusiness \u201cMiscel\u00e1nea y variedades Fari\u201d (Fari's Variety and Miscellany).  She is a married woman with two children ages 9 and 12 who found her first customers doing manicures and pedicures, and at the same time she taught herself the art of costume jewelry through specialist magazines.  She then added this product to her business and later added sales of cell phone minutes; she was also supported by a friend who lives in the United States.  This friend sent her cosmetics merchandise and perfumes, and Faride sold them.  This was also how she added multi-use credits and gradually she has added many products like women's clothing and cosmetics.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from buying and selling daily use products such as shampoo, soap, toothpaste, canned goods  and snack foods in the local community. Raelonda has been engaged in her business for over 3 years and earns approximately 10000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2006, Raelonda joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Raelonda has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional inventory and to use as working capital. Raelonda is requesting a new loan of 5000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell like beverages and snack foods. This loan will be the 4th loan taken out by Raelonda from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines.

It also has a sizable population of Dominicans and Haitian immigrants who live in communities with very limited resources.\r\n\r\nMargarita is very excited to receive her third loan from Esperanza Internacional, having satisfactorily repaid her previous loan and taken an important step in her business\u2019 growth. She has had her business for about four years; she started it with some savings her husband had. He gave them to her to start up her business. She is running a candy shop stall, and she is planning on investing the new loan in buying snacks, juices, candies, gums, and many other products.

In 2007, Orison opened a pharmacy, from which she earns about 120 USD per month. Orison is requesting a loan of 875 USD in order to purchase additional stocks of medicine in bulk. Orison is assisted at her pharmacy by one employee and plans to increase the quantity and range of her offerings in the future. \r\n<P>\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of microcredit in Tanzania. The organization is devoted to the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through microfinance as a practical way to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women.

Lima needs a loan of WST $1000 to purchase harvesting equipment such as wheelbarrows, shovels, rakes, baskets, and knives.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 255 tala or US $106 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Lima joined SPBD.  This is her 2nd loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Lima's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Lima A. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.2 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              1.99 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation.

Her customers are women in her community and those on the move.\r\n<p>\r\nHer challenges include paying high taxes, high rental charges, and transport costs. Flooding is a problem during the rainy season as the area where she is operating is prone to floods, which destroys her merchandise. It was once a wetland. Another challenge is that of her business being seasonal. During periods when there is low demand for salons, she switches to selling cereals and legumes, mainly dried beans. She has been operating this business for the last 10 years and was inspired by the way women were moving long distances looking for salons. She has been able to improve her standards of living, provide her family with three meals daily. Her main inspiration is owning a permanent home to operate from and also seeing her business progressing.\r\n<p>\r\nBeatrice is the leader of a 4-member group. She is 28 years old and married with 2 children. They are 7 and 2 years old. The one aged seven years is in school. She rents a three-room house in which she lives with 5 people. There is no piped water and electricity. She resides and works in a semi-urban and slum area, which is in the outskirts of Kampala."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":950,"image":{"id":192648,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To purchase more beans","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Kampala","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.315556 32.565556","type":"point"}},"partner_id":112,"posted_date":"2008-09-03T19:50:54Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":950,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Beatrice","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Teopista","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nulu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ruth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-09-17T22:56:08Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":1500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":950,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2008-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2008-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2009-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2009-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":250000},{"due_date":"2009-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":250000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":158.33},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":158.33},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":158.33},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":158.33},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":158.33},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":158.35}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":159,"local_amount":251052.63,"processed_date":"2008-10-18T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-23T07:09:59Z","rounded_local_amount":255831,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":364932},{"amount":157.67,"local_amount":248947.37,"processed_date":"2008-11-17T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-21T20:06:04Z","rounded_local_amount":253685.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5334467},{"amount":158.33,"local_amount":250000,"processed_date":"2008-12-17T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-30T08:52:29Z","rounded_local_amount":254758.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9955659},{"amount":158.33,"local_amount":250000,"processed_date":"2009-01-17T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-18T08:53:53Z","rounded_local_amount":254758.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14876029},{"amount":158.33,"local_amount":250000,"processed_date":"2009-02-17T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T19:59:29Z","rounded_local_amount":254758.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20421627},{"amount":158.34,"local_amount":250000,"processed_date":"2009-03-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:28:59Z","rounded_local_amount":254758.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27115107}],"funded_date":"2008-09-03T22:56:08Z","paid_date":"2009-04-15T20:28:59Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":65503,"name":"Sopheap","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Sopheap D., 40, and her husband, Mr. Cheng-ean Hean, 52, live on an island in the Mekong River about fifteen kilometers from Phnom Penh.

She is married to Santiago, a farmer. Their eldest son, Florentino, is 22 years old. He graduated from college and is now working as a dental technician in Manila. Their second child, Harold, age 19, is currently studying to be a dental technician in Manila. Next is Myrna, age 16 and Epifanio, age 12, both of whom are studying in high school. Lina hopes that all her children finish their studies because she believes that their achievements in life are also achievements for their parents who supported them all the way.  \r\n\r\nLina is requesting a loan of PHP 4,000 from Kiva. She will use the loan to improve her rice business. She sells rice and vegetables three times a week in the market. When not in the market, she tries to sell her vegetables in their village through house-to-house vending. She hopes that, with patience, she can send all her children to college and attain their dream, which is to finish their studies and look for jobs. She is glad that her husband also works hard as a farmer. They strive to give their children a bright future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":100,"image":{"id":393635,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits

Together, they have five children, four of whom live with them: Joel (22), Isabel (18), Nelida (16) and Pa\u00fal (11).\r\n\r\nHer day begins early, as she wakes up eager to work her land planting potatoes with the help of her husband and her children. The work Elizabet does is difficult as the harvest requires constant attention. She knows this and is constantly worried about future harvests since they will be the sustenance of her family for the season. \r\n\r\nAgriculture techniques in the sierras of Peru are passed down from generation to generation. This is how Elizabet learned to work the land at a young age. Today, her motivation is providing a future for her family. At the end of the harvest, she sells everything at a good price to wholesalers. Looking to the future, Elizabet would like to sow and harvest in larger quantities, and not only potatoes but other produce as well. \r\n\r\nThis is Elizabet's sixth loan with Kiva partner MFP and she is confident she will make her payments timely since she is responsible and does not want to lose face with anyone or with her community bank and its members, hardworking people like her. With the loan, she will buy fertilizers and pesticides to protect her land from pests and ensure a fruitful harvest.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Violeta Rubiani, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":453943,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Buying fertilizer and pesticides","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-12-21T21:50:19Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elizabet","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-11-26T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":350}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":350,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2010-07-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:36:36Z","rounded_local_amount":1008,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159672756}],"funded_date":"2009-12-22T20:12:37Z","paid_date":"2010-08-15T11:36:36Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Violeta Rubiani","image":null}},{"id":168208,"name":"Siua","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Siua L. is 34 and single with no children.

The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.

Anipa is 40. She has a big family that consists of her, her husband and four children. Anipa lives in the city of Karabalta, which is 60 kilometers to the west of Bishkek, the capital of Kyrgyzstan. \r\n\r\nOne of the main life priorities for Anipa has been to give all her children a proper education so that they have more favorable opportunities in their lives. To provide it, they saved their earnings and invested in purchasing a calf. Gradually, they increased the total population of livestock and began selling milk. Now, Anipa can boast about what a good household she and her husband together operate. \r\n\r\nTheir eldest daughter has become a schoolteacher herself, and she is just 20. Two other children are still attending a secondary school. The little son is just 5 and stays at home by Anipa\u2019s side. Raising livestock has been the main source of income for Anipa and her family for 25 years. And due to it, Anipa has been successfully raising her children and satisfying her daily needs. \r\n\r\nRecently, Anipa has applied for this loan. The reason for that is that for the rest of the winter season, Anipa urgently needs coal for heating her house. However, her monthly income of $73 does not allow her to make this purchase. Therefore, she hopes to obtain this loan and be able to buy coal. \r\n\r\nAnipa\u2019s partners:\r\n\r\nTemirbek, 56, is the father of four children. His wife is unemployed. Temirbek is engaged in breeding cattle and selling milk. He needs a loan to buy a piece of land for his son. His son is married and needs to build his own household.\r\n\r\nFlyura, 43, is a housewife. She keeps a household and sells milk. Her husband works as a welder. Together they are raising five children. Flyura needs to obtain this loan to be able to attend a funeral of a close relative of hers. \r\n\r\nDinara, 38, is a mother of five children. Her husband and elder children support the family by keeping sheep. They have applied for this loan to purchase furniture.\r\n\r\n<b>Where Did This Loan Come From?<\/b>\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance, a young and ambitious socially-focused MFI in Kyrgyzstan.\r\n\r\nMol Bulak Finance is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development on the basis of 3-Ps concept: People (building human capital and taking care of its customers and the society as well), Profit (to be profitable to grow further) and the Planet (taking care of the environment).

He and his entire family live in a house with seven rooms in Ndamukong. This very hard working man joined GHAPE in 2008. H. has encountered some problems in life, such as the death of his father, mother, brother and child in 1992. He was also regrettably unable to continue school, which he loved so much. He became frustrated after he dropped out of school. Thanks to GHAPE, which was created at the time when he most needed it, H. resorted to thinking about going into business. He joined GHAPE and collected his first loan of 37,500 XAF to begin farming and selling firewood. \r\n\r\n<p>As a young talented man, even though things are not moving well with his family since his wife has undergone surgery, he is determined to make it in life. With the skills and trainings received from GHAPE, he has been able to improve his living standards. He farms and runs his firewood business for a living. He plans to invest this loan in buying firewood and seedlings along with feed for his piglets, bought with previous loans.\r\n\r\nH. has been quite successful in the past with his business and is now earning good profit from it due to the fact that he has lots of experience. Part of his profits from this loan will be used to take care of his children, buy necessities for the family and get good medication for them whenever they are sick.\r\n\r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon.  GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach.

Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement.

She earns her living by operating two business ventures:  hog raising and swine raising. Her husband, Charlie V., who is 56 years old, works as a hog raiser to earn his living. They have two children who are 26 and 27 years old. \r\n\r\nErna joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1999 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 20 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Erna has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 21,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 14,000, raising the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 21st loan, she is borrowing PHP 21,000, which she intends to use as additional working capital so that she can continue to save up for their future and to improve their living conditions. Erna V. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest

And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.
