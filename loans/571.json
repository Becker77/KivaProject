She is a cheerful woman, and above all hard-working.  She likes to be doing all types of work to be able to generate any income she can for the household.  Sonia buys and sells animals; work she has been doing for two years now.  She goes to the small farms and rural settlements far from the city, looking for animals such as ducks, chickens, pigs etc., to buy and bring to the city to sell.  \r\n\r\nThis work is very profitable, since there are times you can even double your investment.   What she doesn't like about her work is that she has to go by herself, and be away from her children for days at a time.  However, what she likes is that she earns a good amount of money and there are also times when she can spend whole days with her children.  \r\n\r\nA little while ago, she decided to pursue a new idea, that of going to a place, some distance from the city, where her relatives have convinced her that she can extract gold through artisanal means.  So she is hoping to enter this business in the next few weeks. \r\n\r\nThis is the third loan between Sonia and MFP. She is happy, and and thankful that they will give her a loan with less paperwork, and especially because they will teach her how she can use her money in the best way.

She lives with her two children, Stif, and Paola, in a rented house, located in Palian district. Despite being on her own, she works hard for her children's future, as she loves them very much.  Her main livelihood is raising cows, which she fattens and breeds, to then sell at a good price. She now has ten cows, and wants to add to her herd. \r\n\r\nEverything she has is thanks to her parents, who look after her cattle in her native village of Huari, where she travels whenever she can.  She also has to look after her grocery store, that she opened a little while ago in a rented space in the city where she lives. The reason she moved was her children's schooling, as she wants teachers for their level, and a more comfortable life for them, as they are her only companionship.  \r\n\r\nShe belongs to the \"Huari\" solidarity group, and this is her second loan with MFP.  She is hoping for your contribution, so that she can make her plans a reality. Moreover, she promises to fulfil her instalment payments.

Today, BRAC has emerged as an independent, virtually self-financed paradigm in sustainable human development. It is one of the largest Southern development organizations employing over 100,000 people, 61% of which are women, and working with the twin objectives of poverty alleviation and empowerment of the poor. Diagnosing poverty in human terms and recognizing its multifaceted nature, BRAC approaches poverty alleviation with a holistic approach.\r\n<br><br>The successes of BRAC in the international development arena have stimulated a series of discussions, both with African delegations, who have visited BRAC programs, and with donors who work in Asia and Africa. Both the African countries and the donors have encouraged BRAC to join the development campaign in Africa to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and more recently to join the campaign of \u201cending poverty\u201d, which is an area where Africa represents the greatest global challenge.\r\n<br><br> In Uganda, BRAC registered as a Non Government Organization (NGO) in January 2006 to undertake programs in Education, Health, Water & Sanitation, Agriculture & Livestock and Microfinance. The Microfinance and Education are the pioneer programs launched in Uganda and, as of July 2007, had served 21,273 borrowers and enrolled 1,155 adolescents in its education

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She has worked day to day, breeding cattle and sheep for several years, but a year ago she started a pig farm that she periodically sells in the livestock fair in her region.  In order to have good earnings, her animals have to have a good weight.  This is achieved through good nutrition, for which she grazes her animals every morning at a distance of 3 hours by foot from her home.  She returns in the afternoon.  For Doris, this activity is usually a distraction because she goes to the countryside to breathe fresh air, and she is accustomed to this routine.  For the future, she hopes to increase the quantity of animals in order to have more working capital.  This is the second time that Doris has had a loan with MFP.  She is very determined to continue working for the well-being of her family and also of the other members of her community bank.

Filifili is now requesting a new loan of 1700 WST which will be used for the same reason.  The loan will be her fifth from SPBD.  Filifili plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family.\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD:\r\n\r\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.

D. C. is an active woman who lives in the neighborhood of Buenos Aires.  She enjoys Carnival season, the time of year when a picturesque atmosphere sets the background for the most important cultural festival in the city.  The <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Barranquilla_Carnival\" target=\"_blank\" >Carnival of Barranquilla<\/a> is also one of the happiest occasions in Colombia.  Its popular and carefree style reflects the youthful spirit and creativity of the people of Barranquilla, making it an essential part of the Caribbean.\r\n<p>  \r\nOnce the Christmas holidays are over, Elva Mar\u00eda and her daughter begin organizing her home business with all the decorations pertaining to Carnival, a mixture of the modern with the more traditional type that reflects the event\u2019s origins.  The tradition of Carnival was brought to the Americas from Spain and continues to promote the spirit of renewal and change that inspired this holiday season in Europe.\r\n<p>\r\nIn addition to being known for her cheerful personality, Elva Mar\u00eda is an enterprising woman who prepares snacks such as fried foods maD. of flour, <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Arepa\" target=\"_blank\" >arepas<\/a> (flatbread served with various fillings or toppings), and cariba\u00f1olas (dumplings maD. of cassava and potato dough, stuffed with meat and vegetables).  She sells these snacks to stores and individually to neighbors in her area.  Elva Mar\u00eda also has a retail shop in her home that is stocked with stationery and various seasonal accessories worn by women and girls.\r\n<p>\r\nHer snack business was a tradition passed on to her by her mother, who also prepared these same products for sale.  Elva Mar\u00eda has added the most delicious desserts to her offerings, as she loves the art of cooking.  She also sells <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Sancocho\" target=\"_blank\" >sancocho<\/a> (a traditional soup), but she noticed that many people in the neighborhood started prospering, so she suspended selling food temporarily so that she could open and organize the retail shop in her home.  When this business started, her husband Joaquin C. traveled frequently for work since he was employed by a shipping company.  Running a home business helped to make her feel that she was not alone.  Today, her husband is retired and enjoys a peaceful and happy life.\r\n<p>\r\nElva Mar\u00eda has received three previous loans from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo and has repaid them all on time.  She used the proceeds to purchase miscellaneous goods and supplies for preparing food at different times of the year:  Christmas, Carnival season, Easter, etc.  With the profits generated by her business, she has managed to make repairs and modifications to her home because her husband\u2019s pension was used to pay for the completion of the work.  This freed up her income to devote on other expenses such as food and services.  Their joint incomes have also contributed to the success of her business.  Her next loan in the amount of 2,000,000 COP will be used to stock her store with school supplies.  She also plans to sell drinks, such as delicious and healthy juices, and popsicles maD. with milk and fruit and packed in plastic bags.  Her customers will soon be able to taste these delightful treats in order to cool down from the high temperatures experienced on the Coast.\r\n<p>\r\nElva Mar\u00eda\u2019s goal for her family in the midterm is to acquire a place at a commercial site so that she can use her home for storing the display cases that hold the merchandise displayed before customers.  Her short-term goal is to buy a hot dog cart with a canopy; a bread and sausage steamer; inserts with lids for keeping onions, cheese, and potatoes; stainless steel containers for holding sauces; and an interior cupboard for storing bread.   These items will be installed at the entrance of her business, which is already known for selling food and hosting the most anticipated costume party for the residents of the neighborhood, the famous \u201cLunes D. Carnaval\u201d that occurs on the third day of Carnival season.   The party starts with the appearance of a large pick-up truck equipped with a sound box, six loudspeakers, two columns, three machines, eight transistors, an equalizer, and a three CD disk changer.  The group \u201cEl Millo\u201d begins the festivities with traditional Caribbean folk music.  In this district of Barranquilla, this annual neighborhood tradition is now known as \u201cthe Party with the Cuetos\u201d, named after Elva Mar\u00eda\u2019s family.  The attendees of this great rumba festival only pay for the food and beverages offered by Elva Mar\u00eda, so she is able to enjoy the party and still earn a little money.<br \/><p><strong>Translated

He also earns income from running a small barbershop in his town. Wycliffe currently employs two other men to assist him on his farm and he says that his main challenges now are the unpredictable climate and high prices of drugs for his tomato crops.\r\n\r\nWycliffe has completed two previous loans with Juhudi Kilimo for Kes 25,000 and Kes. 40,000 and has now requested this loan for Kes. 80,000 to purchase a posho mill. A posho mill is a machine that grinds maize for easier consumption and packaging for sale. He says that the extra income from this loan will help him cover all of his children's school fees throughout their education. In the future, Wycliffe wants to become a large-scale dealer in tomatoes, buying produce from other surrounding farms and becoming a main supplier to the local markets.\r\n\r\nWycliffe said that

She is married and has two children, aged 4 and 1. In 2000, she established her vegetable farming business. Working seven days a week and five hours a day, she supports her family. She has already received and successfully repaid two loans from Patan BPW and used her most recent loan to buy seeds and fertilizers for her farm. In the future, Tara plans to raise the economic conditions of her family. She thanks you for your support. \r\n\r\nOver 70 percent of Nepal's economy is agricultural.  Typically, Nepali households grow crops on small plots of terraced land. Rice (bhat), lentils (daal), and vegetables (thakari) are the staples of the Nepali diet. With a Kiva loan, BPW's borrowers are able to purchase greater amounts of seed and fertilizer.  With more seeds and fertilizer, a borrower is able to grow cash crops to be sold in the local market. Such crops allow households to move beyond subsistence and provide much-needed cash income throughout the year.\r\n\r\nThis loan was administered by Kiva's local partner MFI (microfinance institution), Patan Business and Professional Women. Patan BPW became Kiva's first field partner in Nepal in 2007.  Patan BPW operates throughout the Kathmandu Valley, offering micro-credit and business training programs to low-income women. In addition to providing economic opportunity to their clients, Patan BPW seeks to empower Nepali women within the home and community.

This group is located in a batey (a sugarcane company town) in the rural area surrounding La Romana, where the sugarcane harvest and tourist industry dominate the economy and most of the people are Haitian immigrants. This area, like nearly all impoverished areas of the Dominican Republic, suffers from unreliable electricity and running water (none of which is potable). \r\n\r\nHe is excited to be taking out his third loan with Esperanza after having successfully repaid his previous loan and grown his business. Renold plans to use this loan to invest in his business by buying rice, beans, sugar, canned food, vegetables, etc., He is running a colmado, a small grocery store. \r\n\r\nRenold makes his home in a simple structure with his long-term partner and three children.

Every day, from early in the morning, he drives round the streets of the city looking for passengers.  He can work approximately 10 hours a day and he believes that he is doing well because he treats his customers in a friendly and respectful way.\r\n\r\nFaustino is very grateful to Kiva lenders because, thanks to their help, he will be able to improve his home.  He would like to be able to build a bathroom for his household.  This will improve the conditions in Faustino's home and it will become safer for both him and his family.

Today, BRAC has emerged as an independent, virtually self-financed paradigm in sustainable human development. It is one of the largest Southern development organizations employing over 100,000 people, 61% of which are women, and working with the twin objectives of poverty alleviation and empowerment of the poor. Diagnosing poverty in human terms and recognizing its multifaceted nature, BRAC approaches poverty alleviation with a holistic approach.\r\n<br><br>The successes of BRAC in the international development arena have stimulated a series of discussions, both with African delegations, who have visited BRAC programs, and with donors who work in Asia and Africa. Both the African countries and the donors have encouraged BRAC to join the development campaign in Africa to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and more recently to join the campaign of \u201cending poverty\u201d, which is an area where Africa represents the greatest global challenge.\r\n<br><br> In Uganda, BRAC registered as a Non Government Organization (NGO) in January 2006 to undertake programs in Education, Health, Water & Sanitation, Agriculture & Livestock and Microfinance. The Microfinance and Education are the pioneer programs launched in Uganda and, as of July 2007, had served 21,273 borrowers and enrolled 1,155 adolescents in its education

All of these items are very expensive.  \r\n\r\nNow, Gina has requested 35,000 PHP as additional working capital for her business.

With the support of KIVA lenders, Gina hopes to improve the standard of living for herself and her family and lift them out of poverty. \r\n \r\nShe dreams of having a permanent space in the marketplace where she can sell her food in order to earn a much larger income.

Con el apoyo de este prestamo podra mantener la misma afluencia de clientes que visitan su pulperia porque tendra lo que ellos necesitan comprar para su hogar.

Her husband helps her tend to the store while she takes care of household chores.  She is open for business from 6am until 9pm.  Her greatest advantage is that her grocery store is the best stocked in the entire neighborhood and this leads to her having a large customer base.\r\n\r\nShe needs the loan she requested to better stock the store with a larger variety of items that form a family\u2019s basic grocery cart.  Support from the loan will make it possible for her to retain her customers that visit her store because she\u2019ll have everything they need to buy for their homes.\r\n\r\nHer challenge is reaching a point of economic stability that will permit her to start saving in order to buy a house because she is currently renting.  \r\n\r\nHer dream is to become a mother so she plans to adopt two small children and continue to work every day to support them and give them good living conditions.\r\n\r\nShe has been a FEMA client for two cycles and has shown punctuality and responsibility in her repayments and expects to continue to do so.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":686585,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Products Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To buy assorted groceries.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"Juticalpa","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15 -86.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":168,"posted_date":"2011-01-06T17:20:11Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":800,"lender_count":26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lesbia Danubia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-12-21T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":15000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2011-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2011-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2011-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2011-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2011-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2011-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2011-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2011-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2011-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2011-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2011-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":1250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.66},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.66},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.66},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.66},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":1250,"processed_date":"2011-01-24T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T03:07:00Z","rounded_local_amount":1259.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191414832},{"amount":66.66,"local_amount":1250,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-21T08:06:55Z","rounded_local_amount":1259.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195833448},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":1250,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-05T08:05:58Z","rounded_local_amount":1259.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201275994},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":1250,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-02T08:15:24Z","rounded_local_amount":1259.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206143306},{"amount":66.66,"local_amount":1250,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-29T07:51:31Z","rounded_local_amount":1259.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211216249},{"amount":466.67,"local_amount":8750,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T10:59:31Z","rounded_local_amount":8817.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216494631}],"funded_date":"2011-01-07T20:48:35Z","paid_date":"2011-07-15T10:59:31Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":267556,"name":"Ahmed","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ahmed is a young man from Bethlehem, he shares taking care of the household expenses and his 6 members family with his sisters and brothers.

However, she wanted to do something for her family, especially after her marriage, and that is why she started her tailoring business. She makes clothes and sells them in bazaar. When she first started her business, she didn\u2019t have enough money. Therefore, her production was small, and she made little money.

Today, BRAC has emerged as an independent, virtually self-financed paradigm in sustainable human development. It is one of the largest Southern development organizations employing over 100,000 people, 61% of which are women, and working with the twin objectives of poverty alleviation and empowerment of the poor. Diagnosing poverty in human terms and recognizing its multifaceted nature, BRAC approaches poverty alleviation with a holistic approach.\r\n<br><br>The successes of BRAC in the international development arena have stimulated a series of discussions, both with African delegations, who have visited BRAC programs, and with donors who work in Asia and Africa. Both the African countries and the donors have encouraged BRAC to join the development campaign in Africa to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and more recently to join the campaign of \u201cending poverty\u201d, which is an area where Africa represents the greatest global challenge.\r\n<br><br> In Uganda, BRAC registered as a Non Government Organization (NGO) in January 2006 to undertake programs in Education, Health, Water & Sanitation, Agriculture & Livestock and Microfinance. The Microfinance and Education are the pioneer programs launched in Uganda and, as of July 2007, had served 21,273 borrowers and enrolled 1,155 adolescents in its education

She chose this business since her village is quite isolated from urban areas, therefore, the villagers have hard time obtaining daily household needs.  She sells daily needs like rice, spices, soap and various snacks.  \r\n\r\nShe opens her kiosk at 7 am and closes it at 6om.  She earns about $4 each day.  As her business grow, her clients are requesting that she carries more merchandise, such as kerosene and farm feeds. Ni Nengah Juni Astuti wants to fulfill these requests and grow her business.  Hoerver she does not have sufficient capital.  So she applied for a $330 loan from DINARI. With this additional funding, Ni Nengah Juni Astuti plans to increase her merchandise offering and renovate her kiosk.  She is optimistic that her business will grow significantly.\r\n\r\n<p><b> Translated from Indonesian by Kresna Hartandi, Kiva Volunteer <\/p><\/b>\r\n\r\nSetelah menikah dengan Putu Purnawa 4 tahun yang lalu, Ni Nengah Juni Astuti    mulai membuka warung kecil di depan rumahnya.Usaha ini dipilih Ni Nengah Juni Astuti karena di dusun tempat tinggalnya, merupakan salah satu dusun yang sangat terpencil yang jauh dari perkotaan sehingga masyarakat di tempat ini sangat sulit untuk membeli barang- barang kebutuhan sehari-hari. Barang yang dijual adalah segala kebutuhan rumah tangga seperti beras, bumbu dapur, deterjen, sabun mandi dan aneka makanan kecil.\r\n           Mulai pukul 07.00 pagi Ni Nengah Juni Astuti membuka warungnya dan tutup pada pukul 18.00 sore. Keuntungan rata rata yang di peroleh per harinya sebesar Rp. 35.000.- Seiring dengan perkembangan dan juga banyaknya permintaan dari pelanggan akan keperluan yang lain seperti minyak tanah dan pakan ternak khususnya ternak babi , Ni Nengah Juni Astuti bermaksud mengembangkan lagi usaha warungnya. Namun karena dana yang di miliki tidak cukup, Ni Nengah juni Astuti mencari pinjaman ke Dinari sebesar Rp 3.000.000,- .Dengan tambahan modal ini Ni Nengah Juni Astuti akan menambah barang daganganya dan memperbaiki kondisi warungnya agar lebih baik lagi. Ni Nengah Juni Astuti optimis usahanya akan berkembang

This is 34-year-old Geraidina Mwambo from Mwanza. She is married with four children between the ages of four and 15 years old. Additionally, she supports one dependent orphan. Geraidina has been running a clothes business since 1993. She sells traditional clothing worn by Tanzanian women, called kanga and vitenge. The kanga is a piece of printed cotton fabric often with a border along all four sides. It is printed using the silkscreen method with its pattern in frames. Kitenge (the Swahili plural is vitenge) is a cotton fabric with wax print, printed by using rotary printing machines. Kitenge is an expressive textile: the various colors, patterns, writings and symbols represent moods, feelings, cultures, and traditions of native African people. Geraidina works at the business for eight hours per day,five days per week. Geraidina currently earns about 325 USD from her business. She is requesting a loan of 500 USD in order to buy more clothes to sell. In the future, she plans to expand the business. Geraidina thanks you for your support!\r\n<P>\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of microcredit in Tanzania. The organization is devoted to the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through microfinance as a practical way to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets; thus, they are deemed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and hence poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":225115,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"To buy more clothes for resale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mwanza","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.516667 32.9","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-11-19T14:30:37Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Geraidina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-11-26T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2008-12-26T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T09:04:41Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9970774},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-01-25T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:15:20Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14886991},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-02-24T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:03:54Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20436251},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-03-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:56:40Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130523},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-04-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:24:58Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027320},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-05-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:13:56Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613336},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-06-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:01:56Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010419},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-07-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:38:35Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63232730},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-08-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:52:37Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73664546},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-09-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T02:46:12Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87105277}],"funded_date":"2008-11-19T19:44:37Z","paid_date":"2009-10-16T02:46:12Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jason Groce","image":null}},{"id":78255,"name":"Evelio Antonio","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El Sr. L. soltero, de 43 a\u00f1os de edad, Ingeniero Agronomo, trabaja en la Alcaldia de Juigalpa como responsable de Desarrollo Rural Integral desde hace 8 a\u00f1os, tiene 2 hijas estudiando una el 4to a\u00f1o de secundaria y la otra el 2do a\u00f1o de universidad, su esposa no trabaja esta como ama de casa al cuido de sus hijas y del hogar.

She now has three children who are her greatest treasure. She and her husband managed to obtain a house in which they could offer their young ones safety and stability. Her thirst for progress drove her to partake in several business activities throughout her life, finally settling on cosmetology 2 years ago. This was one of the businesses that brought in the most profits for her because she only invested in purchasing products, and her skills and creativity as a hairstylist were enough to make her a competent person. After a few months passed and she realized that her services were in demand, she took the initiative to set up a beauty salon, but she did not have enough funds to do so. Nevertheless, her husband materialized her dream by converting the first floor of their home into the beauty salon that she needed. Since then, things have improved because Martha now gladly offers her services all day long. However, she now needs to increase her number of cutting-edge equipment in order to work more efficiently. This is her very first loan with MFP, and she received a warm welcome from the group. Martha hopes to continue being a part of this team. The money that Martha is requesting will be invested in purchasing supplies such as dyes, hair products, and other things that she needs to better serve her customers. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Elizabeth Casian, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":286896,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty Salon","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"Purchase beauty supplies","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-03-17T06:40:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":200,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Martha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-02-17T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":600,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":90.35},{"due_date":"2009-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":93.5},{"due_date":"2009-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":97.07},{"due_date":"2009-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":101.58},{"due_date":"2009-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":106.97},{"due_date":"2009-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":110.53}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":30.12},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.17},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.36},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.86},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.66},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.83}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":30.12,"local_amount":90.35,"processed_date":"2009-03-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:38:17Z","rounded_local_amount":96.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27117235},{"amount":31.16,"local_amount":93.5,"processed_date":"2009-04-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:47:32Z","rounded_local_amount":100.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36012151},{"amount":32.36,"local_amount":97.07,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T01:01:08Z","rounded_local_amount":104.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44595736},{"amount":33.86,"local_amount":101.58,"processed_date":"2009-06-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:42:13Z","rounded_local_amount":108.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52989999},{"amount":35.67,"local_amount":106.97,"processed_date":"2009-07-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:43:32Z","rounded_local_amount":114.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63211132},{"amount":36.83,"local_amount":110.53,"processed_date":"2009-08-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:24:13Z","rounded_local_amount":118.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73640639}],"funded_date":"2009-03-17T08:04:53Z","paid_date":"2009-09-15T19:24:13Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Elizabeth Casian","image":845142}},{"id":98735,"name":"Joana","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Joana C. is 30 years old, single, and the mother of two kids who are currently in school.

R.\r\nFor six years she has been selling popular consumer products, bicycle replacement parts, and she has a mill to grind corn.  These businesses have generated income to cover the personal necessities for her and her daughter.  This helps her husband with the household expenses.  Her husband works in agriculture and is a farmer.  Agriculture and farming drive the development of the community.\r\n\r\nNohemiu del Carmen R.\r\nShe has been selling cosmetics for over two years.  She has now gained experience in managing the business.  She buys more products and gets better earnings, which help improve living conditions for her and her family.\r\n\r\nSanto Julian L.

She has a young daughter.\r\n\r\nThe loan she is asking for will be used to buy office supplies and toys for the store because, since it\u2019s in front of a school, she has pending orders for these kinds of items.\r\n\r\nShe is very grateful to the institution for the support given.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":599304,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bookstore","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To buy school supplies and toys.\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"La Paz","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.5 -68.15","type":"point"}},"partner_id":110,"posted_date":"2010-09-13T18:50:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1200,"lender_count":45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Betty \t\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-08-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1200,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":1200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":81.78},{"due_date":"2010-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":106.49},{"due_date":"2010-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":110.59},{"due_date":"2011-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":113.68},{"due_date":"2011-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":118.21},{"due_date":"2011-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":125.49},{"due_date":"2011-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":127.21},{"due_date":"2011-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":134.04},{"due_date":"2011-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":138.3},{"due_date":"2011-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":144.21}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81.78},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":106.49},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":110.59},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":113.68},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":118.21},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125.49},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":127.21},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":134.04},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":138.3},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":144.21}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":81.78,"local_amount":81.78,"processed_date":"2010-10-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T13:39:04Z","rounded_local_amount":81.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177394026},{"amount":106.49,"local_amount":106.49,"processed_date":"2010-11-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T13:48:54Z","rounded_local_amount":106.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182532469},{"amount":224.27,"local_amount":224.27,"processed_date":"2011-01-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T02:58:48Z","rounded_local_amount":224.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191412438},{"amount":118.21,"local_amount":118.21,"processed_date":"2011-02-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-25T09:15:33Z","rounded_local_amount":118.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195830865},{"amount":125.49,"local_amount":125.49,"processed_date":"2011-03-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T10:52:37Z","rounded_local_amount":125.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201273227},{"amount":127.21,"local_amount":127.21,"processed_date":"2011-04-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T10:51:47Z","rounded_local_amount":127.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206140386},{"amount":134.04,"local_amount":134.04,"processed_date":"2011-05-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:03:32Z","rounded_local_amount":134.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211213320},{"amount":138.3,"local_amount":138.3,"processed_date":"2011-06-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T10:57:46Z","rounded_local_amount":138.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216491725},{"amount":144.21,"local_amount":144.21,"processed_date":"2011-09-01T06:59:59Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-17T07:57:26Z","rounded_local_amount":144.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227024148}],"funded_date":"2010-09-15T13:39:33Z","paid_date":"2011-09-17T07:57:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":234787,"name":"Rose","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rose is 44 years old and married with 6 school-aged children.

This business helps him a lot as he is able to solve his domestic problems and improve his business. Unisa wants his children to have a good education. The rise in the cost of materials - including flour and sugar and manual labor - are his major business challenges. \r\n\r\nHe serves retailers and consumers in the outskirts and in the city center. He has four laborers who do the mixing of the flour. He buys his raw materials in Makeni and sometimes in Freetown. He usually buys his materials twice a month through his supplier's delivery van.

His two oldest children currently work along with their father with moto-taxis and the two younger children are still in school. This family has a home and five motos, three of which are used by Jose and his sons to work and the other two are rented out daily. While Jose works as a moto-taxi driver during the week, he works as a carpernter on the weekends, and in both roles he has sufficient experience and has worked like this for more than 20 years. There is a lot of business for transporting passengers by moto-taxi, but there is also large demand along the local highways. Jose's business is supported by stopping to pick up clients and also a fixed clientele. The extra income he earns as a carpenter allows him to take care of the family's finances. This current loan is for construction, and this is his third loan with an excellent history. His previous loans allowed him to purchase his motorcycles he works with now."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":74189,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Motorcycle Transport","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"Construction","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"Santa Cruz de la Sierra","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-17.8 -63.166667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":73,"posted_date":"2007-10-15T01:55:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jose","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-10-30T22:44:21Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2007-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2008-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2008-02-29T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2008-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2008-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2008-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2008-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2008-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2008-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2008-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2008-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":83.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2008-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2008-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":83.37}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":168,"local_amount":168,"processed_date":"2007-12-31T10:18:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T04:12:40Z","rounded_local_amount":168,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":105625},{"amount":84,"local_amount":84,"processed_date":"2008-01-31T10:15:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T04:12:51Z","rounded_local_amount":84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":125337},{"amount":84,"local_amount":84,"processed_date":"2008-02-29T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T04:13:06Z","rounded_local_amount":84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":145727},{"amount":84,"local_amount":84,"processed_date":"2008-03-31T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T04:13:28Z","rounded_local_amount":84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":170075},{"amount":84,"local_amount":84,"processed_date":"2008-04-30T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T04:13:48Z","rounded_local_amount":84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":196846},{"amount":84,"local_amount":84,"processed_date":"2008-05-31T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T04:14:13Z","rounded_local_amount":84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":224167},{"amount":84,"local_amount":84,"processed_date":"2008-06-30T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T04:14:34Z","rounded_local_amount":84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":253164},{"amount":84,"local_amount":84,"processed_date":"2008-07-31T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T04:15:01Z","rounded_local_amount":84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":282149},{"amount":84,"local_amount":84,"processed_date":"2008-08-31T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-09-09T01:57:04Z","rounded_local_amount":84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":312219},{"amount":84,"local_amount":84,"processed_date":"2008-09-30T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-01T07:20:05Z","rounded_local_amount":84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":342855},{"amount":76,"local_amount":76,"processed_date":"2008-10-21T01:34:52Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-21T07:09:52Z","rounded_local_amount":76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":367202}],"funded_date":"2007-10-16T22:44:21Z","paid_date":"2008-10-21T07:09:52Z","journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":25000,"name":"Plamen","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Plamen B. has worked as a radio and electronic technician in a company in the town of Montana but after the company failed he registered himself as a private agricultural producer.

This is 28-year-old Nurat S. from Mwanza. She is married with one four-year-old child. Nurat has been running a maize flour business since 2006. A typical maize business is a stand on the side of the road where maize is often piled high in baskets. Customers can scrutinize the quality of the product before purchase and can specify the exact amount they would like. Maize is very important to the Tanzanian culture because maize is used to make one of their staple dishes, ugali, which is made solely of maize flour and water. She works at the business for 12 hours per day, six days per week. Nurat currently earns about 200 USD a month from her business. She is requesting a loan of 425 USD in order to purchase maize in bulk. Nurat thanks you for her support!\r\n<P>\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of microcredit in Tanzania. The organization is devoted to the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through microfinance as a practical way to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets; thus, they are deemed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and hence poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":225152,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Market","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To purchase maize in bulk","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mwanza","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.516667 32.9","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-11-19T21:00:48Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nurat","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-11-26T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2008-12-26T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:14:04Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9970777},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-01-25T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:16:02Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14886994},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-02-24T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:03:57Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20436254},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-03-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:56:43Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130526},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-04-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:24:42Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027323},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-05-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:14:21Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613339},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-06-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:01:59Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010422},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-07-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:38:33Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63232733},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-08-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:52:33Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73664549},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-09-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T02:46:08Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87105280}],"funded_date":"2008-11-20T00:20:07Z","paid_date":"2009-10-16T02:46:08Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jason Groce","image":null}},{"id":78271,"name":"Maritza","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Maritza is a member of the Azucenas (\u201cWhite Lilies\u201d) Village Bank.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She sells food.  She first worked as a cook, and two years ago she wanted to be independent.  She sells everyday in a place close to her home.  She currently needs a loan to buy tables and chairs.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the members also have their own businesses like weaving sweaters, making shoes, and selling clothes and dried food.  All of them need the loan to buy merchandise or raw material. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

They have a 24-year-old child. \r\n\r\nFelisa joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2003 because she wanted something better for her family. With the help of her past 13 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, and by the sweat of her brow, Felisa has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty. Her previous loan of 15,000 Philippine pesos (PHP) helped her earn a monthly profit of 9,500 PHP, improving the family's standard of living. This time, for her 14th loan, she is borrowing 18,000 PHP, which she intends to use to buy more merchandise to resell in her general store. She plans to continue to save up for future home repairs.

Ana Maria S. M. is a member of the Virgen D. Fatima community bank.  (Ana Maria is on the left in the photo; she's smiling and excited to be part of this new group.)\r\n\r\nAna Maria has operated a business for several years.  The first years, after the birth of her daughter, Kimberly, were tough.  She started out delivering newspapers with her husband, Don Cesar Baltazar Castro.  In order to pay the family's bills, they had to start very early in the morning because even now they have to get in line before dawn to pick up their papers.

She is 37 years old and lives with her family in a two-room brick house in the area named Basti wanikaan. She supports her family financially by making paranday (an ornament used to tie back hair). She sells them to different cosmetics shops to earn an income. She is the mother of six children, three sons and three daughters. Only her second daughter, who is 7 years old, is managing to get an education by attending school. \r\n\r\nSafia's husband, whose name is M. S., is involved in a shoe-soles stitching business. He makes contracts with different shoe making factories and fills their orders to earn an income. His business is well established and he has been operating this business for the past twenty-five years. Her three sons and eldest daughter also help their father in his business, by stitching shoe soles. \r\n\r\nSafia has applied for a loan from the Kiva partner, Asasah, for her husband\u2019s business.

R. is 43 years old and lives in the state of San Salvador, with her parents, brother and four children: Norma, Gabreila, Berenice and Francisco, who are economically dependent on Doris. For more than 15 years she has made tortillas, in an area located above one of the principal streets in the capital of El Salvador, known as Alameda Juan Pablo Segundo. She makes the tortillas both at noon and in the afternoon, which guarantees a lot of customers and high sales. This is very important to her, as it is her only form of income since she is a single mother. For this reason, she is asking for a loan to purchase maize (corn) and lime to significantly improve her sales.  \n\nMaize and lime prices have recently risen. Lime, an ingredient that is used to cook the maize, is put into the fire along with the maize. The proportion that is used depends on if the maize is being used for tortillas or for delicious traditional tamales.  Thanks to the lime, the maize sheds its shell, and is cleaned. Without the use of lime, Doris would have very grainy tortillas, and her sales would be greatly diminished. \n\nOne of Doris's biggest hopes is to help her business to grow and she is sure that with this loan she will be able to make this happen so that her family can live better.\n\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":727653,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

His family used to sell agricultural products in the central town market, where he used to work helping his parents.  Now, he has clubbed together with them in order to start-up his own business, as he now has responsibility to watch over his new family.  As a result, for the last two years he has sold corn in the same market, an activity which requires many hours of sacrifice.  At 3 in the morning he leaves the house and heads to his stall to sell his produce until midday. In this way, \u00c1ngel  maintains contact with his providers who are farmers from other provinces who provide the produce at a low price.   However, if he wants to obtain even lower costs he travels to these places to acquire better-quality produce in larger quantities.  In the short-term, \u00c1ngel wants to have a store where he can keep his goods securely.  This is his first loan with Microfinanzas PRISMA, where his commitment is attached to his economic growth, based upon responsibility and hard-work.

Her family consists of four children, Jos\u00e9 Francisco who is in the second grade of secondary school, Rubiel Alejandro who is in the fifth grade of elementary school, and Viridiana and Jonathon who are 8 years old. Delilery tells us: \"I feel very happy on account of the home that I have and the four children that God has given me.\"\r\nShe, along with other people, found out that Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad offered loans to people who have businesses, and so they decided to form a group that they called El Fort\u00edn. The reason that they gave themselves this name is that the road that goes to their community is called that. Her friends who make up the rest of the group are: Rossana Isabel and Mar\u00eda Aroly, and each has a different business. Deilery runs a business that sells tamales, sandwiches, sodas, fries, and other things. She has been running the business for one year and sells her goods in the Justo Sierra elementary school.\r\nShe is requesting a loan from Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad A.C. to buy stocks for her store, as is Rossana for her snack store, and Mar\u00eda Aroly who sells cooking utensils. She comments that her business is going very well, and it has helped her to make a profit and to help her husband with the household expenses. Sim\u00f3n (her husband) works as a mason's assistant, he feels happy and satisfied with the support he gives his wife because he believes in gender equality. \r\n\"My dream is to build my own place and, with the profits from my business, to support my children in their studies so that they have more opportunities to study and will have a better future.\"\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Alison Hynd, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":547351,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Ingredients to make tamales, sandwiches, pies.

However, reason, solid judgment, quick wit and a bit of good luck strengthen that leaf, enabling it to clear hurdles and decide independently where to stop. \r\n\r\nJumabu D. is this group\u2019s leader. Fate has already tested Jumabu\u2019s character when her husband perished. People of that advanced age usually stop fighting for a better life and prefer simply to swim with the current. Jumabu would fully deserve getting such a rest and renouncing all responsibilities. After all she has not simply been working incessantly  for years, but also  managed to bring up four children. She has been able to inculcate in her children the qualities which would allow them to be successful, so that they would not embarrass Jumabu, but, on the contrary, would make Jumabu proud of them. They have grown up hard-working and respectful of their [parents]. Now all her children work and are responsible for their own lives. Her only daughter is married and lives separately. With that, Jumabu has always been for her children a caring mother, first of all, and not some kind of boss or bureaucrat. In order to avoid being a burden on her children, Jumabu still continues to work and support herself. She does the kind of work she knows and loves\u2014raising livestock. Thanks to this work they have even been able to build a house. Now Jumabu\u2019s sense of judgment tells her not to wait until she has the means but to turn for help. She is hoping to obtain this loan and to buy a foal.\r\n\r\nJumabu\u2019s partners in the group:\r\nSultanbek B. is the father of three children. He is 51 years old. In order to support his family, he raises cattle, and his wife sells milk. Sultanbek requested a loan in order to buy a dairy cow. \r\n\r\nMariya N. is 46 years old. She is the mother of five children. Her oldest son is 25 years old, and her youngest daughter is 13. Mariya raises livestock, and her children help her. She wants to use her loan to buy a calf.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlymkan B. is 46 years old. She is taking her three children. The older children, a son and a daughter, go to college and also work. Alymkan raises cattle and sells milk. If she obtains her loan, she would like to buy a calf for fattening and later resale. \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Russian by Ekaterina Sukhanova, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":567735,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase a foal for breeding","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Karabalta","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":135,"posted_date":"2010-07-18T23:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1075,"lender_count":39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jumabu ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sultanbek","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mariya","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alymkan","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-06-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":1075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":3908},{"due_date":"2010-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":4258},{"due_date":"2010-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":4461},{"due_date":"2010-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":4550},{"due_date":"2010-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":4835},{"due_date":"2010-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":5119},{"due_date":"2011-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":5287},{"due_date":"2011-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":5585},{"due_date":"2011-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":5860},{"due_date":"2011-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":6137}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.02},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.55},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.91},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":97.83},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":103.95},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":110.06},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":113.67},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120.07},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125.99},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131.95}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":84.02,"local_amount":3908,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:35:19Z","rounded_local_amount":3926.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159670771},{"amount":91.55,"local_amount":4258,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:38:13Z","rounded_local_amount":4278.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166884422},{"amount":95.91,"local_amount":4461,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:24:09Z","rounded_local_amount":4482.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172151550},{"amount":97.83,"local_amount":4550,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T15:10:03Z","rounded_local_amount":4571.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177446573},{"amount":103.95,"local_amount":4835,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T14:57:35Z","rounded_local_amount":4858.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182585740},{"amount":110.06,"local_amount":5119,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T14:01:28Z","rounded_local_amount":5143.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188721586},{"amount":113.67,"local_amount":5287,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T04:36:02Z","rounded_local_amount":5312.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191460157},{"amount":119.45,"local_amount":5556,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T12:07:17Z","rounded_local_amount":5582.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195882411},{"amount":125.52,"local_amount":5838,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:35:19Z","rounded_local_amount":5866.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201323732},{"amount":133.04,"local_amount":6188,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:31:03Z","rounded_local_amount":6217.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206192241}],"funded_date":"2010-07-19T13:01:52Z","paid_date":"2011-05-15T11:31:03Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Katharina S","image":340594}},{"id":218431,"name":"Olga Isabel","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La Se\u00f1ora.

general store, arucera (rice mill), and buy and sell. She lives in Sitio Buragwak, Brgy. Manghanoy, La Castellana, Negros Occidental.\r\n\r\nShe has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2003 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her general store, arucera (rice mill), and buy and sell businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 6,500.\r\n\r\nRachel is now borrowing PHP 49,500 so that she can purchase more stock to sell. This will be her 14th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 40,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Rachel aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well being by following the Dungganon way.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

With this loan, Marie Louise will hopefully earn more profits, which in turn will allow her to keep reinvesting for better financial stability.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":875,"image":{"id":608180,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To expand her business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"RW","country":"Rwanda","town":"Kigali","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-1.953611 30.060556","type":"point"}},"partner_id":117,"posted_date":"2010-09-28T05:30:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":875,"lender_count":29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marie Louise","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-09-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"RWF","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":875,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2010-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2010-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2011-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2011-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2011-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2011-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2011-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":62500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":109.38},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":109.37},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":109.38},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":109.37},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":109.38},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":109.37},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":109.38},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":109.37}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":109.38,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-16T11:52:58Z","rounded_local_amount":63984.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177616884},{"amount":109.37,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:50:58Z","rounded_local_amount":63984.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182623085},{"amount":109.38,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T14:55:29Z","rounded_local_amount":63984.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188760906},{"amount":109.37,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T05:57:31Z","rounded_local_amount":63984.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191497830},{"amount":109.38,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T12:26:56Z","rounded_local_amount":63984.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195926119},{"amount":109.37,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T12:20:21Z","rounded_local_amount":63984.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201368025},{"amount":109.38,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:54:57Z","rounded_local_amount":63984.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206233037},{"amount":109.37,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T12:09:40Z","rounded_local_amount":63984.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211308326}],"funded_date":"2010-09-28T20:14:28Z","paid_date":"2011-06-15T12:09:40Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":238922,"name":"Andres","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Andres G. is from the town of Plaridel.

R. is 50 years old and studied up to the second year of elementary school.  She is a single mother and has two children: a 9 year-old son Joel, who is in elementary school, and a 37 year-old daughter called Eva.  Juana and her family live in Aserradero neighborhood, 10 minutes from the town of Acatlan de Perez Figueroa, in the State of Oaxaca.\r\n\r\nJuana tells us that she has been raising lambs for years.  She tells us that she started out with 2 lambs and has gradually been buying more with the profits that she has made.  Juana has a small pen behind her home where she feeds her lambs.  She also takes them out to graze every day so that they get to eat a bit of grass.  Juana decided to set up her own business since she is a single mother and she needed to get her children ahead in life.  She tells us that a further motive for starting out in her lamb-raising business was that there was more money to be earned in selling her animals than there was in her job as a sales assistant in a store.  This work also means she is able to spend more time with her young son Joel.\r\n\r\nIn addition to raising her lambs, Juana also sells barbecued lamb and lamb consomm\u00e9 on Sundays.  She sells the barbecued meat from her home.  She prepares orders which she then delivers.  She also tells us that her customers come to her home.  Juana hopes that, in the future, her business will continue to grow and that she will attract more customers so that her profits rise and she will be able to build a small business premises which she will adapt so that her customers can stay and eat her barbecued meat.\r\n\r\nJuana is grateful to the foundation for providing this loan as it will give her the opportunity to help her business grow."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":699142,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To raise and sell lamb and to sell barbecued meat","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Acatlan de Perez, Oaxaca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2011-01-23T22:50:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":500,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-01-17T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":6000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":881.79},{"due_date":"2011-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":947.58},{"due_date":"2011-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":969.18},{"due_date":"2011-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1020.42},{"due_date":"2011-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1064.23},{"due_date":"2011-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1116.8}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.48},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.97},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.76},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.04},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":88.68},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.07}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":73.48,"local_amount":881.79,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:45:03Z","rounded_local_amount":885.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195850103},{"amount":78.97,"local_amount":947.58,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:10:55Z","rounded_local_amount":951.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201292377},{"amount":80.71,"local_amount":968.47,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:09:20Z","rounded_local_amount":972.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206160635},{"amount":85.01,"local_amount":1020.16,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:21:49Z","rounded_local_amount":1024.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211233513},{"amount":88.67,"local_amount":1064,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:12:24Z","rounded_local_amount":1068.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216512377},{"amount":93.16,"local_amount":1118,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-19T07:47:52Z","rounded_local_amount":1123.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":222223080}],"funded_date":"2011-01-24T05:19:40Z","paid_date":"2011-08-19T07:47:52Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Oxnard","image":null}},{"id":271703,"name":"Raquel's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Raquel B. is from the village of Mabantad, Cauayan City, Isabela.

Her previous loan in the amount of 500 PEN was invested in her business of selling handcrafted items.\r\n<p>\r\nWith this new loan of 500 PEN, Neomida will invest in the purchase of 10 kilos of wool in different colors for producing garments such as scarves, sweaters, and vests.  She says that she works with a group of people that exports their products to the United States.  Her husband works in the teaching profession.  \r\n<p>\r\nHer dreams are to continue working and improve her income so that her children can become professionals.

She lives with her husband of 22 years, Oscar.  They have six children but only four of them live at home in the town of Hualahoyo.  Because of her good disposition, she has been able to face her problems with much optimism.  She rents farmland which means she has to work even harder to pay the yearly rent.  Her main crops are potatoes, corn, peas and lima beans and she cares for them with much dedication since her income depends on this.  But since she is conscious of the fact that harvest only occurs once a year she also raises small animals such as hens and sheep which she sells for a good price.  And she has a dairy cow and calf and sells milk for 2 PEN a liter which adds to her income.  She belongs to the communal bank \"Hualahoyo al progreso\" and this is her first loan through MFP which she counts on for support in carrying out her plans.  She is committed to paying back the loan on time.  She enjoys being a part of the association because all the members are responsible and very supportive.
