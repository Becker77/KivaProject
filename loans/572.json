A. is a tailor. She sews traditional women's clothing. She had been in this business for the past 5 years. Currently, she has only one sewing machine. There is a demand for her products, and that is why she wants to open a mini tailor shop. To do that, she needs to purchase more textiles and an additional sewing machine. This will help her to increase efficiency and, in turn, profits. Hadisa is 25 years old, divorced, and has 4 children. She is the sole provider for her family. For this reason, she needs to develop her business. Moreover, many residents of her town use her services. To achieve her goals, she decided to apply for a loan, which will solve many of her problems.

She began her business because she she has always liked sales and making crafts, and she decided to take advantage of these two abilities.  In January of 2000 she began selling used clothing in a traveling market, because her mother-in-law did the same, and had experienced success in doing so.  This same mother-in-law sent Maria clothing at a good price from the border cities of Reynosa and Matamoros.  Maria also makes crafts, and has been doing so since she was a little girl.  Her grandmother taught her how to make paper flowers and crowns for the Day of the Dead and later Maria went on to learn to make other types of adornments, mostly Christmas ornaments, which she learned from magazines.  She made all types of adornments depending on the season, for holidays such as Christmas, Day of the Dead, Mother's day, etc.  The previous loan that she received through KIVA helped her to purchase clothing and materials to make crafts, and to have good sales during the 2007 Christmas season.\r\nMaria needs a $325 loan which she will repay in 5 months to purchase more clothing and materials to make Christmas ornaments, so that she can offer a wider variety of products to her clients.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jordan Shanker, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":213978,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Used Clothing","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"Purchase materials to make Christmas ornaments to sell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Tampico, Tamaulipas","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"22.216667 -97.85","type":"point"}},"partner_id":16,"posted_date":"2008-10-18T19:30:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Candelaria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-11-01T20:57:31Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":4000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2009-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2009-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2009-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2009-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":800}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":65},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":65},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":65},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":65},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":65,"local_amount":800,"processed_date":"2008-12-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-17T09:07:26Z","rounded_local_amount":807.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9891789},{"amount":65,"local_amount":800,"processed_date":"2009-01-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-21T08:55:55Z","rounded_local_amount":807.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14815018},{"amount":65,"local_amount":800,"processed_date":"2009-02-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-15T08:15:45Z","rounded_local_amount":807.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20349823},{"amount":65,"local_amount":800,"processed_date":"2009-03-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T08:58:33Z","rounded_local_amount":807.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27037109},{"amount":65,"local_amount":800,"processed_date":"2009-04-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T09:35:15Z","rounded_local_amount":807.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35927535}],"funded_date":"2008-10-18T20:57:31Z","paid_date":"2009-05-15T09:35:15Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jordan Shanker","image":null}},{"id":73819,"name":"Kafui","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Kafui T. est propri\u00e9taire d\u2019une boutique d\u2019alimentation g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de puis 2 ans.

It was the location for the end of Alexander the Great's rule, and is known for its great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country, with its epic mountain passes, is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mix of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n<p>However, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the USSR, damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 per cent of the country is mountainous and only 7 per cent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands of people to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nMore about IMON Interational\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition.

It is also known for its famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists, and poets, such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi, and many others. The country, filled with epic mountain passes, is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, and boasts a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture, and Central Asian traditions. \r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 percent of the country is mountainous and only seven percent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n<p>\r\nMore about IMON International\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition.

He needs funding to buy more eucalyptus trees.\r\n\r\nThe members, in general, are grateful for the opportunity provided and pledge to repay in a timely fashion.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2200,"image":{"id":489992,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Wholesale","sector":"Wholesale","themes":null,"use":"To buy more eucalyptus trees.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Anta - Anta - Cusco","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":119,"posted_date":"2010-02-17T23:00:12Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2200,"lender_count":82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jusoe","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Julio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Edgar","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Bernardino","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Mercedes","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Augusta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Francisco Wilber","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Norma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Vicentina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-02-12T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":6300,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":2200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-14T08:00:00Z","amount":949.79},{"due_date":"2010-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":987.79},{"due_date":"2010-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1027.3},{"due_date":"2010-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1068.4},{"due_date":"2010-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1111.13},{"due_date":"2010-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":1155.59}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":331.67},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":344.95},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":358.73},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":373.1},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":388.01},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":403.54}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":331.71,"local_amount":949.9,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T08:19:30Z","rounded_local_amount":955,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128905978},{"amount":161.27,"local_amount":461.82,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T09:49:22Z","rounded_local_amount":464.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136633449},{"amount":290.65,"local_amount":832.32,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T08:48:50Z","rounded_local_amount":836.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144667871},{"amount":329.08,"local_amount":942.36,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:23:56Z","rounded_local_amount":947.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151851533},{"amount":306.07,"local_amount":876.47,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T10:14:10Z","rounded_local_amount":881.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159589889},{"amount":411.92,"local_amount":1179.59,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T09:40:47Z","rounded_local_amount":1185.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166800708},{"amount":369.3,"local_amount":1057.54,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T12:27:11Z","rounded_local_amount":1063.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188633350}],"funded_date":"2010-02-22T20:10:12Z","paid_date":"2011-01-15T12:27:11Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":181053,"name":"Jada Virginia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Jada Virginia L.

With the clothes, she travels regularly to buy them by the dozen according to how the sales are going. The loans that she has received from the Foundation have made her business grow. She pays for all of the Yanbal and Avon up front and they let her get the clothes on credit, paying according to how the sales are. By the same token, she gives her customers easy payment options.  \n\nWith this new loan that she is asking for, she will be able to buy more merchandise and also help her husband with his business.

He is 35 years old, married, and father of 3 children aged twelve, three, and one respectively. \r\n\r\nFernando studied until the second grade, after which he had to stop because his family lacked the financial resources. From a young age Fernando had to work to support himself. His first business was selling bread, and later he invested in a small commercial establishment and started selling basic goods. Today he has a larger, general store type of establishment. His monthly income is approximately 24,000.00 MT and he is able to save 2,000.00 MT. \r\n\r\nThis is Fernando\u2019s second loan through Hluvuku and his first with Kiva. His first was for 8,000.00 MT, which he used to buy supplies. He intends to do the same with this loan. In the future he would like to request another loan that would permit him to save more money so that he can later buy a vehicle to help in purchasing supplies. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from

Malika has a successful flour-selling business at the local market in the town of Isfara, where she sells an assortment of different sorts of high-quality flour. She has been engaged in this type of business for two years and within that short period has become a very successful entrepreneur. While her business is doing very well, she sees the opportunity to increase her sales by maintaining a larger inventory of goods. Therefore, Malika is requesting a loan of $800 to purchase more goods for resale.\r\n<p>\r\nMore about Tajikistan\r\n<p>\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes being a key post along the Silk Road and being the location of the end of the rule of Alexander the Great. It is also known for its famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi, and many others. The country, filled with epic mountain passes, is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and boasts a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture, and Central Asian traditions. \r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93 percent of the country is mountainous and only 7 percent of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

Consolacion joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2000 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 14 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Consolacion has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty. Her previous loan of PHP 13,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 6,000, raising the family's standard of living.  For her 15th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 15,000, which she intends to use for additional capital for her business so that she can continue to save up for the education of her youngest child. Consolacion is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means honorable).

She tells us that from a very young age, her father taught her to make the sweets typical of the region; cocadas (coconut sweets), dulce de leche (caramels), dulce de ajongoli (sesame seed sweets), jamoncillo (fudge), and alfafores (cookies filled with dulce de leche).  Since that time, she began making the sweets and going out to sell them to nearby communities such as Vicente and Tetela.

The thinking there is that as long as you have land that you can give to your children, you should have lots of children. The credit offer's father had 16 children and is considered a wealthy man. The problem of course becomes that the land is continually being divided into smaller and smaller plots. Currently, Uganda has one of the highest birthrates in the world and half of the population is under the age of 15, with no job prospects. <p>\r\nSawya operates a restaurant where she serves typical Ugandan food of beans, meat, matooke, rice.

Palm oil is a local vegetable oil produced palm fruit which has been cooked, pounded, sieved and boiled for hours. The reddish substance (the oil) is skimmed off and reboiled to expel its water content. Faustina desires to use the loan to expand her business by buying the palm fruit in bulk to be able to supply to more customers. <P>\r\n\r\nShe believes the loan assistance would enable her to scale up production to serve larger market and eventually, help improve her family finances.

A sus cincuenta y ocho a\u00f1os y con sus hijos ya mayores e independientes, ella piensa en el futuro terminar de construir su casa y abrir una tienda naturista en su casa.\n","en":"Irma has been the president of a popular dining hall in her neighborhood for 22 years. She has known what it is to work since she was a girl living in the country. When her mother sold clothing, she began selling underclothes, although she was very young. She grew up learning how to run a business.\r\n\r\nCurrently, in addition to organizing lunches in the dining hall, she also sells imported clothing and natural products. She carries out both jobs as a traveling saleswoman, and travels to various provinces to sell. She has always had the clothing business. She has been selling natural medicines since one of her relatives put her in charge of part of his work as a natural healer.\r\n\r\nIrma is a very active woman; she says that she enjoys traveling and selling her products in diverse locations. She is aware, however, that at some point she will not be able to get around as easily as she does now. At 58 years of age, with her children grown up and independent, she is planning to finish building her house and open a naturalist store in her home.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Trisha Bury, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":295334,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"Purchase clothing","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":93,"posted_date":"2009-03-29T04:40:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":300,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Irma Reyna","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-03-09T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":290,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":72.5},{"due_date":"2009-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":72.5},{"due_date":"2009-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":72.5},{"due_date":"2009-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":72.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":87.96,"local_amount":85.03,"processed_date":"2009-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T17:47:31Z","rounded_local_amount":87.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27085021},{"amount":185.93,"local_amount":179.73,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-23T07:39:22Z","rounded_local_amount":185.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44439403},{"amount":26.11,"local_amount":25.24,"processed_date":"2009-12-01T07:59:59Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T12:11:53Z","rounded_local_amount":26.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103780253}],"funded_date":"2009-03-29T04:59:46Z","paid_date":"2009-12-15T12:11:53Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Trisha Bury","image":804995}},{"id":102523,"name":"Daisy","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Daisy T. is 48 years old.

Together with her husband, Lucila cultivates the land she inherited by planting potatoes, corn, wheat, beans, and other crops.  When it comes time to harvest, she sells her products at the main market in her area.  Sometimes her customers will buy her crops by the parcel based on a determined unit of cultivated land.  Many times the prices she gets at market does not reward her hard work, but that is part of the agricultural lifestyle her family accepts and gives her a reason to continue working.  \r\n<p>\r\nThis is Lucila\u2019s fifth loan with MFP.

S. is 48 and married with 5 children (ages 6 - 15).  She owns a business venture, planting & harvesting taro for sale.  Talosia has 4 years of experience in this business.  Talosia needs a loan of WST $1500 to purchase weed-killers such as Gramoxome.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 450 tala or US $188 per week) to improve\/expand the business.  This is her 3rd loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Talosia's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Talosia S. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.3 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.6 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              1.5 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\"\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

Kuvvanjbek, a 23-year-old man who's been doing this for three years. This young man has many projects for his future, and to build his own house and family is one of them. He's good at what he does, and this is why he's been able to support himself and his whole family through his business. \r\n\r\nHis wish is to add more goods and in that way increase the range of materials and supplies to offer to his clients. Kuvvanjbek would pay back this loan and with the money earned he would be able to pay for his technical career education.\r\n \r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He is the father of four children. His main work consists of breeding cattle. This very remunerative activity enables him to provide for the needs of his family. \r\n\r\nA very ambitious man, Akmaljon would like to buy a greater number of cattle and to build a barn in which to house them, in order to ensure their safety. Due to a lack of finances, he is asking for a loan of $1,500 USD for the realization of this project. When his dream is carried out, Akmaljon will be able to have a greater source of revenue for his growing family. With your help, this will be possible.    \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is 45 years old and lives in her own home with her three teenage children and her husband Pedro (age 46).\r\n<p>\r\nFor ten years, Ana and her husband have been dedicated to farming.  Unfortunately, her husband was in an accident two years ago in which he injured his left leg to the point that he is no longer able to walk.  This situation made her work harder along with her oldest son because she did not want her family to lack anything, much less give up basic necessities.  \u201cMy son is essentially, for the sake of his siblings and his father, the man of the house.  This has not affected me so much as it does my husband, since he is not able to work.  Heber (her son) is very responsible and I am very proud of him,\u201d says Ana.  Every day, mother and child leave at 4am to head toward their farmland.  They have hired workers since they always like to see their land cleared because it ensures a good harvest.  Ana believes they have done well in their farming activities because they always plant in large numbers to obtain a more productive harvest.  She also plans to reopen her grocery store, which she had to close because she had to pay workers to help with fumigating their crops.\r\n<p>\r\nThis is her second loan with MFP.  Ana is happy to be working with her Communal Bank because at each meeting she learns how to confront different situations that are encountered as a part of daily life, thanks to the educational seminars that have been provided.  With the money she requested, Ana will be able to save enough money to purchase products that are needed to reopen her grocery store, especially sodas since they are the most profitable.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":507567,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Purchase merchandise so that she can reopen her grocery store","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Chanchamayo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.05 -75.316667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-03-17T18:50:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":550}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":550,"local_amount":1500,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:25:49Z","rounded_local_amount":1551.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172153899}],"funded_date":"2010-03-17T20:45:26Z","paid_date":"2010-10-15T10:25:49Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ronan Reodica","image":498323}},{"id":189429,"name":"David","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"David is 28 years old and married to Monicah Wairimu.

This group is made up of young members who have the desire to get ahead and expand their businesses. Juan Oscar is single, and he has just finished his studies in the field of Odontology. He wants to open his own clinic and also continue specialized studies. He needs the loan in order to open his clinic, so he can work and pay for his night classes. The other members work in a range of fields, such as making and selling pastries; selling cosmetics and clothing from a catalog; selling books or CDs; or serving customers in a liquor store. Others work in public relations, in spite of their young age. Despite the fact that there is heavy competition in all of these fields, the members know where to go, how to make contacts, and what seasons are best for each product; in short, they have a lot of experience. Some of the members will use the loan to buy specialized books; others will buy merchandise; and the publicist will use it for a video recorder. The greatest expectation shared by this group of young people is to be able to finish their studies, because many of them are working full-time in their careers due to their need to support themselves. Some of these members have worked in the past with other financial institutions, and some have worked with our institution in the past. In spite of being young, they want to get ahead, expand their businesses and become better every day. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Patricia Linderman, Kiva

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from providing transportation services to local community members. Heide has been engaged in her business for over 5 years and earns approximately 2200 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Heide joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. Heide has successfully repaid a previous loan of 13000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to repair a transport vehicle used in the business. Heide is requesting a new loan of 20000 PHP which will be used to repair a transport vehicle used in the business. This will be the 5th loan taken out by Heide from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to save as a reserve for future emergencies. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

They live in a neighborhood in the central mountains of Peru.  Since she was very small she always watched her parents working the land and preparing months ahead for the harvest season.  She learned everything she needed to know about agricultural techniques which she has put to use on her own land where she grows potatos, peas and lima beans. \r\n\r\nShe says she enjoys her work because she shares it with her husband.

She added that on weekends she also sells Mexican snacks at night like tostadas, pozole (hominy soup), tacos dorados (deep fried tacos), enchiladas, etc. Do\u00f1a Lupita\u2019s goal is to set up a stand selling Mexican snacks everyday outside a primary school  in order to earn a little more income. \r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":822706,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to sell homemade tortillas.\r\n\r\n","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2011-08-13T16:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":250,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Guadalupe","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-07-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":213.32},{"due_date":"2011-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":227.17},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":232.07},{"due_date":"2011-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":237.08},{"due_date":"2011-09-29T07:00:00Z","amount":242.19},{"due_date":"2011-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":247.42},{"due_date":"2011-10-27T07:00:00Z","amount":252.76},{"due_date":"2011-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":258.21},{"due_date":"2011-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":263.78},{"due_date":"2011-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":269.47},{"due_date":"2011-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":275.29},{"due_date":"2012-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":281.24}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.78},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.93},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.34},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.75},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.19},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.61},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.07},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.52},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.98},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.45},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.94},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.44}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":56.05,"local_amount":672.58,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-16T08:10:33Z","rounded_local_amount":674.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227201928},{"amount":39.94,"local_amount":479.25,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:11:24Z","rounded_local_amount":480.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232807520},{"amount":41.68,"local_amount":500.18,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:23:13Z","rounded_local_amount":501.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238618614},{"amount":43.5,"local_amount":521.99,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:03:55Z","rounded_local_amount":523.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244572857},{"amount":45.39,"local_amount":544.76,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:13:39Z","rounded_local_amount":546.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250784643},{"amount":23.44,"local_amount":281.24,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T10:27:22Z","rounded_local_amount":282.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257193333}],"funded_date":"2011-08-16T20:19:53Z","paid_date":"2012-02-15T10:27:22Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Diane Chaney","image":825872}},{"id":328757,"name":"Betty Beatriz","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Betty es socia del  Banco Comunal \u201cMujeres al Progreso de Juli\u201d, ubicado en el distrito de Juli, provincia Chucuito, departamento de Puno, tiene 17 a\u00f1os de edad, es conviviente y tiene un hijo.

Maria and Saul adopted a little girl named Marsella from her relatives. Marsella, who is 10, is studying at the 3rd grade in Elementary School. \r\n\r\nIn order to meet their family needs, Maria\u2019s husband runs an electronics (e.g. television, radio, tape recorder etc) repair shop business. As the income generated from the business is unstable, Maria took the initiative to sell gasoline in front of her house to support her husband in meeting their family needs. She has been running the business for almost five years. \r\n\r\nMaria intends to add more gasoline for her business after she saw the opportunity to serve people who do not have time to stand in line at the gasoline station, particularly in the morning when they should go to work and school. It would allow her business product to be sold out quickly. \r\n\r\nThis situation led her to seek a loan of IDR 3,000,000 from TLM. She plans to purchase more gasoline to sell. She hopes that TLM will assist her in improving her business.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n

She is married to a mechanic & businessman, and has 3 children, aged 13 years, 4 years, and 4 months.  Two of her children are going to school.   \r\n\r\nIn 2008, Wulaymatu established her business selling baby diapers, pants, towels, babywear and wrappers.  She began her business because when her father died she was brought up by her stepmother who did not think it wise to see her through school.  She taught herself this business, which has been her source of income ever since.  Working 7 days a week and 10 hours a day, she earns about Le 1,961,000 every month from her business. \r\n\r\nWulaymatu would like a loan in the amount of Le 4,000,000.  She has already received and successfully repaid 1 previous loan, and now requires a new loan in order to buy children's jeans (2 dozens @ Le400,000), jeans skirts (2 dozen @ Le450,000), babywear (4 dozen @ Le250,000),  and blouses (3 dozens @ Le300,000).  The balance of 400,000 will be used for transport and other costs.   She hopes that this loan will enable her to increase her monthly profits by approximately Le 490,000. \r\n\r\nIn the future, Wulaymatu plans to open a well-secured shop where she can display her large stock.  She also wants to build a house and give her children a good education. She hopes to access more help in terms of loans for her business, as it is her only source of generating income.  The rain  is a major factor for her because her stall is not well covered.  The competition is high, but she always has a regular supply of goods that customers demand.  She serves people around the town, about 20 per day.  She treats her customers fairly and respects their wishes.

She has sold vegetables for ten years at a market in the center of the city where she lives.  Each morning she loads the merchandise to take to the market with her husbands help.  Then she works all day offering her products while treating people well.  Good quality vegetables at a fair price is what guarantees that her customers return.  Vilma presents her products nicely since her sales depend on it.  She is very happy with the rhythm of work because this business is a pillar that her house stands on.  Later on Vilma would like to have a large stall of her own at the market where she could offer all types and varieties of vegetables.  This is the second time she has had a loan with MFP (Microfinanzas Prisma).  She is very thankful to be part of her community bank because it\u2019s a place to grow personally and professionally.  She is committed to continue working for the common good.  Vilma is applying for this loan to purchase more vegetables at wholesale and partly to pay for transportation to the market.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Susan Haynes, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":305435,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Increase merchandise","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"HUANCAYO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.066667 -75.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-04-20T21:40:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":500,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Vilma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-03-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":97.75},{"due_date":"2009-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":106.65},{"due_date":"2009-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":111.45},{"due_date":"2009-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":114.81},{"due_date":"2009-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":120.15},{"due_date":"2009-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":127.04},{"due_date":"2009-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":131.64},{"due_date":"2009-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":138.68},{"due_date":"2010-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":143.53},{"due_date":"2010-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":151.37},{"due_date":"2010-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":156.93}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.58},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.55},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.15},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.27},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.05},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.35},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.88},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.23},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.84},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.46},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.31}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":32.58,"local_amount":97.75,"processed_date":"2009-04-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:50:03Z","rounded_local_amount":101.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36012459},{"amount":33.33,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T00:59:21Z","rounded_local_amount":103.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44596049},{"amount":35.55,"local_amount":106.65,"processed_date":"2009-06-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:43:48Z","rounded_local_amount":110.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52990313},{"amount":37.15,"local_amount":111.45,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:46:56Z","rounded_local_amount":115.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63211436},{"amount":38.27,"local_amount":114.81,"processed_date":"2009-08-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:28:00Z","rounded_local_amount":118.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73640947},{"amount":40.05,"local_amount":120.15,"processed_date":"2009-09-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:40:00Z","rounded_local_amount":124.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87080415},{"amount":42.35,"local_amount":127.04,"processed_date":"2009-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:18:02Z","rounded_local_amount":131.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96996594},{"amount":43.88,"local_amount":131.64,"processed_date":"2009-11-24T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:56:01Z","rounded_local_amount":136.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103842112},{"amount":196.84,"local_amount":590.51,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T21:08:22Z","rounded_local_amount":611.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110733788}],"funded_date":"2009-04-21T02:51:22Z","paid_date":"2010-01-15T21:08:23Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sue Haynes","image":null}},{"id":106651,"name":"Oum","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Oum S. is 43 years old and resides in the Kampong Cham province.

He has four children.  All of them asked to be in the photo with the exception of his oldest daughter; she was embarrassed.  Once Jose Luis became a widower he moved to live in a house that was given to him by his ex in-laws.  This is because two of his children are from his first marriage.  When his wife was alive she managed a place where she sold food.  It was set up in his own home.  Now, given the circumstances, Jose Luis saw that it would be convenient to set up a bar in a strategic area of the city.\r\n\r\nJose Luis currently lives with Magali.  They have two children.  Jose Luis is very hard-working, and they are very hopeful that his new business will be successful.  The good thing is that there is no competition nearby, and there are lots of shops and stores that are close.  They hope these people from these places will be their customers.  \r\n\r\nThe loan he asked for was to buy a jukebox, but it was not enough.

M., sociologist, single mother, 1 son, member of the community bank \"Mujeres Emprendedoras-Sa\u00f1os GranD.\".\r\nIsabel V. is a sociologist by profession and she practiced this career for a number of years. She had her only son when she was 35, and she has to raise and educate him alone as the father of her child lost interest in them and started another home. \r\nShe used to work all day and her son was looked after by a babysitter. As her son got older, he would always ask for his father despite the fact that she tried to give him all the affection he needed. But that was enough, though the affection of a father can't be replaced, and certainly not with material things. \r\nWhen one of her sisters passed away, her grief was devastating and she hadn't the strength to do anything; they had been very close. This sister had left her some properties but, unfortunately, her other sisters took everything and only left her with two little rooms to live in. She did not claim anything else because it did not seem right to her to fight with her sisters. \r\nSubsequently, she stopped working and lived only on the pension that she received. But, she had her small son in her care and he was of school age and the money did not stretch far enough. At that time, one of her sisters had a small store where she rented out dresses and suits, but this sister got the opportunity to work abroad and closed the store. Then the idea occurred to Isabel that she could reopen this store and have a bazaar, as her sister had left behind some rentable garments, cloth, and other things. So, Isabel maD. and bought more dresses, and in this way she began her business and it has been going well to date. Her wish is that the business will grow and she can expand it. \r\n(In the photo, Isabel V. is in the upper left.) \r\nShe will use the loan for business capital. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1500,"image":{"id":657719,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cloth & Dressmaking Supplies","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Business capital","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Huancayo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":93,"posted_date":"2010-12-05T00:40:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1500,"lender_count":47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Isabel ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Soledad Chabeli","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yesica Magali","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Judith Esther","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dosmila Erma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sabi Isela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Angelica","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Karina Doris","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-11-10T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":4200,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":699},{"due_date":"2011-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":699},{"due_date":"2011-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":699},{"due_date":"2011-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":699},{"due_date":"2011-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":699},{"due_date":"2011-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":705}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":249.64},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":249.65},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":249.64},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":249.64},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":249.64},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":251.79}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":249.64,"local_amount":699,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T12:52:39Z","rounded_local_amount":705.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188665403},{"amount":249.65,"local_amount":699,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T02:51:28Z","rounded_local_amount":705.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191408654},{"amount":249.64,"local_amount":699,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:36:14Z","rounded_local_amount":705.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195826945},{"amount":249.64,"local_amount":699,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T10:46:38Z","rounded_local_amount":705.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201269206},{"amount":249.64,"local_amount":699,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T10:45:06Z","rounded_local_amount":705.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206136086},{"amount":251.79,"local_amount":705,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T10:58:37Z","rounded_local_amount":711.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211208585}],"funded_date":"2010-12-17T16:12:34Z","paid_date":"2011-06-15T10:58:37Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Alison Hynd","image":607121}},{"id":259103,"name":"Lilibeth's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lilibeth A. is from the village of Union, Cauayan City, Isabela.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from buying and selling daily use products such as shampoo, soap, canned goods, snack foods, milk, beverages, and food seasonings in the local community. Marcelina has been engaged in her business for over 15 years and earns approximately 10,000 PHP a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Marcelina joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Marcelina has successfully repaid a previous loan of 7,000 PHP from HSPFI, which was used to to purchase additional inventory and acquire working capital. Marcelina is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional canned goods, snack foods, and beverages to sell. This loan will be Marcelin'a third loan from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines.

However, she does not lose heart as she has other sources of income such as her five cows which provide her with the milk she needs to make delicious cheese.  She tells us that she makes, on average, 6 molds of cheese each day.  She also has two bulls which help her plow the land, five sheep which she fattens and then later sells, and a grocery store which she set up in her home and where she sells basic household products.  All of this makes her a tenacious woman who has a great desire to get ahead in life.

He is married to a trader and has five children, ages 17, 15, 13, 11 and 2 years. After fifth form, he wanted to enter college but, unfortunately for him, his father died and he had nobody to support his schooling. Therefore, he was left with no other option but to go into business so that he could earn a living. \r\n\r\nIn 1994, Osman established a business selling shirts, shorts, T-shirts, sneakers and shoes for both men and women. He is assisted by his distant cousin. Competition is high but he buys quality goods. He usually goes to Conakry twice per month by public vehicle. He serves people around town and his business is popular as his goods are always available when his customers need them. Working 7 days a week and 10 hours a day, he earns about 2,742,000 leones (SLL) every month from this business. Rise in foreign exchange is one of his major problems. \r\n\r\nOsman would like a loan of 4,000,000 SLL. He requires a loan to buy jeans (50 pairs @ 47,000 SLL) and T-shirts (50 @ 24,000 SLL). The balance of 450,000 SLL is for transport.
