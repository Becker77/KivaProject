She is unemployed, married, and has 6 children. Her husband does not have a permanent job, and is not able to earn enough money to support their family. Peata's biggest worry has been the school fees for her 4 children attending school and other basic needs for her family. She opted for starting the business, because cakes are cheap to make, and because the business would not much interfere with her busy schedule as a full time mother. In addition, pork cakes are a favourite among the locals, especially children. To start out, Peata bought flour and meat, and now makes about 40 buns daily, 7 days a week. She sells the cakes to school children during the week and to other village people during the weekends. Occasionally, Peata's husband delivers the cakes to nearby shops.  She earns up to  280 tala (US$90) a week, and is now able to cover the family's basic needs in addition to paying her children\u2019s school fees.

Faasu has been engaged in this business for over four years and earns approximately 600 WST a month.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2007, Faasu joined SPBD to gain access to financial services. Her goal was to help improve her living situation and to increase her ability to engage in business activities. Faasu has successfully repaid a previous loan of 1,250 WST from SPBD. This previous loan was used to purchase additional seeds, seedlings, and young crops to raise.  \r\n<p>\r\nFaasu is now requesting a new loan of 1,800 WST, which will be used to purchase additional seeds, seedlings, and young crops to raise. The loan will be the third loan she has taken out from SPBD. Faasu plans to use the additional revenue generated to improve the general living conditions of her family.\r\n<p>\r\nAbout SPBD:\r\n<p>\r\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.

The bank is located in one of the most beautiful places that the city Cuenca has, which is about 20 minutes outside of the city.  Being the viewpoint of Cuenca, it is visited by natives and foreigners coming here to admire the beauty of the enclosed city.\r\n\r\nTur\u00ed Centro is comprised of a group of enterprising women who have found the formula to get ahead in their households and in their businesses.  They serve as an examples of success and perseverance.  They are:\r\n\r\nGladis Esperanza I. C. is a member of the Tur\u00ed Centro Communal Bank in the city of Cuenca.  She is 43, and she has five children who are 23, 21, 19, 17, and 14.  Her oldest child is outside of the country.  He migrated to the exterior to give his family a better future.  Her second daughter is married and making her own home.  Only three of her children live in her home.  One of her daughters enrolled this year in the State University of Cuenca.  Her two last children study in the T\u00e9cnico Tur\u00ed school.  She has been divorced for four years, and they live in their own home.\r\n\r\nGladis raises small animals like chickens and guinea pigs.  She also does the household chores.  She has been raising animals for six years, and it is going very well.  She tells us that the earnings are dependent upon how much is invested.  And that can vary because not all of the chickens are raised, some die.  But, she is happy because this business supports her household.\r\n\r\nThis is her second cycle working with the Foundation, although she did withdraw for a while.  The money that she gets now from the ESPOIR Foundation will be used for food for the chickens (ground, balanced) and the guinea pigs.\r\n\r\nHer future goal is to keep growing with her business of raising animals and giving her children a better today and tomorrow.\r\n\r\nTania Paola M. C. is also an active member of the Turi Centro Bank.  She lives in the Centro de Tur\u00ed in the viewpoint of Cuenca.  She is 30 and happily married.  Her three children; 12, 9, and 7, are testaments to their love.  Her oldest child goes to the Miguel Merch\u00e1n school.  The last two goes to the Pr\u00edncipe de Paz school.  Her husband works as a carpenter.  Being her friend, they are inseperable in the moments of pain and happiness.  They rent where they live because they do not have the money to buy or build their own house.\r\n\r\nTania studied tailoring and passed to the second year.  She sells clothes two day a week.  On Wednesdays she sells in the free marked in a space her mother gives her.  On Saturday she buys all her clothing stock for her business.  One of her biggest difficulties is not having her own place.  She has to inconvenience her mother a little bit.  The advantage is that working with her mother she knows lots of people, and she gets new customers each time.\r\n\r\nThe loan she is asking the foundation for is to buy merchandise to increase her business and to have a large stock for her demanding customers.\r\n\r\nHer future goal is to be a tailoring teacher and to continue with her clothing business.\r\n\r\nElizabeth Patricia is another active member of the Turi Centro Communal Bank.  She was previously a member of another bank that broke up.  She is 39, and she has been separated for seven years.  She lives with her four children.  Her ex husband gives her child support only when her remembers.\r\n\r\nElizabeth works in the market on Thursdays and Sundays selling a great variety of fruit.  She starts at six in the morning and works until nine at night.  She has been doing this for five years.  The rest of the week she devotes to her home.  The greatest difficulty she has is when sales drop and she barely gets enough money to cover the debts that she owes.  When sales are good, she gets income to invest in her business and for the daily sustenance of her household.\r\n\r\nThis is her fifth cycle working with the ESPOIR Foundation.  She previously was a member of another communal bank that broke up.  The money she is asking for is to buy more fruit to better stock and improve her stand because there is a lot of competition.\r\n\r\nElizabeth\u2019s dream for the future is to succeed in her business and to be able to educate her children until they become good professionals.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva

It has four branches and three units with offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":125,"image":{"id":405575,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She owns a business venture, selling puletasi (Samoan formal wear).  Fagaitaua has 2 years of experience in this business.  Fagaitaua needs a loan of WST $1250 to purchase additional fabrics & materials.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 400 talas or US $167 per week) to pay for her children's tuition fees.\r\n\r\nFagaitaua joined SPBD.  This is her 3rd loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Fagaitaua's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Fagaitaua F. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.6 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.4 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.8 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2.3 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. <p>\r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:<P>\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.<P>\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

He lives with his wife and one dependent child in the rural community of Cruz del Medano in the M\u00f3rrope district.

This activity provides income to help support his family.  The income from his farming work is not enough to support his family.\r\n\r\nThis activity is well received in the area.  Juan wishes to expand his business in order to get more income and get ahead.  Therefore, he has seen the need, for the first time, to ask Edpyme Alternativa for a loan for 2,000 PEN.  He plans to use the money to buy more small animals and balanced food.  This way he plans to achieve his objective.\r\n\r\nJuan is very devoted to his family.

Jesusa has been engaged in her business for more than 14 years and earns approximately 9,000 Philippine pesos a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Jesusa joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Jesusa is requesting a new loan of 20,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional inventory and as working capital. This will be the fifth loan taken out by Jesusa from ASKI, a Kiva partner.

Gonz\u00e1lez has worked for several years in a clothing assembly shop where they pay her based on the number of pieces she produces. The wages she earns are not enough, so she does her own work at home in the evenings and on the weekends making custom ordered clothing for clients she has gained through the years. She uses a sewing machine that she obtained thanks to her savings. Delfina has been increasing her number of clients and this has generated better income for her, which helps add to the income she earns from the clothing assembly shop where she works. For this reason, Delfina would like to leave her job and open her own business. <p>To do this she needs a more modern sewing machine that can hold three spools of thread. This will enable her to work more quickly and increase her production. The machine she currently has only holds two spools, and this prevents her from sewing many of the styles people request. Delina has already decided on the sewing machine she wants to buy and it costs $350.00. If she gets the loan to finance the new machine and things go well, she is thinking of leaving the clothing assembly shop and working full-time at her own business. <p> <b> Translated from Spanish by Jennifer Day, Kiva Volunteer. <p><\/b>Do\u00f1a Delfina A.

Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets; thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":216151,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To purchase additional stocks of rice, cooking oil, and soda.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbeya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.9 33.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-10-21T15:10:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rukia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-11-04T17:52:18Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2008-12-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:06:26Z","rounded_local_amount":100440,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9970703},{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-01-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:11:58Z","rounded_local_amount":100440,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14886920},{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-02-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:01:27Z","rounded_local_amount":100440,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20436180},{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-03-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:53:46Z","rounded_local_amount":100440,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130453},{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-04-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:22:29Z","rounded_local_amount":100439.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027255}],"funded_date":"2008-10-21T16:52:18Z","paid_date":"2009-05-15T23:22:29Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lorne Warwick","image":215175}},{"id":74695,"name":"Nguyen Thi","description":{"languages":["vi","en"],"texts":{"vi":"Ch\u1ecb Nguy\u1ec5n Th\u1ecb H\u01b0\u01a1ng tham gia Qu\u1ef9 t\u00ecnh th\u01b0\u01a1ng t\u1eeb n\u0103m 2001.

Thi Nguyen has been participating in the fund since 2001.  In the first round of funding she borrowed 2 million VND to invest in raising pigs.  In the whole time in which she has been participating in the Fund, Mrs. Nguyen has always utilized the loan with successful results, making all repayments on time and satisfying all other conditions of the Fund.  Currently besides income from the livestock, her family also has an income stream from her husband's salary as a construction worker, so the family's finances are very stable.  In this round of funding she is borrowing 15 million VND, part of which go towards purchasing a sow to raise, and the remainder of which will be used to invest in a biogas system to serve the livestock operations.  The family's income is 3.5 million VND per month.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Vietnamese by Chi Nguyen, Kiva

Villagers who use machines for their business always come to him to have their machines repaired. Now, Bahodur is finding that the tools that he has are not enough to work at his job with full speed. For this reason, he is seeking a loan of $600 USD that will be paid back over the course of 12 months. This loan will be used to buy tools and materials used to repair autos.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Now that they are older, she has started working again with the help of her partner and children.  They helped her get a food cart with which she sells meals from the door of her house.  She works every day, above all on the weekends due to the great demand.  She works from 5 p.m. until midnight since she takes advantage of the customers that are out at night.  Nevertheless, Flora plans to install a store in her house where she can begin to sell clothes.  Her neighbors are beginning to make orders which she hopes to deliver shortly, without neglecting her meal-selling business.  This is her 14th loan with MFP.  What encourages her the most to continue with her community bank is the group unity and the support of all its members.  The 1000 PEN she is applying for will allow her to purchase necessary food to prepare her meals as well as clothes for her new business.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Susan Haynes, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":356305,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Increase merchandise","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-07-22T23:30:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Flora","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-07-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":147.84},{"due_date":"2009-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":156.03},{"due_date":"2009-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":163.05},{"due_date":"2009-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":169.57},{"due_date":"2009-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":178.01},{"due_date":"2010-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":185.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.74},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.61},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.07},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.35},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.3},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":64.93}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":51.74,"local_amount":147.84,"processed_date":"2009-08-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:20:11Z","rounded_local_amount":157.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73641605},{"amount":54.61,"local_amount":156.03,"processed_date":"2009-09-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:33:17Z","rounded_local_amount":165.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87081045},{"amount":57.07,"local_amount":163.05,"processed_date":"2009-10-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:03:45Z","rounded_local_amount":173.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96997195},{"amount":59.35,"local_amount":169.57,"processed_date":"2009-11-09T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:54:03Z","rounded_local_amount":180.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103842539},{"amount":127.23,"local_amount":363.51,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-19T10:53:52Z","rounded_local_amount":386.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734115}],"funded_date":"2009-07-24T18:38:58Z","paid_date":"2010-01-19T10:53:52Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sue Haynes","image":null}},{"id":127945,"name":"Etevise Mele","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Etevise Mele G.

She lives with her partner and children, for whom she works with the goal of improving her quality of life. Her business is preparing and selling sandwiches and pastries, which she makes in her house. She also receives orders from her clients, the majority of whom are her neighbors, friends and relatives. Her clients trust her for their social events, because she is known to be very gifted. What she likes most about her work is decorating the cakes, because this puts her creativity to the test.

For the past 5 years he has worked as a driver of a leased mototaxi.  (Mototaxis are motorized, 3-wheel vehicles that are licensed for the transportation of passengers).  He used to work as a fare collector on a minibus which operated on the Lambayeque-Chiclayo route.  He had to leave this employment because it did not produce enough income to support his family.  Occasionally he worked as a stevedore in the municipal market.  This income is an important contribution to his family's economic stability.  In addition, his wife works as a domestic employee in a private home.  Together they struggle daily to get ahead and progress.\r\n\r\nThe owner of the vehicle he leases is selling it.  Carlos wants to take advantage of this situation which will afford him a stable income to care for his family.  This is why he is asking Edpyme Alternativa for a 1000 new sol loan to purchase this vehicle and to pay the fees to legalize the ownership transfer and to get the necessary licenses to insure formal work.  His dream is to be able to improve his house which is currently built only in a very unfinished manner and to open a general store which will provide income which will insure his children's higher education.

She always yearned to form a stable family and to raise her son with the presence of a father.  However, this man abandoned her when he learned she was pregnant.  Since then, she has farmed her banana fields, and fields belonging to others, with her child on her back.  Sometimes, because of her baby, she takes more than the alloted rest time and some of the farmers don't want to hire her.  Because of this, Mirian wants to have her own coffee crops because this is a more profitable product and, even though she knows she will require a heavy investment, she trusts that she will be able to succeed because she wishes to get ahead and offer wellbeing for her son.  This is her second loan with MFP and, even with her very limited monetary assets, she had no problem repaying the first loan.  She is, therefore, highly admired by the members of her communal bank.  The funds she is requesting on this occasion are to buy fertilizers and coffee seeds to start a nursery.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":426317,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy seed and fertilizers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Chanchamayo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.05 -75.316667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-11-14T20:40:21Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":500,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mirian","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-10-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1400,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-14T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":1400}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":500}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":500,"local_amount":1400,"processed_date":"2010-08-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:39:17Z","rounded_local_amount":1439.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166886567}],"funded_date":"2009-11-14T23:53:55Z","paid_date":"2010-09-15T10:39:17Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":156816,"name":"Hanin","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Hanin is a young woman who is married with one child.

Ulaanbaatar, the capital city of Mongolia. Her oldest son works in South Korea as a contract worker, and he sends money to his mother. His mother recently purchased a new one-bedroom apartment with her son's money. Besides the remittance money she receives, she sells cheap shoes at Sundae Center, a 24-hour shopping mall in the busiest district of Ulaanbaatar. She rents a small stall and sells various men's and women's shoes imported from China. She says that because her stall is located in the busiest section, the business is doing pretty well. She further says that she would like to expand her business by adding more quality shoes in her stall. Her dream is to be financially able to send her youngest daughter to get the best education abroad. She requests a loan to purchase more winter shoes for her business.\r\n\r\nAbout XacBank\r\nXacBank was founded in 2001, and listed its first loan on Kiva in January 2009.

poseer bastante comercio, ya que es el principal centro de abasto para los habitantes de la zonas aleda\u00f1as, este distrito pertenece a la provincia de Lambayeque y se encuentra ubicado a media hora de la ciudad de Chiclayo.\n\nCristina se gana la vida comercializando verduras en un mercadillo de la ciudad de Lambayeque desde hace mas de ocho a\u00f1os, todos los dias ella se moviliza muy temprano al mercado Moshoqueque (mercado mayorista de la regi\u00f3n) a comprar sus productos que luego ofrece a sus clientes durante todo el dia y parte de la tarde. Como los productos que ofrece son frescos, su negocio siempre goza de mucha demanda y  ha llegado a tener una clientela fidelizada.\n\nLa continua demanda por los productos que ofrece en su negocio han hecho que piense en ampliar su puesto de venta, por ello se encuentra solicitando por primera vez a Edpyme Alternativa un cr\u00e9dito de 1500 nuevos soles que piensa invertir en la compra de verduras para lograr su objetivo.\n\nCristina es una mujer luchadora y que da lo mejor de si para sacar a sus hijos adelante, su mayor anhelo es verlos realizados y convertidos en excelentes profesionales.

This district is part of Lambayeque province and it\u2019s half an hour away from the city of Chiclayo.\r\n\r\nCristina earns her living selling vegetables in a small market in Lambayeque; she\u2019s been in this line of work for over 8 years.  Every day she goes to the Moshoqueque market (regional wholesale market) very early to buy her products that she then resells to her customers all day and into the evening.  \r\nBecause all her products are fresh, demand is high and she has built up a good base of regular customers.\r\n\r\nContinued demand for her products has made her consider expanding her stall.  This is why she\u2019s asking Edpyme Alternativa for the first time for a 1500 new sol loan to buy vegetables to reach this goal.\r\n\r\nCristina is a tenacious woman who gives all of herself to have her children succeed in life.

A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the culturA. context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. \r\n\r\nIn order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principA. loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

Previously, she worked as a secretary for a company in the city of Managua, and there she acquired knowledge and experience which motivated her to have her own business. In addition, she likes our culture and the country's rich tradition of handicrafts -- this helped her to decide on the type of business she wanted to operate. She has now worked for 6 years selling handicrafts, hammocks and picturesque paintings which are in great demand among tourists. She reports that her business has allowed her to learn about and get to know our own culture and to understand why visitors are very fond of handicrafts. In addition, this business has provided her with her daily bread and covered her household expenses. \r\n\r\nShe applied for this loan to buy handicrafts such as woven hammocks, paintings, pots and jewelry. This investment will help her expand her inventory, since a high season is approaching when many tourists come to the country, and she would like to take advantage of this to sell to them. She would like to have her own building for her shop, and for this reason she is working long and hard every day.

Anco\u201d is a small rural community bank of FINCA Peru\u2019s Wari-project which provides its credit with education services in the rural areas of Huancavelica. Huancavelica is considered one of the poorest regions of Peru and has many limitations being a very mountainous area (altituD. ranges from 2,000 \u2013 5,000 meters above sea level). These limitations incluD. the cold, the difficulty to grow crops, and the lack of an adequate infrastructure of roads and communication systems.\r\n<p>\r\nBCR \u201cLas Rosas D. Anco\u201d, is located at approximately 2,300 meters above sea level in the community of Anco, in the district with the same name, province of Churcampa. Anco is located at the border of the Mantaro river and is one of the lowest places in the department of Huancavelica. Due to its relatively low altituD., the area has a warm, almost tropical climate. The warm climate and the vicinity of the river make the area very suitable for growing fruits like oranges, lemons, avocado, papaya and mango. Besides the fruits, most of the people dedicate their time raising guinea-pigs and chicken. They also produce alfalfa, the crop that makes the diet of the guinea-pigs. The town of Anco is situated on the main road between 2 prominent Andes cities: Ayacucho and Huancayo. Business is done with both cities, and also people stopping on the road use the variety of services in town.\r\n<p>\r\nCurrently the bank is starting its first loan cycle with 10 female borrowers and a total loan of 4,800 soles (about 1,750 US$). The loans range from 200, 300, 400, 500 and up to 600 soles. \r\nBecause the bank has been formed recently, it has no history yet. The expectations working with FINCA Peru are very clear: increase business and save. For all members, the main use of the savings they will be generating now is for investing in their businesses or for the education of their children, whether to buy school uniforms, supplies, books, or even to pay the fees for entering primary or secondary school.  \r\n<p>\r\nOne of the members of the community bank is Flor D. Mar\u00eda Q. A.. Flor will receive a loan of 600 soles and has a small business selling food in a kiosk on the main road. Besides that she also raises guinea-pigs. She almost has 200, and business is going well. Her dream for the future is to have her own restaurant, to have a guinea-pig farm with more than 1,000 small animals, and for her children to study. With her savings, she hopes to open her restaurant and maybe go to a bigger place with her husband, somewhere where there is a university where their children can study, where it will be more easy to have a better business.  In FINCA Peru, she wants to learn and save more and learn to valuate herself as a person. \r\n<p>\r\nDoris Sara M. P. tells another story. She runs a small grocery store and has an internet cabin. Besides that, she serves meals to the employees of the district government.  In the future, she wants to improve her grocery store and send her children to study at the university, so they can be professionals. She would like to improve the number of computers. With her 300 soles loan, she will increase her groceries. Now that she will be working with FINCA Peru, she hopes to save more and to work more responsibly to be able to pay for her loan. She will use her savings to reinvest in her business, increasing her internet business, install a fax machine, and open her restaurant.  Now that she is in FINCA Per\u00fa, she hopes to to care for and value herself. Most women do not value themselves a lot. Fortunately now there is FINCA Per\u00fa which works only with women. She expects to receive trainings on how to improve business and how to work equally with men. (Her husband will do the cooking while she will attend the bank reunion and afterwards she will explain to him what she has learned!).\r\n<p>\r\nTabita Durcal C. A. has a small business selling an elixir of 7 seeds and is running a small grocery store. Besides that she buys and sells cereals and school supplies for the children. With her 400 soles loan, she will buy more supplies for her store. Tabita has many dreams, like improving the lives of her children. When her husband left her, she thought that she would never improve her life and get out of her misery.

Currently, Galina has about US$6,000 worth of goods in the store inventory, and her monthly income is about US$600. Previously, Galina used to work as a book-keeper, and this practical skill now helps her in her everyday work. \r\n\r\nCurrently, Galina would like to take out a short-term \"express\" loan (to be repaid within one month) to be able to purchase additional merchandise for the summer season, thus better meeting the needs of her customers. Financial assistance also previously has helped Galina sustain her business and herself, since, like most retired people, she receives a very small retirement fee which is not sufficient for covering even the basic expenses.

He is married and the father of two children, one of whom attends school. He is a farmer in GLAHOUNSA village in the Ou\u00e9m\u00e9 valley and is a member of the HOUEDOME group GH MISSIMAHOU DE GLAHOUNSA. The inhabitants of this village work the land after the fall of the level of the Ou\u00e9m\u00e9 river. Their land is rich and offers a high yield. Their main activity is growing corn, peppers, vegetables, okra, tomatoes and manioc. The problem for these riverside residents is that, during the flood period, they no longer have anything to do and spend all the income generated from the sale of their harvested produce. When the river level drops they do not have any money left to pay for the workforce essential for sowing the available land. The local practice of selling cheaply the harvest does not provide them with financial security and further bankrupts them. This practice involves selling the future harvest at a rock-bottom price to an affluent person in order to have the required money to continue farming. Tired of this practice, they are requesting a loan of 140 000 FCFA (USD 275) to farm about 1.5  hectares of the aforementioned land. <p> \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by V\u00e9ronique Fourment, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":237250,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Farming of 1.5 hectares of corn and peppers  ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BJ","country":"Benin","town":"Porto-Novo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"6.483333 2.616667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":104,"posted_date":"2008-12-10T20:00:18Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":275,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Christophe","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-12-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":140000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":17500},{"due_date":"2009-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":17500},{"due_date":"2009-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":17500},{"due_date":"2009-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":17500},{"due_date":"2009-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":17500},{"due_date":"2009-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":17500},{"due_date":"2009-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":17500},{"due_date":"2009-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":17500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":34.38},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":34.38},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":34.38},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.38},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.38},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.38},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.38},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.34}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":34.38,"local_amount":17500,"processed_date":"2009-01-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T09:37:35Z","rounded_local_amount":17737.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14821545},{"amount":34.38,"local_amount":17500,"processed_date":"2009-02-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-15T08:37:25Z","rounded_local_amount":17737.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20357811},{"amount":34.38,"local_amount":17500,"processed_date":"2009-03-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T09:31:46Z","rounded_local_amount":17737.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27046861},{"amount":34.37,"local_amount":17500,"processed_date":"2009-04-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T10:18:11Z","rounded_local_amount":17737.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35938479},{"amount":83.09,"local_amount":42300,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T20:48:10Z","rounded_local_amount":42875.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44396145},{"amount":20.04,"local_amount":10200,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T17:07:59Z","rounded_local_amount":10338.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52904022},{"amount":34.36,"local_amount":17500,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T10:26:22Z","rounded_local_amount":17737.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63126030}],"funded_date":"2008-12-11T00:27:44Z","paid_date":"2009-08-15T10:26:22Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Veronique Fourment","image":442735}},{"id":82903,"name":"Marisiano","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Marisiano K. is 32 years old and lives in Gari Village in the Rongo District of Kenya.

He is 33 years old, married, and went to school until the 7th grade.  He had to stop due to the war.  He is the father of 5 children with ages between 5 and 15 years old.  The 4 oldest are in school, and the youngest is in day care.\r\n\r\nMateus left Inhambane for Namaacha, a town on the border of Swaziland, in search of work.  After his arrival he began working in neighboring Swaziland as a domestic servant for 2 years.  He had to quit his job because his home was kilometers from work.  After that he was able to arrange a job in the Hotel Libombos as a security guard where he has worked for over 12 years earning a monthly sum of 2,000MT.  Since his job is during the night during the day he resolved to do business selling staple products.\r\n\r\nHis best products are sodas, beer, desserts, rice, and fish.  Today he is the owner of 3 stands of which one is at home, another in the Shoprite, and one on the border.  He has 2 employees, and with his wife's help he has earned a monthly sum of 5,000MT.  He is not able to save any money because his objective is to further expand his business, and to do this it is necessary that he put all of his earnings toward stimulating his business.\r\n\r\nHe came to know Hluvuku through one of his colleagues, and he requested a loan for 8,000MT to progress his business.  This is his first loan with Hluvuku and with Kiva, and the 8,000MT will be used to increase the stock of his products.  He is confident that he will pay off the loan without any problems so he can solicit another loan to begin working on his construction.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Jared Wandry, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":317508,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Purchase and sale of staple products","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MZ","country":"Mozambique","town":"Namaacha","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-25.970278 32.025556","type":"point"}},"partner_id":23,"posted_date":"2009-05-17T01:20:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":300,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mateus ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-05-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MZN","disbursal_amount":8000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":16,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":421.97},{"due_date":"2009-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":441.04},{"due_date":"2009-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":460.98},{"due_date":"2009-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":481.82},{"due_date":"2009-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":503.6},{"due_date":"2009-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":526.36},{"due_date":"2009-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":550.16},{"due_date":"2010-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":575.03},{"due_date":"2010-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":601.02},{"due_date":"2010-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":628.19},{"due_date":"2010-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":656.59},{"due_date":"2010-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":686.27},{"due_date":"2010-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":717.29},{"due_date":"2010-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":749.68}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.82},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.54},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.29},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.07},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.89},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":19.74},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.63},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.56},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.54},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.56},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.62},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.74},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.9},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.1}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":15.82,"local_amount":421.97,"processed_date":"2009-06-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T21:24:44Z","rounded_local_amount":428.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52971104},{"amount":16.54,"local_amount":441.04,"processed_date":"2009-07-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T14:54:55Z","rounded_local_amount":447.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63190931},{"amount":17.29,"local_amount":460.98,"processed_date":"2009-08-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T16:48:42Z","rounded_local_amount":467.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73618812},{"amount":57.74,"local_amount":1539.78,"processed_date":"2009-09-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T19:50:05Z","rounded_local_amount":1561.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87056659},{"amount":58.89,"local_amount":1570.34,"processed_date":"2009-10-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T23:28:23Z","rounded_local_amount":1592.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96971607},{"amount":31.25,"local_amount":833.43,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:07:06Z","rounded_local_amount":845.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103816598},{"amount":32.87,"local_amount":876.47,"processed_date":"2009-12-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T14:23:26Z","rounded_local_amount":889.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110708751},{"amount":34.04,"local_amount":907.71,"processed_date":"2010-02-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:27:23Z","rounded_local_amount":920.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123937648},{"amount":35.56,"local_amount":948.28,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-24T07:49:09Z","rounded_local_amount":961.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123937649}],"funded_date":"2009-05-17T07:05:22Z","paid_date":"2010-03-24T07:49:09Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":111575,"name":"Afi S\u00e9nam","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Cette dame a ouvert une  boutique dans laquelle elle vend du mat\u00e9riel de bureau, elle fait aussi dans sa boutique du traitement de texte, des impressions sur papiers et la vente de mat\u00e9riel informatique.

G., 34 years of age, lives in Ahuachap\u00e1n with his family that is composed of his wife, a homemaker, and three children ages 3, 8, and 11.  The two oldest children are in school.  Mario sells lumber from his home, where he distributes his product to customers at wholesale.  He has had most of his customers for many years that, because of Mario\u2019s excellent service, continue to purchase wood from him.\r\n\r\nHe is requesting a loan to buy larger quantities of lumber to obtain the product at lower prices, and therefore augment his profits.  Mario\u2019s greatest desire is to increase his sales.  This is because his business is the single source of income to support the family, as he is the sole provider in the household.  \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Mary Lynn Malaby, Kiva

They live together in the town of Machente, located on the edge of the Peruvian rainforest, where they have built their own home out of wood and metal roofing material.  Zenon lives in one of the most accomplished towns in the San Francisco district.  The town of Machente is known as a center for business, because it is the axis between the two cities of San Francisco and Ayacucho.  Zenon mentions that if there are a number of businesses in the same line of work, it is a business that works.  Of course, when he opened his restaurant, he knew what he was doing, but he wasn't afraid of the competition.  It was more that he wanted to try to compete with them and apply a strategy to provide good service and food to the customers' liking.  Given this, he tries to continually improve in terms of the preparation of his dishes and making his restaurant a welcoming place.  In his work, he has the support of his partner and  he also has an assistant who is in charge of the cleaning.  Zenon awaits this loan, so that he can buy tables, chairs, and floral decorations, since he wants to provide good service to his guests.  In the future, he plans to expand his restaurant, and will need a bigger space to accommodate a larger number of customers and therefore have greater earnings.  This will be his 5th loan with MFP, and he has always been very punctual with his payments because he hopes to be able to rely on the same support from all of you.  Thanks to this support, he is trying to improve his living standards.

All the women in this group show an incredible willpower, they are cheerful and extroverted. They all work in the town of Panajachel where they bring happiness to the community whilst they work in their different activities. <p>\r\n\r\nThe women in the group are very happy because they will receive the first loan in their lives. With it, they hope to see their businesses flourish and consequently improve their standard of living.\r\nEven though this is their first loan, all of them have ventured to ask the highest amount that can be given as an initial loan (263USD per person). They are proud of themselves because it is the first time that someone, in this case Friendship Bridge and Kiva, are betting on them and believe in their capabilities. <p>\r\n\r\nMost of them will use the loan to buy and then sell clothing (both new and used) at the market or in the streets. Some will use it to buy ingredients in order to prepare food that they will sell during lunch and diner time. Others will use it to buy and sell jewelry and cosmetics. Finally, one of them is a midwife and she will use the money to buy medicines. <p>\r\nThe midwife is the town's doctor and she takes care of the deliveries, mostly those of indigenous women. Moreover, she also assists with other sicknesses. <p>\r\n\r\nMany of them dream of having their own shops so they don\u2019t have to be street vendors. Others want to pay their first loan in order to show themselves that they are capable of having a good business. <p>\r\nThey all dream of having sound businesses that will allow them to count on a steady income and of course, they all dream about the general wellbeing of their families and community.  <p>\r\n\r\nThe women of the group \u201cBrisas del lago Panajachel\u201d only need an initial support so they can move forward, please help them with this credit and they will not let you down.

Because her husband passed at an early age, she has had to work as a single parent to care for her two young children. Ch\u1ecb M. has participated in the TYM Fund since 2003. \r\n\r\nIn the beginning, she borrowed capital for rearing livestock to produce income for the family but after a while, she realized that the business did not help them bring in much income. Therefore, she diligently borrowed funds to invest in a retail business selling sundries. Currently their income is 2,000,000 VND and is also the main source of income for the family.\r\n\r\nFor this loan cycle, she would like to borrow an additional 9,000,000 VND to purchase more improved personal sundries\/items that are in demand and from there increase the family's income.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Vietnamese by Catherine Tran, Kiva

This is 25-year-old Esta M. from Kyela. She is married with one child. Additionally, she is responsible for supporting two dependents because they are orphans. Esta has been running a crops-selling business since 2006. Client\u2019s business is buying crops from farmers and bringing them to town where she can sell them at a higher price. \r\n<P>\r\nShe works at the business for 9 to 12 hours per day, 7 days per week. Esta currently earns about 100 USD a month from her business. She is requesting a loan of 325 USD in order to purchase more cacao and rice in bulk. In the future, she plans to increase the quantity of cacao and rice that she buys in bulk. Esta thanks you for your support!\r\n<P>\r\nABOUT SELFINA:\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit through micro-leasing in Tanzania. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women and uses the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets; thus they are deemed non-creditworthy by financial institutions.

She is 35 years old, single, and went to school through the 10th grade.  She is the mother of a 14 year old son who is in the 7th grade.\r\n\r\nRute is a native of Namaacha, a town on the border of Swaziland.  She had to interrupt her schooling when she began working in the Hotel Xissaka as the secretary of the Director.  She worked there 5 years but due to a change in supervision she was one of the ones excluded, and she lost her job.  Years later her in-laws kicked her out of the house alleging that her Bantu language was not the same as that of her husband.  She lost her home and was suffering.\r\n\r\nIn the same year she was selected to receive a recompensation from the Hotel Xissaka in the amount of 15,000MT.  She decided to begin her own business of selling bedding that she acquired in South Aftica and resold in the Capital.  She has travels 3 times each month and has many customers and orders for products like sheets, blankets, duvets, vases, curtains, carpets...etc.  She spends 35,000MT with each trip, and after resales she earns 9,000MT.\r\n\r\nShe approached Hluvuku when she lost her home in a fire caused by a short circuit in the wires of Mozambique Electricity, and they would not take responsibility for the accident.  Rute is requesting a loan for 15,000MT from Hluvuku to make repairs on her home.  Besides her son she is also supporting her mother who lives in her house, and she gives her 1,000MT every three months.\r\n\r\nThis is Rute's first loan with Hluvuku and with Kiva.  The 15,000MT will be used to purchase construction materials to make repairs on her home that was consumed by the fire.

Her husband earns an average net income of just 2,700 Philippine pesos (PHP) a month (about $58 US) from labor and because of this they have experienced hardships in raising their children.  \r\n\r\nTo help her husband, Armelinda decided to engage in charcoal buying and selling. For 6 years, she was able to sustain it even in times of crisis. Currently she is earning an average net income of not less than 3,600 PHP (about $78 US) a month, which is very helpful in supporting the family. \r\n\r\nShe joined PAGLAUM MPC just this year because she is very much interested in our products and services and for our being one of the most outstanding cooperatives in Northern Mindanao: we were named Most Outstanding Cooperative in the Philippines during the search for COOP-LGU Partnership Award 2006. \r\n\r\nAs this is her second loan, Armelinda was allowed to request a loan of 8,000 PHP to add her capital for her business. She will use the future income from this business for her family's daily needs and to save for her children's

Due to social reasons he decided to leave Koranic school studies to start earning money from a friend of his. He learnt to buy and sell cowhides. With 8 years' experience, Mr. Broulaye Samak\u00e9 is very good at his job. In order to access a reliable working capital he decided to work with the Soro Yiriwaso loan programme to buy a large amount of cowhides. This is his first time with the microfinance institution Soro Yiriwaso. He buys his stock in Bougouni and in the local area. His customer base is made up of shoemakers and retailers in the subregion. With this loan he hopes to earn a monthly profit of 65,000 FCFA which will meet his needs and grow his business.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Lara Francis, Kiva

He is married to his beloved wife, 24-year old Esmeralda, and they have a 5-month old son called Wilder. \r\n\r\nAlfonso believes that his job growing coffee, bananas, and pineapples is well-rewarded and that any sacrifice he makes is worthwhile. For these reasons he has worked as a farmer for 15 years. Something else that makes the job less hard is the fact that his wife works alongside him. However, at harvest time and when the fields need weeding, he hires workers to help and pays them 20 soles per day.\r\n\r\nAlfonso most enjoys keeping his fields healthy and setting traps for rodents and insects so they don\u2019t harm his crops. This generous family man who loves to have his family by his side wants to increase production of bananas and coffee. As there is a great demand for them in the markets, he gets good money for his produce. In the future he plans to start a home-based business selling groceries so that his wife can look after it and stop working in the fields. This way she will be better able to take care of their son.\r\n\r\nThis is Alfonso\u2019s third loan with Kiva partner MFP and he says he is very happy to continue working with his community group as they are responsible and enterprising people like him. He also says that every decision he makes is supported by his wife. With the loan he will buy several bags of fertilizer to spread on his fields. He will also hire some workers to weed them.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jane Agg, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":900,"image":{"id":568655,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy fertilizer and hire workers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Chanchamayo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.05 -75.316667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":900,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alfonso ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-29T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-27T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-27T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-27T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":2500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":900}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":900,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:33:30Z","rounded_local_amount":2539.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206195460}],"funded_date":"2010-08-02T20:36:23Z","paid_date":"2011-05-15T11:33:30Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jane A"}},{"id":218967,"name":"Franz","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El Sr. Franz Radica en la localidad de el torno distante a 39 km de la ciudad de Santa Cruz, tiene 7 hijos de los cuales tres est\u00e1n con el y los dem\u00e1s ya se casaron y se independizaron, vive en el barrio Miraflores de dicha localidad en casa en alquiler, su ocupaci\u00f3n es herrero, es decir construcci\u00f3n de canaletas para casa, verjas, ventanas, esta actividad es la \u00fanica fuente de ingreso, el destino del cr\u00e9dito es para compra materiales como Hierro, clavos, soldador y as\u00ed poder cubrir sus pedidos, su esposa se dedica a labores del hogar; es cliente nuevo en la instituci\u00f3n y en el sistema financiero y esta muy contento por la oportunidad que le brindan.","en":"Mr. Franz Radica, in El Torno, 39 kilometers from the city of Santa Cruz, has seven childred, three of whom still live with him.

Th\u1ecb (22) is a 51-year-old female living in the town of Thanh Ho\u00e1. Mai is the leader of a three-member group loan offered by Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they all are responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is 06 \u0110\u00f4ng V\u1ec7 (08.05.06 \u0110\u00f4ng V\u1ec7).\r\n\r\nMai is married and has two school-aged children. To make a living, Mai runs a general store. Mai has been engaged in this business for over five years and earns approximately 3,000,000 VND a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Mai joined Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women to gain access to financial services to help improve her business and living situation. Mai has successfully repaid a previous loan of 3,253,800 VND from Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women. This previous loan was used to invest in expanding the business. \r\n\r\nShe is now requesting a new loan of 6,159,600 VND, which will be used to purchase additional inventory and for working capital. This will be the second loan taken out by the borrower from Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women. Mai plans to use the additional revenue generated from the loan to improve and expand her business.\r\n\r\nAbout the other borrowers in the group:\r\n\r\n1. N. Th\u1ecb L. H\u01b0\u01a1ng (19) is a 28-year-old woman who is requesting a 6,159,600 VND loan to support her business in the retail sector running a general store.\r\n\r\n2. Q.

Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in Vietnamese while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\r\n\r\n\r\nMai T.

She is married with two sons and two daughters. Her husband is a municipal employee with a decent salary, but he also works part time in cutting wood for sale in order to increase the family income. Ahlam wants to help her husband in purchasing a new machine for cutting wood to improve his work and increase his sales, but the amount of money she has isn't enough to pay, so she needs to take a loan from FATEN. When Ahlam gets the loan, she will be able to help her husband to purchase this wood-cutting machine, so he will improve his work, produce more wood, and increase his sales, which will increase his income and provide the family with better living conditions. Ahlam is a conservative woman, so her husband Mohammad was photographed instead in the FATEN branch.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout this loan product:\r\n FATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

His wife supports the family by helping out with household tasks, takes care of the kids and vends his products in different stores with her husband. He dedicates as much time in the production of the product. The manufacturing requires much investment at high costs. These investments include organic chemicals for the soil and plantations.

When she realized that this was a good business venture, she began to add items little by little and she now sells wide variety of goods including those you see in the photo.  There is a great demand for these items from tourists who come to her stall looking for handcrafted items.  She now brings in items from other locations, which insures that she is selling unique handicrafts.  This is how Cinthia maintains and increases the number of customers she attracts.\r\n<\/p>\t\r\n<p>With this loan of 800 Nuevo Sol ($275), which she will pay off in six months, Cinthia will purchase  many colors of string and different types of fabric (which she uses to make into beautiful bags).  She will also buy fabric from the indigenous Shipiba tribe which is available in Iquitos.  All of this will enable her to have a good selection of unique items for her customers.  At her young age, Cinthia is already a determined businesswoman who wants to continue expanding her business.  She is 24 years old and has a new born daughter who is her inspiration to continue to improve her situation.  With entrepreneurial vision, she hopes to have her own shop and become more independent.

He is married and has six children: three daughters and three sons. He lives with his wife and some grandchildren in a family apartment in a town called Kofiase, which is a farming\/trading community near Dormaa, the district capital, in the Brong Ahafo region. Stephen says his children are all grown and live independently. His wife is a farmer and food vendor.\r\n\r\nStephen is a commercial driver. He drives a Urvan bus (a small Nissan vehicle).

Today, once again, Homidjon faces this need but he trusts that his loan will be granted to that he can help his business and his family.\n\n\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.
