They live in the city of Cuenca. This is a city, known for the charming historic center and also it has a combination of three cultures rich in symbolism, tradition and art: Ca\u00f1ari, Inca y Spanish.\r\n\r\nMs. Blanca is a member of the communal bank Loma de la Cruz. She lives in the city of Cuenca, in the Miraflores area. She is 64 years old and she has been divorced for 15 years. The reasons were that the husband stood for the divorce thinking that the inheritance would be taken and since he was abroad, they divorced. During the marriage, they had 4 children. Three of her children are married and live independently, away from home. Only her single, 27 year old son lives at home and he helps with her business. He does not have his own house because he is renting.\r\n\r\nBlanca has had a store for 10 years. She works from 6 a.m. to 10 p. m., working from Sunday to Sunday and never closing because she has a faithful clientele. If things go well now that she has a large selection of merchandise, she will have a good bond of friendship with all of her communal bank partners. She is in her second cycle of working with the loans from the foundation and it has been beneficial for stocking her business a little more. She tells us that she was influenced to join the bank by her friend Marlene, who is a member. With the new loan that she receives from the foundation, she is going to invest in the purchase of products for her store like rice, sugar, noodles etc. Since all of the products are expensive and she needs to stock her store. Her biggest dream would be to keep her health, so she can continue working. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Lauren Jackson, Kiva

Luz tiene planeado invertir el cr\u00e9dito en la compra de abono e insecticidas, para asegurar sus tierras en la pr\u00f3xima cosecha. \n\n","en":"Luz is 38 and shares her home with her husband Delfino, who is 40.  They have five children, all but one of whom live independently.  Each day brings hope to Luz, who works cultivating the land to plant potatoes and peas, helped by her husband and son. Though tiring work, Luz enjoys the rewards of tending crops until harvest time, when her family transports the produce to a local wholesale market for sale. She has obtained a stable income from her efforts, and in the future plans to expand cultivation to obtain higher returns. This is her third microloan from MFP, and Luz is very thankful for the opportunities she has had as a result; she is also encouraged by the other members of the communal loan program, who have been responsible in paying off their small loans in a timely way. Specifically, Luz will invest the loan funds in fertilizer and insecticides, to prepare her lands for the next harvest. \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Matthew Cassetta, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":534054,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy fertilizer and insecticides for crops","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-05-06T10:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1050,"lender_count":29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Luz ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-04-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":1050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":3000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1050}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":1050,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T08:52:43Z","rounded_local_amount":3011.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195886391}],"funded_date":"2010-05-06T16:55:28Z","paid_date":"2011-03-24T08:52:43Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Matthew Cassetta","image":260079}},{"id":202221,"name":"Gideon","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Gideon is the 40-year-old father of four children.

From there they built their dream of traveling to Venezuela so that they can live, work, and seek a better future.  They opened a store in the neighboring country, but gradually the situation there became difficult and they decided to find a way to move forward.  Julio and his wife returned to their hometown and started a business selling provisions brought over from Venezuela as well as buying handicrafts from San Juan Nepomuceno to sell in Venezuela.  \r\n<p>\r\nJulio is currently requesting his first Kiva loan which will be used to buy provisions such as rice, powdered milk, and oil as well as shoes, purses, and wallets.  This funding will provide available operating capital to continue receiving low prices for the goods he sells without having to bring them over from Venezuela.  His dream is to have a larger store and convert it into a warehouse where he can sell merchandise in bulk to stores, local distributors, and other entities in the surrounding areas.  \r\n<p>\r\nWith this business, Julio and his wife are able to build a future for their family so that when they are ready to have children, they can provide all the conditions to raise and educate them.  <br

SELFINA has taken a leading role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions as they lack tangible collateral assets. This leads to poor financial support, hence poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. SELFINA buys and leases equipment to women. Where a client needs working capital SELFINA buys equipment from said client, extending a loan to her, then leasing back the same equipment\u2014a process called a sale and leaseback

He usually grows corn and cotton on a small plot of 0.25 hectares.  In addition, he and his wife work together as hired farm laborers.  \r\n<p>\r\nSince his family does not earn a steady source of income, he decided to establish a small grocery in his home.  He has been in business for a year and offers basic necessities, groceries, candy, and a few beverages in order to provide additional support to his family.  Manuel decided to expand his business by buying more beverages to offer to his customers.  He is requesting his first loan from Edpyme Alternativa in the amount of 1000 soles.\r\n<p>\r\nHis greatest wish is to gradually stop farming in order to expand his business activities by raising and selling animals.

quite responsible and very hardworking.\r\n\r\nIn talking with Maria, she provides us with an example to follow: that one can do anything if one has the will.  She runs a home and is devoted to the care of her children, but also has a family business with her husband.  They have had a business selling CDs on one of the main streets of the capital of Manabi province for more than 6 years.  Her husband started this business, thanks to a friend who motivated him and gave him the space to sell CDs of music and films.   She does not earn much, but with this business she has managed to get ahead.  With the help of the Foundation and all of the loans she has received, she has been able to maintain her business.  At first she had to make a big investment to buy a television, DVD player and amplifier to start the business.  Although each CD only costs a dollar, at the end of the week she has earnings of 40 dollars, and on special dates such as mother's day, she sells more.  \r\n\r\nWith this new loan, Maria will invest in the purchase of more CDs, so she will have a greater variety of films and music CDs.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Lisa Grobar, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":534088,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Movie Tapes & DVDs","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy music CDs and DVDs of films   ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Portoviejo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2010-05-06T18:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Auxiliadora","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-04-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":550,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2010-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2010-06-29T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2010-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2010-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2010-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2010-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":68.75,"local_amount":68.75,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:16:55Z","rounded_local_amount":68.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144709136},{"amount":206.25,"local_amount":206.25,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:47:03Z","rounded_local_amount":206.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151892435},{"amount":137.5,"local_amount":137.5,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:10:46Z","rounded_local_amount":137.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159632795},{"amount":137.5,"local_amount":137.5,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:15:08Z","rounded_local_amount":137.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166846829}],"funded_date":"2010-05-07T15:13:23Z","paid_date":"2010-09-15T10:15:08Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lisa Grobar","image":264298}},{"id":202237,"name":"Maria Del Carmen","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora  Mar\u00eda del Carmen es viuda , pero esto no le ha impedido ser una mujer luchadora y forjadora, Y  quiere brindar un gran futuro a sus hijos, sabe que poco a poco se consiguen las cosas,   ella se dedica  a su casa y a sus 6 hijos, y adicionalmente  a  vender  frutas,  este negocio lo tiene ubicado en su casa de alquiler, ah\u00ed  vende frutos de la costa  como guineo, naranjas, mandarinas, mangos,  el dinero que solicita es para invertir en su negocio, sus compras Las realiza en la ciudad de Portoviejo en el mercado numero 2, Mar\u00eda del Carmen  invierte de 200 a 300 d\u00f3lares, aparte de la inversi\u00f3n por cada compra  tiene que pagar el carro que le transporta sus frutos, cada semana o quince d\u00edas compra frutas frescas y  tiene mucha demanda por parte de sus clientes, lo que m\u00e1s vende es el mango , mandarina, naranjas, su negocio lo atiende desde las 7 de la ma\u00f1ana hasta las 8 de la noche.\n\nDesde que quedo viuda, ella tiene un solo objetivo, que ahora se podr\u00eda deducir en su sue\u00f1o, pero que con los a\u00f1os seguramente se realizara, su sue\u00f1o  es poder tener su casa propia, para que sus hijos tengan un futuro,  que estudien para que alg\u00fan d\u00eda le puedan ayudar, son lo \u00fanico que tiene.

She runs a small business in the central city market selling kid\u2019s clothing. Her vending spot is well known for her wide variety of inventory.

Dilbar\u2019s hard work, plain and simple, is the engine that drives her success. She is very consistent in her business planning. Now she is requesting a loan of 9,500 Somoni to increase her assorted merchandise in a recently opened vending location and to expand her trade. One of Dilbar\u2019s long-term plans is to launch her own start-up manufacturing and selling clothing and increase her stock turnover as a result. \r\n  \r\n \r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

A. lives in the city of Yavan. She is 49 years old, married and has 7 children. Kumri has a high school diploma. She takes care of the house and her business is cattle rearing. Kumri has a cow; the milk from this cow is used for the family and also for sale. She sells milk at a market to whole sale buyers. Kumri plans to purchase one more cow in order to increase the volume of milk, thereby increasing her profits. If there is additional milk, Kumri would be able to sell more and receive greater income.

The couple have in their care four children, who are all in school.  Ms. Justine L. has been residing with her husband in the Ay\u00e9lawadj\u00e8 district for almost six months.  She has been selling staple foods for over five years, making sales through a distribution system but also out of the front of her house.  Currently, she has built a shop that will serve as a storehouse and place of business.  She started the aforementioned business around 2003 with start-up funds of 80,000 francs CFA.  Confronted with the problem of inventory and supplies a few months afterwards, she turned to outside financing.  This is why she obtained her first loan on October 25, 2004 in the amount of 50,000 francs, which enabled her to start buying in bulk.  She has come to request as her fifth loan 250,000 francs for acquiring supplies.  \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva

and sells in commercial city markets. This work is very agreeable to him, because raising animals is what he has enjoyed since he was a young boy. Nevertheless he also has other jobs, and one of those is farming potatoes and corn in their respective seasons, taking in to account the bad weather that could damage his products. He requires a certain amount of money to increase the number of his sheep. His goal is to increase his product and thereby increase his household income, and to be solvent in order to continue buying and selling animals. <p>\r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International<p>\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and its famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.<p>\r\n \r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <p>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<p>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She lives with her husband and her 3 younger children in their own house.  She makes a living as a nanny, and works near her home from morning until 2 in the afternoon.  At 3 p.m. Dominga opens up a clothing stand at the entrance to her home, where she has sold clothing for many years.  She really likes this business because it generates good profits; she gives most of the credit to the items she sells and to her neighbors.  On weekends she dedicates all of her time to selling clothing, since those are very busy days for her business.  Dominga\u2019s greatest wish is to have a large quantity of garments, especially the ones that are sought after by young girls in the neighborhood, as those are what sell the most quickly.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Eladio and his wife Virginia have brought up 15 children, of which the youngest Jahir will turn 5 in January and oldest, Adalia, is 34. Add to that some 13 grandchildren and spouses of the 10 live-in kids and you can picture this famous family from San Pedro Columbia. \n\nMost westerners have a hard time even imagining anything past a couple of children, but Eladio and Virginia have embraced each without fail and have worked out parenting to an art. Visitors from around the world have been visiting this beautiful family and their farm since they started a sustainable tourism enterprise. \u201cIt\u2019s lucky to meet my brothers and sisters around the world just through a little garden,\u201d Eladio says enthusiastically. Most of the family is trilingual, as Eladio comes from a Mopan Maya speaking environment and Virginia's background is Q'eqchi', and everybody also speaks English on top of the two Maya tongues. \n\nBeside cacao, they grow more exotic crops like mango, coconut, ginger, lemongrass and Jamaican lime. \u201cI grow whatever the birds or the agouti [type of rodent]bring. That\u2019s how an agouti works. I keep stashing the seeds also,\u201d Eladio assures us with a huge smile. The 31-acre farm has been key in sustaining the numerous family and also served as a source of learning for the family and now visitors from abroad. Eladio and Virginia\u2019s farm is a prime example of integrated farming, where timber and fruit trees abound in harmony and soil is enriched by composting underbrush cleared for pathways to access the crop. Integrated farming brings opportunities for soil enrichment, but also means more work cleaning, pruning and raking the underbrush to transform it to compost. Regular cleaning is indispensable for cacao farms on tropical lowlands as good soil, rain and shade make for prime conditions for growth. \u201cEverybody wants to be a student these days. I want my kids to be farmers,\u201d says Eladio.

At 54 years of age, she was able to invest in the education of her daughters, who had the opportunity to travel abroad after completing their studies, leaving just her and her husband at home. Her abilities with hairstyles and haircuts motivated her to keep practicing and training in fashion as she has been for 20 years. In the beginning, she practiced with her daughters, who supported her just as much in attending to her customers. They mostly visited shopping centers where they combed and styled promoters, which she found very profitable because it was a secure source of income. But over time, her daughters had the opportunity to work abroad, and Gladys was left alone. Backed by her husband, however, she installed a beauty salon in her home, where she worked every day because this activity filled her with joy and the company of her customers filled the void left by her daughters. Gladys hopes to have a branch in the market, where she can increase her clientele and make her beauty salon known. This is her seventh loan with MFP. Her tenure and effort helped her mature in her business and get ahead educating her daughters. The inputs for working in a beauty salon are costly, and she requires various products. She will invest 1000 soles in order to keep working to beautify her customers. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Trisha Bury, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":287313,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty Salon","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"Purchase products and goods for beauty salon","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-03-18T17:20:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gladys","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-02-27T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":63.61},{"due_date":"2009-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":66.57},{"due_date":"2009-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":71},{"due_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":72.98},{"due_date":"2009-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":77.47},{"due_date":"2009-08-29T07:00:00Z","amount":80.96},{"due_date":"2009-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":84.6},{"due_date":"2009-10-29T07:00:00Z","amount":87.67},{"due_date":"2009-11-27T08:00:00Z","amount":92.96},{"due_date":"2009-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":97},{"due_date":"2010-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":99.97},{"due_date":"2010-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":105.21}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":20.67},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.64},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.08},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.72},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.18},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.31},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.49},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.49},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.21},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.52},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.49},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.2}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":20.67,"local_amount":63.61,"processed_date":"2009-03-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:42:59Z","rounded_local_amount":66.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27117238},{"amount":21.63,"local_amount":66.57,"processed_date":"2009-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:53:46Z","rounded_local_amount":69.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36012156},{"amount":23.08,"local_amount":71,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T01:00:47Z","rounded_local_amount":73.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44595741},{"amount":23.72,"local_amount":72.98,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:45:19Z","rounded_local_amount":75.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52990004},{"amount":25.19,"local_amount":77.47,"processed_date":"2009-07-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:46:17Z","rounded_local_amount":80.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63211137},{"amount":210.71,"local_amount":648.37,"processed_date":"2009-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:28:51Z","rounded_local_amount":673.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73640644}],"funded_date":"2009-03-18T18:36:15Z","paid_date":"2009-09-15T19:28:51Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Trisha Bury","image":804995}},{"id":98991,"name":"Mary","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mary A. is 35 years old, married, and the mother of three children who are currently in school.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Actually, she will continue with this business but will make it larger by offering other products. She is doing this after taking in account the current demands for her merchandise.\r\nWith this loan of 1,500.00 soles, she will buy a larger variety of products for her business such as notebooks, photo holders and gift articles such as accessories like watches, rings and necklaces. She will also offer personal hygiene products.\r\nArleni is an optimistic worker, thankful for the opportunity to count on loans that help with women and small business development.\r\n<br

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The serious look Melia has in the photo is a reflection of her vitality and strength.  In spite of the various difficulties her life has given her, she has achieved her goals.  She completed her teaching studies and is now a teacher in a Peruvian state school where she instructs young children in reading and writing.  Because she is very good at her job and self-sacrificing, she was appointed as the supervisor of the State Literacy Program, which teaches elderly people who never had a chance to go to school to read and write.  But the activity she was taught as a young girl was agriculture.  For 20 years, she has been making a living planting coffee, banana trees and cassava.  After each harvest, she sells her produce in the community cooperative and in the various markets in her city.  This is her second loan with MFP, and she is grateful to her communal bank for giving her the opportunity to move her business forward.  She is thinking of investing the loan in the purchase of a motorcycle that fluctuates in price around 4 thousand soles, approximately.  With the purchase of the motorcycle, she will be able to get to and from her farmland more easily.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":649345,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Vehicle","sector":"Personal Use","themes":null,"use":"To purchase a motorcycle so she can get to and from her farmland.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Chanchamayo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.05 -75.316667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-11-24T03:50:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":725,"lender_count":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Melia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-11-11T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":725}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":725,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:48:32Z","rounded_local_amount":2033.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232850434}],"funded_date":"2010-11-25T04:27:08Z","paid_date":"2011-10-15T09:48:32Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Marni Siegal","image":829283}},{"id":255539,"name":"Bebiana","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Bebiana L. is from the town of Trinidad.

Rasul is 48 years old, married and has two children. He is the sole breadwinner for his family, and his only income comes from raising and selling large livestock at the local market. Every year, he buys young heifers from farms in adjacent villages. He raises them with the help of his wife and then sells the adult cows and bulls to local butchers. \r\n<p>\r\nToday Rasul is thinking about expanding his business, since the income from his present herd isn't enough to provide for his family. To do this, he needs $2500 USD to purchase additional young cattle. Rasul has applied for a loan from Kiva's partner organization, IMON International. \r\n<p>\r\nAbout Tajikistan: \r\n<p>\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich place in history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the farthest reach of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged its already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous, and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve their agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\nAbout IMON International:\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients have access to reasonable financial services. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

After the breakup of the Soviet Union, she became involved in animal husbandry, which grew into the primary source of financial support for her family.  Tursun started her business with an initial sum of 20,000 som (KGS) and was able to grow her business to currently have twenty heads of rams, nine cows and one horse, and yielding a monthly profit of 20,000 som (KGS).

This leads to poor financial support, hence poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. SELFINA buys and leases equipment to women.

GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach.

Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement.

I am married to a man whose name is P. and he is a driver by profession, driving an auto-rickshaw (a local three-wheeled motor vehicle). He has been driving this for the past 16 years. <p>\r\n\r\nI am a mother of three kids: two sons and one daughter. All of my kids are getting education from a local school. I stay at home and sew clothes of my neighbors. I sew clothes to help my husband to meet the financial expenses of the household. I have successfully repaid my two previous loans from Asasah (a microfinance institute of Pakistan). Now I am applying again for a loan to change the body of my husband's auto-rickshaw so that he is able to continue his work. <p>\r\n\r\nI\u2019m a group leader of some more women of my locality.

Shamshad baji wants a loan to buy goats for her animal selling business. Shamim baji wants a loan to buy seasonal fruits to resell. <p>\r\n\r\nThis is a group loan. The loan funds will be distributed among the group members, each of whom will invest in her own business. The members mutually guarantee one another's loans.

Now, together with her family of a husband and their three children, she has been able to be at peace and happy in the home that she and her husband recently finished building.  Working in sales was something she dreamed about as a young girl, and she was always drawn to sales.  Since marrying, she has worked in many arenas, like selling clothing on the street, where she had many difficulties because of the danger and delinquency that exists in the markets where she lived.  Nine years ago she had the opportunity to invest in starting a small store, and since then has been dedicated to maintaining her business, always trying to have the necessary products and to give her clients good customer service.  In spite of having this business in the home, she does not neglect to sell clothing, and her customers make requests which Do\u00f1a Vacilia works to fulfill.  She is very happy to continue to grow economically as this will allow her to expand her business and change her store to one with a greater variety of products.  Vacilia is new at MFP, and is very excited for the opportunity to achieve her goals by means of this loan, and, in time, to be a trusted client.  The 3000 soles she requests will be used to buy the necessary merchandise for her store, with the purpose of satisfying the needs of her neighbors and customers.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Emily Meinecke, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":975,"image":{"id":306850,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To increase merchandise","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-04-21T21:00:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":975,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Vacilia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-04-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":975,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":253.65},{"due_date":"2009-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":262.82},{"due_date":"2009-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":275.27},{"due_date":"2009-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":282.29},{"due_date":"2009-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":292.51},{"due_date":"2009-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":305.03},{"due_date":"2009-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":315.71},{"due_date":"2009-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":326.75},{"due_date":"2010-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":337.38},{"due_date":"2010-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":348.59}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.44},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.42},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.46},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.74},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.07},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":99.13},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":102.61},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":106.19},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":109.65},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":113.29}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":82.44,"local_amount":253.65,"processed_date":"2009-05-08T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T00:54:56Z","rounded_local_amount":254.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44596093},{"amount":85.42,"local_amount":262.82,"processed_date":"2009-06-08T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:38:59Z","rounded_local_amount":263.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52990357},{"amount":89.46,"local_amount":275.27,"processed_date":"2009-07-08T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:40:30Z","rounded_local_amount":275.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63211481},{"amount":91.74,"local_amount":282.29,"processed_date":"2009-08-08T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:19:38Z","rounded_local_amount":283,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73640986},{"amount":95.07,"local_amount":292.51,"processed_date":"2009-09-08T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:32:21Z","rounded_local_amount":293.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87080452},{"amount":99.13,"local_amount":305.03,"processed_date":"2009-10-08T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:03:27Z","rounded_local_amount":305.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96996611},{"amount":102.61,"local_amount":315.71,"processed_date":"2009-11-07T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:53:46Z","rounded_local_amount":316.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103842127},{"amount":329.13,"local_amount":1012.72,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-24T09:51:51Z","rounded_local_amount":1015.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110733790}],"funded_date":"2009-04-21T23:21:34Z","paid_date":"2010-01-24T09:51:51Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Emily Meinecke","image":557397}},{"id":107199,"name":"Lerio","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"A hardworking and determined person, Mr. Lerio B. is 54 years old, married and lives in Ibabao, Aloran, Misamis Occidental.

She has been in the \"Av. del Ejercito\" (\"Army Avenue\") communal bank for two loan cycles. \r\n\r\nMariuxi and her husband have a business selling flowers in the central market area of the city of Portoviejo. They started the business one year ago; it has gone very well for them, and Mariuxi is very happy. With the loans she has received from the Foundation, she has expanded her shop, and now it is well-stocked. Each week, she invests $200 in flowers, which are delivered to her directly from the mountainous part of the country. She works in her shop from Monday through Sunday, and she also maintains another flower stand outside her town's main cemetery. On that day, her husband is the one who travels there, working from 7 in the morning until he closes the stand in the evening. \r\n\r\nMariuxi tells us that she sells more flowers on special dates such as Valentine's Day and Mother's Day. She will invest all of the funds in stocking her flower shop. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Patricia Linderman, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":542247,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Buying flowers (roses, carnations, daisies, chrysanthemums, etc.)","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Portoviejo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:24Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":675,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":" Mariuxi Agustina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-04-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":660,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":82.5},{"due_date":"2010-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":82.5},{"due_date":"2010-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":82.5},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.5},{"due_date":"2010-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":82.5},{"due_date":"2010-07-29T07:00:00Z","amount":82.5},{"due_date":"2010-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":82.5},{"due_date":"2010-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":82.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.38},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.37},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.38},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.37},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.38},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.37},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.38},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.37}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":253.13,"local_amount":247.5,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:46:55Z","rounded_local_amount":253.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151892513},{"amount":253.12,"local_amount":247.5,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:10:47Z","rounded_local_amount":253.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159632859},{"amount":168.75,"local_amount":165,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:15:08Z","rounded_local_amount":168.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166846893}],"funded_date":"2010-06-02T16:47:00Z","paid_date":"2010-09-15T10:15:08Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Patricia Linderman","image":100107}},{"id":206381,"name":"Pablita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Pablita G. is from the village of Bucana,Sicayab.

They are in primary and pre-school.  \r\n\r\nShe has worked in her mini grocery store for four years. She remarks that it has gone well for her. She has been able to support herself and her family and keep her srore stocked. She also has the support of her husband, who works in the fields and in other odd jobs to support the household.       \r\n\r\nWhat motivated her to do this activity was that in her community there were no longer any stores where people could buy their necessities and they had to go down to the town to buy them. That is why she was motivated and today, thank God, it has gone well for her with the little she has been able to get from her mini grocery store.   \r\n\r\nWith the earnings that she obtains from her small business, she saves to buy more merchandise that she needs and that the customers require. She also feels satisfied with the service she gives them everyday.    \r\n\r\nHer dream is to expand her business, buying more and better quality merchandise, as well as to save and build a locale where her business can be more diversified and people can be more interested in buying her products.  \r\n     \r\nShe joined the group via an invitation from Efrocinia, who is the group's representative.

He sells his foods (fried rice, rice with peanut sauce, tomato, and green leaves) from his restaurant in the market. It is located along the international route linking Bamako to Abidjan. He completes his sales in cash and on credit, payable on a monthly basis by the officials of the region. \r\n\r\nSibiri C. expects, with the help of this loan, to earn a monthly income of 70.000 FCFA which will be used to repay this loan, to provide for his family's expenses, and to reinvest the remaining portion in his business."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":699581,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Restaurant","sector":"Food","themes":["Rural

She is the group's president.\r\n\r\nNorma is 53 years old, a single mother, and has two children, one of whom is in her care and currently studying thanks to her hard work.  Norma recently acquired a small kiosk which she has located outside her home and there she sells meals and fried food such as kebabs, hot dogs and grilled chicken.  She works hard because she has customers who carry out maintenance work on the roads.  Norma would like to invest her loan money in obtaining school supplies for the 2011 school year since she knows that this way she will make extra profits.  She will also continue selling meals.\r\n\r\nNorma's dream is to one day have a grocery store in her home.  The members of the \"Se\u00f1or de la Esperanza\" community bank are active participants and they are punctual in making their repayments.

Her primary business is selling clothing from her home in Lima, and a year ago she started selling cosmetics as well to earn more money.  \r\n<P>\r\nRosa is very interested in fashion and enjoys selling the clothes and the cosmetics.  She purchases the clothes in bulk from a wholesaler in Lima, and sells them from her home to friends and relatives who have come to count on her for their clothing needs.  She can buy a pair of jeans for 30 Soles ($10) and sell them for 50 Soles ($17).  As a single mother, she needed to increase her income, and a friend recommended she begin selling cosmetics for the company Esika, similar to Mary Kay or Avon. It was easy for her to jump right into this, because several of the regular customers from her clothing business were also interested in purchasing cosmetics from her.  <P>\r\n\r\nRosa lives in a house with 12 other people.  She comes from a family of eight children, and lives with all of her siblings and their children.  Unfortunately, one of her siblings recently passed away, and that has left a deep sadness in their home.  She would love to be able to someday purchase her own house where she and her son can live.  Her son is in school, and even at the young age of six has a dream of becoming an engineer!<P>\r\n\r\nRosa\u2019s dream for her business is to open a store where she can display and sell all her clothing, but it is very expensive to do this: the initial investment would be around 5000 Soles (about $1700).

These products are bought once a week at the market fair of Diamarabougou.

The women work forty-eight hours a week on average.\r\n\r\nLigia started her business with an initial investment of 75,000 colons fourteen years ago.

Her long term goal is to own a clothing store or boutique in order to sell clothes she has designed herself.\r\n\r\nWith this loan, Ligia will buy the raw materials necessary for her sewing business such as spools of thread, cloth, and sewing machines. The loan will also be used to hire more women to help her increase the output of her business. In this way she is not only providing work for herself and members of her family, but also for members of the

This Kiva borrower is receiving a new ELA loan. The ELA program first provides disadvantaged adolescents, usually girls who are out of school, with livelihood training and financial literacy skills. Afterwards, ELA participants can receive microfinance loans to expand their small businesses. These loans offer adolescents a unique chance to access financing at a young age and to improve their prospects for the future. The loans target a segment of the population not typically served by traditional microfinance. Kiva is privileged to partner with BRAC Uganda in posting these new loans, to give Kiva lenders the opportunity to fund deserving young entrepreneurs, and to support a promising new sector in
