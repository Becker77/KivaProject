With the help of these loans, they are able to solve problems that their salaries alone cannot solve.

She lives with El\u00edas, who is a cook.  They live together next to her sister and her two-year-old son, in her own home.  \r\n\r\nThe business Luz has is selling general groceries, so she opened a grocery store in her own house.  She learned the business from her father, who had his grocery store in his house, and with financial help from MFP.  She began her business buying small quantities of products, in this way managing to grow during these four years she has been operating, which up to the present she does alone.\r\n\r\nShe likes her business because it allows her to be at home to be able to take care of her young child, as well as the economic income that serves her to buy what she needs for her home.  Nevertheless, she does not like that some of her customers ask her for credit and then get behind when it comes time to pay.  Even so she continues with her job.  But her goal is to grow as a merchant and expand her grocery store until she converts it into a store where she can sell all types of products.\r\n\r\nThis will be her fourth loan with the MFP institution, and she hopes for your collaboration so she can realize her plans.  She also comments that she feels good about her communal bank because she knows the majority of the members, although there are still some new ones joining.

For Sunadi raising pigs does not require a lot of energy. Important is capital and persistant for her to expand the business. Her last sales was Rp1,950,000 (about US$220) from sales of 2 pigs, that she raised for 5 months with a capital of Rp750,000 (about $82.50) for feed expense, and Rp400,000 (about $44) for feedstock. Sunadi's profit was Rp800,000 (about $88). Sunadi plans to expand her business by obtaining a loan from Dinari for Rp1,500,000 (about $165), which will be used to buy 4 piglets, since 2 parts of her stall are now empty, because the pigs were sold to pay for Final exams expenses of her child I Putu Pande Kartika Yasa, who finished Mechanical Middle School.

Her work will include distributing Nutriflour (a vitamin-enriched flour produced by K-MET) to malnourished patients, providing reproductive health education, referring patients to local clinics and hospitals, and providing basic health care. <p>\r\n\r\nMerit was diagnosed with HIV several years ago. For a time she was sick at home, but when she began to feel better she talked with her friends about how to live with HIV. Her friends recommended that she start a business so that she could keep busy and be active. In 2005 Merit began a business selling chips (french fries) in the Nyalenda neighborhood of Kisumu.<p>\r\n\r\nMerit chose chips because her parents used to have a similar business and she grew up knowing how to cook and sell chips profitably. Merit purchases about 10 kilograms of potatoes from the Kibuye Market in Kisumu weekly. On a busy day she can sell about half her stock.<p>\r\n\r\nBecause she has this business, Merit is able to provide for herself and to eat what she wants. She says she doesn\u2019t need to rely on anyone else. <p>\r\n\r\nMerit has applied for her first loan from K-MET, of approximately $275. She plans to use this money towards purchasing a machine to fry the chips. If she has a machine, the chips will cook faster and then Merit will not lose customers to long waiting times. Merit would also like to purchase a fridge so that she can sell cold soda with the chips.

She is married and has given birth to six children: three sons and three daughters. Fati tells us her two youngest children are currently in school and the rest are married and live independently with their spouses. Fati lives with her husband and their two younger children in a rented apartment in a commercial town called Bekwai, close to Obuasi, a gold-mining town in the Ashanti Region of Ghana. The majority of the inhabitants of Bekwai engage in commercial activities.\r\n<p>\r\nFati trades in fresh yam to earn some income to support her husband and cater for the family.

She owns a business venture, planting & harvesting  a variety of vegetables for sale.  Fiaaveifo has many years of experience in this business.  Fiaaveifo needs a loan of WST $1450 to purchase additional seeds, seedlings & young crops to raise.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 160 tala or US $67 per week) to make improvements to her house.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Fiaaveifo joined SPBD.  This is her 2nd loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Fiaaveifo's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Fiaaveifo L. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.9 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         2 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2.1 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/www.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

With this loan, she will obtain fertilizers for her bean crops since she will harvest them very soon.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":618479,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Comprar fertilizantes para cuidar su cultivo de habas.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-10-17T16:40:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nery ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-09-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":375}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":375,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T09:12:34Z","rounded_local_amount":1048.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221718190}],"funded_date":"2010-10-17T17:36:15Z","paid_date":"2011-08-15T09:12:34Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":242905,"name":"Patrick","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Patrick is 41 years old.

She has 3 children, the two oldest work independently and the youngest is the last child of her companion of 3 years, Jerem\u00edas; they live together in Alto Yapas. The time she spends working with her husband in agriculture are profitable at harvest time; they grow coffee, citrus fruit and plantains on their own land, and have done so for the last 3 years. Her children help her bring in the harvest, and she pays them 20 soles per day.  She enjoys clearing the cropland and weeding, allowing the fruit crops to develop.  She finds it difficult to transport the harvest, package it and get it to markets in cities such as Lima and Huancayo. Delia has now begun selling coffee beans to an export company, and now plans to acquire more land to put into coffee cultivation. She has also established a small general store in her house, and hopes to improve its conditions in the future. Delia is a member of the communal lender \u201cLos progresistas\u201d, and this loan will be her third with MFP, so she is familiar with the group's credit terms.

This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. <p>\r\nThus, SELFINA works for the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility, as a practical way to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":173122,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To expand her range of lipsticks, eyeshadows and perfumes.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Dar es Salaam","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-6.8 39.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-06-23T12:40:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Zena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-07-08T13:09:38Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":400000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2008-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2008-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2008-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2008-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2009-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2009-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2009-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2009-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2009-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":40000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":35,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2008-08-08T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:42:18Z","rounded_local_amount":41685,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":290062},{"amount":35,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2008-09-08T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-09-22T07:13:31Z","rounded_local_amount":41685,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":320419},{"amount":35,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2008-10-08T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-19T07:19:38Z","rounded_local_amount":41685,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":352666},{"amount":35,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2008-11-08T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T03:27:31Z","rounded_local_amount":41685,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5347806},{"amount":35,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2008-12-08T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:08:15Z","rounded_local_amount":41685,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9970378},{"amount":35,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2009-01-08T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:12:53Z","rounded_local_amount":41685,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14886612},{"amount":35,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2009-02-08T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:02:01Z","rounded_local_amount":41685,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20435897},{"amount":35,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2009-03-08T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:54:29Z","rounded_local_amount":41685,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130202},{"amount":34.99,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2009-04-08T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:22:55Z","rounded_local_amount":41685,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027035},{"amount":35.01,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2009-05-08T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:12:37Z","rounded_local_amount":41685,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613075}],"funded_date":"2008-06-24T13:09:38Z","paid_date":"2009-06-16T02:12:37Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":57688,"name":"Aquiles","description":{"languages":["es"],"texts":{"es":"Aquiles is 51 years old, he is a single father of 2 students.

With the money from the loan, she will buy material for the crafts and in the future, she wants to expand her business, to support the culture of her town.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Sofia Burt, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":214676,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"Purchase materials to make local crafts","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Puno","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15.833333 -70.033333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2008-10-24T06:10:14Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":300,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hilda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-11-07T11:26:52Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":900,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":100}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.36}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":33.33,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2008-12-07T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T01:16:56Z","rounded_local_amount":103.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9957437},{"amount":33.33,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2009-01-07T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T14:03:48Z","rounded_local_amount":103.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":10227687},{"amount":33.33,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2009-02-07T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T20:03:26Z","rounded_local_amount":103.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20422922},{"amount":33.33,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2009-03-07T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:33:41Z","rounded_local_amount":103.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27116146},{"amount":33.33,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2009-04-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:43:59Z","rounded_local_amount":103.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36011106},{"amount":33.33,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2009-05-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T00:54:39Z","rounded_local_amount":103.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44594710},{"amount":33.33,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2009-06-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:38:29Z","rounded_local_amount":103.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52989241},{"amount":33.33,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2009-07-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:39:58Z","rounded_local_amount":103.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63210574},{"amount":33.36,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2009-08-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:19:20Z","rounded_local_amount":103.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73640278}],"funded_date":"2008-10-24T10:26:52Z","paid_date":"2009-09-15T19:19:20Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sofia Burt","image":1306467}},{"id":74091,"name":"Flora","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mambo (greetings!) from Tanzania! This is 40-year-old Flora N. from Mwanza, a beautiful city on the shores of Lake Victoria. (Lake Victoria is famous not only because it is one of the largest lakes in the world, but also because it feeds the Nile River, a very important source of life for Africa.) Flora is married and has one child who is 17 years old.  \r\n<p>\r\nSince 2007 Flora has been selling traditional clothing worn by Tanzanian women, called vitenge. Kitenge (the Swahili plural is vitenge) is a cotton fabric with wax print that is printed by using rotary printing machines. Kitenge is a communicating textile--the various colors, patterns, writings, and symbols represent moods, feelings, cultures, and traditions of native African people. Flora works at the business 9 to 12 hours a week, 6 days a week. She is requesting a loan of $400  in order to purchase additional vitenge in bulk for resale. Flora thanks you for your support!\r\n<p>\r\nABOUT SELFINA:<br>\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, so they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that it allows clients to use their equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":224950,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"To purchase additional vitenge in bulk for resale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mwanza","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.516667 32.9","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-11-13T02:00:36Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Flora ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-11-26T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":85},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":85},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":85},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":85},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":85,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2008-12-26T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T09:04:37Z","rounded_local_amount":105400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9970753},{"amount":85,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-01-25T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:15:57Z","rounded_local_amount":105400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14886970},{"amount":85,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-02-24T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:03:56Z","rounded_local_amount":105400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20436230},{"amount":85,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-03-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:56:38Z","rounded_local_amount":105400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130502},{"amount":85,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-04-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:24:49Z","rounded_local_amount":105400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027299}],"funded_date":"2008-11-13T18:33:15Z","paid_date":"2009-05-15T23:24:49Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Susan Olson","image":null}},{"id":78187,"name":"Gulinor","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Gulinor P.  is 60 years old.

She is married and the mother of five kids. She lives in Bekwai zongo community with her husband. Her husband is a security man for a company. Zongo in Ghana is a place which is dominated by Muslims.\r\n\r\nShe is a local manufacturer of palm kernel oil. Palm kernel oil is produced from palm kernels. The palm kernel is a by-product of palm oil. The palm kernel is processed through various stages to obtain the palm kernel oil, which is used to prepare many local dishes like frying fish, local soaps and pastries. She produces and supplies to food vendors to prepare their meals. However, her production is on the low side as a result of low working capital to afford a machine for the processing. She wants to use the loan to buy more bags of palm kernel, and an electric milling machine to reduce the drudgery of using manual labour to help produce larger quantities.

They named their group Frozen Fish Mongers, picking a name that reflects their trade. They are all local entrepreneurs in Makeni in northern Sierra Leone. This is not their first loan from Kiva through SMT. They all previously received several loans from Kiva through SMT. Each member of the group received a loan of Le 1,200,000 during the last loan cycle. That loan created meaningful impacts in the lives of these borrowers. They were able to use the proceeds to pay for their children\u2019s school fees.  They\u2019re also able to feed and clothe themselves and their children with the income generated from the loans.  Today, they are requesting a loan of Le 1,300,000 each to buy more cartons of frozen fish to add to their businesses.\r\n<p>\r\nKadiatu (back row, right) is the leader of the group. She is forty-five years of age. She was born in Makeni, northern Sierra Leone. She is married to a businessman and the couple has four children. Two of her children are in college and two are in secondary schools. Kadiatu has been a businesswoman for over twenty years now.\r\n<p> \r\nKadiatu, like the rest of the group members, sells frozen fish. With this new loan, she will expand her business. She will be able to buy about ten cartons of frozen fish. She usually travels to Freetown to buy the fish. The fare to Freetown is Le 12,000 and she usually pays a delivery fee of Le 1,000 per carton.

She is starting a business venture, sewing different kinds of clothes and dresses .  Matelani needs a loan of WST $1000 to purchase a new sewing machine.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 125 tala or US $52 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Matelani joined SPBD.  This is her 1st loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Matelani's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Matelani R. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                2 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              2.1 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.5 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              1.5 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/www.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

He is 43 years old and is from the city of Anta. He lives with his partner and 3 children. His principal economic activity is providing personal security. He works for the Ministry of the Interior as a trusted personal assistant to a public functionary. He has been doing this for 8 years and has done very well, thanks to the effort he puts into his work. He also has a complementary economic activity - breeding, buying and selling small animals such as guinea pigs. Julio has a small shed at his house where he has 40 female guinea pigs. \r\n\r\nJulio Cesar is a very hard-working and empresarial person who is always looking for ways to move forward. By working hard each day he wants to give his children a better future. He requires a loan to expand his shed and purchase a breed of guinea pigs. Julio tells us with great sadness that the humidity has affected his guinea pigs, and a considerable quantity have died. Notwithstanding the adversities of the climate, he will continue with the business. \r\n\r\nJulio's yearning is to expand his business, buying guinea pigs in quantity to sells them during important festivals, such as the city of Cusco's anniversary. He would also like to open a restaurant selling typical food from the region, such as 'Chiriuchu'.

They help each other out tending to their pineapple crops, which they plant on rented land since he doesn\u2019t have the necessary means to buy his own.\r\n\r\nDespite the difficulties he has faced, he managed to educate and support his family.  In addition, he tells us that 10 years ago he embarked on creating a coffee plant nursery (a cultivation technique used to obtain a grow a good crop), in which he must invest a great deal of funds.  To date, he averages 100 thousand saplings, obtaining a profit of 10 to 30 thousand soles.  Everything depends on the orders he manages to obtain.  Things are going well for him and, while he has the strength, he will continue to work hard to save so he can buy land for his children to inherit.  \r\n\r\nHe belongs to \u201cThe Progressives\u201d cooperative bank, and this is his first loan with MFP.  He hopes to obtain a good result thanks to the collective support of his association.  Jorge has an order for one thousand saplings, which is why he will purchase coffee seeds with the requested loan.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":773695,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"buy coffee plant seeds.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Chanchamayo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.05 -75.316667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-05-22T03:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jorge ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-05-05T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":375}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":375,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:32:14Z","rounded_local_amount":1031.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263385340}],"funded_date":"2011-05-22T23:55:24Z","paid_date":"2012-03-15T10:32:14Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":304388,"name":"Dj\u00e9n\u00e8bou","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Dj\u00e9n\u00e8bou N. est une veuve de 37 ans et m\u00e8re de cinq enfants qui vit avec ses enfants chez son d\u00e9funt \u00e9poux \u00e0 Wayerma I, un des  quartiers populaires de la ville de Sikasso.\nDj\u00e9n\u00e8bou N. m\u00e8ne des activit\u00e9s diverses et vari\u00e9es : achat et vente des draps de lits,  de pagnes wax et  des chargements de bois de chauffe depuis plus de quatre  ans.

50 years old.  He lives in the town of Vanadzor.  Samvel's wife works as a teacher at a secondary school, oldest son attends the Yerevan State Medical University, and the youngest son attends school.  Samvel has been involved in carpentry for over 10 years.  He re-purposed one of the rooms in his house into a workshop, where he makes products from wood.  Samvel accepts orders for making furniture and sells wooden souvenirs in a leased space at the city department store.  He also sells table clocks and paintings from Yerevan there.  Samvel's products stand out due to its high quality, taste and mastery.  He cuts very difficult ornaments on the furniture and backgammon, which is why he always has new orders.  This business allows Samvel to support his family and pay for his oldest son's education.  In order to increase his family's income, Samvel wants to start selling ceramic dishwares, vases, statuettes, etc.  He needs a loan in the sum of 1,000,000 dram for this purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2675,"image":{"id":873182,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Furniture

In their loan application, the group described their business as follows:\r\n<p>\r\n\u201cContext: The project is located in Oussouye in the south of Senegal.  It comprises women who work together to improve their living conditions and those of their families.  Oussouye is known for its tourism, which is why local commerce to provide the hotels with foodstuffs is the principal business activity.\r\n<p>\r\nPurpose:  The objectives of the group include increasing the income of its members, alleviating the burden of the housewife, and improving the living conditions of its members.\r\n<p>\r\nBusiness activities:  In order to carry out its business properly, the group is requesting a loan to allow it to purchase merchandise in the markets of nearby towns such as Ziguinchor, Bignona and Kolda, in order to satisfy the local demand for these goods.\u201d \r\n<p>\r\nBackground\r\n<p>\r\nSenegal is one of the world\u2019s poorest countries, yet its solid democratic tradition and highly developed associational life distinguish it from other countries in its income group. Especially remarkable are Senegal\u2019s networks of rotating savings and credit associations, known as tontines. Commonly organized by groups of twenty to thirty housewives who live in the same village, the tontines provide poor women throughout the country with small loans to finance modest income-generating activities. Repayment rates within these associations are excellent, because they are based on local reputation and personal trust between the members. However, their financial resources are limited to the contributions of their members, frequently subsistence farmers with very little disposable income. This has prevented the traditional tontines from meeting the demand for rural microenterprise loans and restricted their impact on the economic development of their communities. The SEM Fund works to bridge this gap by linking traditional village credit associations with outside sources of finance.\r\n<p>\r\n<b> Business description translated from French by Senegal Ecovillage Microfinance Fund. <\/b>\r\n<p>\r\n\u00abContexte : Le projet se situ \u00e0 Oussouye au sud du S\u00e9n\u00e9gal ;

She and her husband Jomarie agreed to get a loan from ASHI in order to attain her aspiration in life.  In 2007, Jinalyn joined ASHI. That year, she only received PHP5,000 loan. After two years of  maintaining her good performance in ASHI such as a good repayment record and a good attendance in center meetings, she is now qualified to apply for a loan in a higher amount.\r\n\r\nJust recently, Jinalyn applied for a loan from ASHI amounting to PHP14,000. This loan will be used as additional capital for  the business she had been doing since the time she joined ASHI - her buy and sell  fish business. \r\n\r\nThrough the opportunity Jinalyn receives from ASHI, she believes that her loan will not only enhance her business and child's education but also will provide her family a secured house.

He is married and is a father of 6 children.  His wife is not employed.  She stays at home, does domestic work and feeds livestock.  Ubaidullo is involved in feeding and selling livestock.  Summer time for Ubaidullo is the season for purchasing livestock because livestock and animal feed prices are cheaper during the summer.  And he does not need to spend very much on feeding livestock.  Livestock eats mountain grass, allowing Ubaidullo to save on livestock feed.  At the onset of winter, Ubaidullo sells some of the fed livestock, but he does not buy new livestock.  He buys animal feed for the remaining livestock.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Russian by Anna Sorokina-Hailey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":354818,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Livestock feeding and sales","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Utkansoi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":47,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":700,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ubaidullo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-07-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1500},{"due_date":"2010-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":350},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":350}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Anna Sorokina","image":null}},{"id":127355,"name":"Almira","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Almira C., 33, lives with her husband Elvin, 32, a family driver, and their two grade school children in the heart of a joyful community in Maricaban, Pasay City.\r\n\r\nAlmira owns a general store located just in front of her house.

loving and hardworking mother who continuously works for the betterment of her family: this is Fely V.. She is 45 years old and married to Jun V. who is a tricycle driver and who also helps his wife to run their business. They have two children who are 19 and 21 years old and are still studying. The family lives in the village of Barangay Mabini, Cadiz City, Negros Occidental.\r\n\r\nThe couple strives really hard to provide for the future of their children. Jun drives the tricycle (a motorcycle with a passenger sidecar) that they own to shuttle passengers around town for a fee. Fely started a general store using recycled lumber for its structure just so she could have a place to setup her business. She knew even then that, once the business became stable, she would be able to start repairs and improve the structure.\r\n\r\nIn addition to these two businesses, the couple also wakes up before dawn to buy fish either in the market or in the fishing port and sells it in front of their general store. Fely also started selling coffee and snacks as well as coconut wine adjacent to her house.\r\n\r\nIn 2002, Fely joined NWTF-Project Dungganon to access additional capital for their expanding businesses. With more capital, she was able to increase her monthly income to PHP 20,000 on the average, providing their family with a more comfortable living and enabling her to make improvements to her store and house and have some left for savings.\r\n\r\nFely borrowed PHP 29,500 on her previous loan which she used as additional capital in her general store business. She paid all of her weekly installments in full without any delays within her loan term. She now is borrowing the same amount of PHP 29,500 to use as working capital for her business. The income from it will be used to support the family's household needs. \r\n\r\n\r\n<b> About NWTF:<\/b>\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the call of not just a few, but thousands of women. Through the alleviation program, these women have progressed from earning less than a measly $1 a day, to surpassing realities beyond their dreams. They have learned to live a life where they can finally be called honorable. This is Project Dungganon.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":403906,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

However, because of poverty and low income, she somehow understands the reason for her children\u2019s decision.\r\n\r\nInstead of succumbing to frustrations and disappointments, Mary Jane wants to grow her husband\u2019s fishing business so as to increase the volume of fish she directly sells to people in their village and in the neighboring villages. Through this, their income will be increased and she will be able to support the education of her three youngest children until they graduate from college.\r\n\r\nThe loan she is requesting now is the greatest opportunity for her to change the pattern of life of her three remaining children.

For about a year he has worked manufacturing refrigerators and ice chests, among other appliances. He has a large client base because he is known for the well-finished products that he makes.  He likes his job because he is accustomed to hard work and because he earns good income, which is enough to support his three children who are his reason for living.  Currently Pablos works with a group of colleagues who offer the same services but in the future he wishes to open his own shop.  The group is very united but Pablo thinks a lot about his family and providing them with a better future, so he wants to become independent and launch his own, individual business.  This is his second loan with MFP and he promises to be punctual and responsible as he was previously.  With the money from this loan he wants to buy tools and machinery to start his own business. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Mary McKee, Kiva

She owns a business venture, planting & harvesting breadfruit for sale.  Merenaite has many years of experience in this business.  Merenaite needs a loan of WST $1000 to purchase general farm supplies & equipment.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 180 tala or US $75 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Merenaite joined SPBD.    This is her 1st loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Merenaite's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Merenaite F. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.89 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2 out of 3\r\n\r\nYou can view pictures of a typical vegetable garden in Samoa, taken by a Kiva Fellow, at:   http:\/\/picasaweb.google.com\/agnes.p.chu\/VegetableGarden#\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/www.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

This is an average size family in Isfara, Tajikistan. However, Ilhom is also a unique entrepreneur. Together with his wife, he has been selling blankets, towels, shawls and other things at the central city market for about 6 years. The secret of his success is simple: not only does he let his customers know the benefits of his products,  he also gives them a sense of relationship which brings them back again and again. However, he doesn\u2019t want to stop where he is at with his venture. Ilhom is seeking a loan of $1000 USD to re-stock the merchandise in his store. We believe that Ilhom\u2019s desire to excel in pleasing his customers will determine his further success and encourage new customers to buy from him.  \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The official name of this borrowing group is Glory V. Group.\r\n\r\nGlory is married and has three school-aged children. To make a living, Glory owns and operates a business venture in the retail sector running a general store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling a variety of different products in the local community. Glory has been engaged in her business for over 10 years and earns approximately 5000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Glory joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Glory has successfully repaid a previous loan of 13,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase new items to expand product offering. Glory is requesting a new loan of 15000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the 4th loan taken out by Glory from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay the tuition fees of the borrower's children. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 38 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She solicited a loan of 15,000 <i>meticais<\/i> for the purchase of a bunch of chickens for resale, and one part for the purchase of chicks for resale as well,  strengthening the volume of her business. Her product has been most sought after on weekends and at the end of the month, when there is more demand.<p>\r\n<p>\r\nIn the future, she would like to have a store where she can stock her products, as she currently delivers to  homes.  Her loan will go to toward that end.<p>\r\n<p>\r\n<b>Translated by Ilse Ackerman, Kiva volunteer<\/b><p>\r\n<p>\r\nVirg\u00ednia  Jo\u00e3o H., nascido aos 27 de Dezembro de 1971 em Maputo perdeu o pai apenas com 4 anos tendo ficado a viver com a m\u00e3e at\u00e9 aos 10 anos.

This is 35-year-old Magdalena M. from Mwanza. She is married with four children between the ages of eight and 18 years. Magdalena has been running an African clothes business since 2006. She sells traditional clothing worn by Tanzanian women, called kanga and vitenge. The kanga is a piece of printed cotton fabric often with a border along all four sides. It is printed using the silkscreen method with its pattern in frames. Kitenge (the Swahili plural is vitenge) is a cotton fabric with wax print, printed by using rotary printing machines. Kitenge is an expressive textile: the various colors, patterns, writings and symbols represent moods, feelings, cultures, and traditions of native African people. Magdalena works at the business for 12 hours per day, six days per week. Magdalena currently earns about 120 USD from her business. She is requesting a loan of 400 USD in order to purchase more African clothes to resell. Magdalena thanks you for your support!\r\n<P>\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of microcredit in Tanzania. The organization is devoted to the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through microfinance as a practical way to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets; thus, they are deemed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and hence poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":225016,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"To purchase more clothing for resale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mwanza","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.516667 32.9","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-11-18T23:20:22Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Magdalena ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-11-26T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2008-12-26T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T09:04:32Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9970765},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-01-25T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:15:15Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14886982},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-02-24T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:03:52Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20436242},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-03-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:56:37Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130514},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-04-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:24:47Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027311},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-05-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:14:33Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613330},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-06-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:01:55Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010413},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-07-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:38:34Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63232724},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-08-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:52:36Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73664540},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-09-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T02:46:10Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87105271}],"funded_date":"2008-11-19T06:17:42Z","paid_date":"2009-10-16T02:46:10Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jason Groce","image":null}},{"id":78219,"name":"Ruth De Jesus","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Ruth de Jes\u00fas D\u00e1vila, tiene la edad de 24 a\u00f1os,  habita en el borgo\u00f1a ubicado en el municipio de Ticuantepe, junto a su esposo, el cual trabaja como jardinero en una casa privada para poder ayudarle con los gastos de la casa, ya que tiene a su cargo a la mam\u00e1, ellos todav\u00eda no tienen hijos.

She is a married woman with two children. Currently all her kids are in school. She sells frozen foods like chicken, mutton, fish, meat, etc. in the local market where she lives. She travels to Kumasi to purchase her stock of goods from the big cold-storage houses. She makes sure she buys only what she can afford, which mostly is not enough.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

her community. She is 40 years old, married and has four school-aged children. They are from the village of Dugayong, Amulung, Cagayan. Belinda is just starting this business.\n\nIn 2010, Belinda joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living conditions and enable her to engage in business activities. Belinda is requesting a loan of 4,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This will be her first loan from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue to pay the tuition fees of her children. \n\nBelinda is the leader of a five member group accessing a loan offered by ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members, if someone is delinquent or defaults.\n\nAbout ASKI:\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines.

She is 44 years old and joined the Bambilor group fund in September 2009. She has been involved in the business sector for 5 years and is engaged in buying and selling oil. She started her business after having abandoned her studies. What interests her about business is the income it generates, thanks to which she is able to provide for herself. This loan of 300,000 frs that she is seeking will be used to buy 18 cans of oil, each containing 20 litres.

She is 42 years old. Imelda is the group leader of a 7-member group loan offered by ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is Imelda C.'s Group.\r\n\r\nImelda is married and has 2 school-aged children. To make a living, Imelda owns & operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising crops. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from planting & harvesting  a variety of vegetables for sale. Imelda has been engaged in her business for over 20 years and earns approximately 5000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Imelda joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Imelda has successfully repaid a previous loan of 13,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional seeds, seedlings & young crops to raise. Imelda is requesting a new loan of 15000 PHP which will be used to purchase fertilizers such as manure. This loan will be the 4th loan taken out by Imelda from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay the tuition fees of her children. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 38 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She joined through the Acholi Quarter Satelite Center. She moved to Kampala from the Gulu in the North to escape the war but she does not live in the quarters. However, she went there each day to work in the rock quarry. This was very hard on her since she had no money for transport and this forced her to walk 3 kms each way. She earned barely enough money to survive on but she had no choice since the survival of her family depended on what she could earn. Many days they had no food and they lived under the constant threat from the landlord of being thrown out of their home.<\/p> <p>Grace's move to Kampala also has another reason. While still in the North, Grace and her husband had divorced and she was left with her eight children to fend for themselves.<\/p> <p>Life in Africa has given Grace and her family new hope. The association with others and the sharing of knowledge and skills has given Grace the idea and desire to start a business. School fees for eight children is almost impossible and she worries, especially about the older girls. Her plan is to open a maize flour shop near her home. She has a 25 year old daughter who will work the shop. I talked to the daughter is she is very excited. It will not only give her work to do but she is happy that she will be earning money to help her mother and perhaps help pay school fees for her siblings. For this project Grace is seeking a loan in the amount of 800,000.

It makes her feel good to attend to the teachers and students in a cheerful and warm manner. She maintains this cheerfulness in her daily duties so that she can forget the sadness that she's felt since her husband left to work in Jun\u00edn (Peru).<p>\r\n\r\nThis is the reality for many families who don\u2019t have the resources necessary to enable them to live.  They end up having to find work far away from their home and families in order to earn a living.  In spite of living with this pain, she continues to give her best in her snack shop.  She has now also opened a store in her home that sells products made by local artisans.  This helps her generate additional income to sustain her family.  In order to strengthen the older business (the snack shop) she is asking for a loan of $175.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

They have 5 children: Irma (39), Jaime (48), Iris (44), Maribel (42), and Ever (40). They have formed their own families and don't live in at home. Left alone, Maximiliana and her husband now live with one of their neices. They support her while she studies and becomes a good professional. For 40 years Maximiliana has sold food in her restaurant. She started this business thanks to her ability in the kitchen that is always loved. This has allowed her to have a good business to this day. However, it is tolling. She wakes up at 5am to prepare breakfast for her customers until about 9am. Then she starts to make the lunch plates. At 2pm she has a small break. At 5 she makes dinner plates. This happens everyday. Happily, \"Lady Maxi,\" as she is called, has two women to help her in the kitchen and with serving customers (they are in the photo with her.) Howver, they can't cope with giving service to so many customers when the restaurant is busy. The business is profitable and she hopes to expand it soon, but she needs to buy a new freezer to keep everything fresh. Maxi is an old client of MFP, for health reasons she stopped taking out loans with this institution, but she is now returning after awhile. Now that her health is better, this loan will help her have better stability, and she likes this bank a lot because everyone is nice and happy. With the requested money she hopes she will buy a considerable amount of supplies, such as noodles, rice and potatoes, for the preparation of her dishes.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Caitlin Brooks, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":305929,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Restaurant","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Buying ingredients for making food","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-04-25T06:30:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":175,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maximiliana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-03-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":63},{"due_date":"2009-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":63},{"due_date":"2009-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":63},{"due_date":"2009-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":63},{"due_date":"2009-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":63},{"due_date":"2009-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":63},{"due_date":"2009-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":63},{"due_date":"2009-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":59}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.05},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.05},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.05},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.05},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.05},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.05},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.05},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":22.04,"local_amount":63,"processed_date":"2009-04-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:49:26Z","rounded_local_amount":67.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36012488},{"amount":22.05,"local_amount":63,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T01:01:54Z","rounded_local_amount":67.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44596078},{"amount":22.05,"local_amount":63,"processed_date":"2009-06-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:43:32Z","rounded_local_amount":67.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52990342},{"amount":22.06,"local_amount":63,"processed_date":"2009-07-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:44:38Z","rounded_local_amount":67.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63211465},{"amount":22.05,"local_amount":63,"processed_date":"2009-08-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:27:01Z","rounded_local_amount":67.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73640970},{"amount":22.05,"local_amount":63,"processed_date":"2009-09-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:38:39Z","rounded_local_amount":67.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87080436},{"amount":22.05,"local_amount":63,"processed_date":"2009-10-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:14:24Z","rounded_local_amount":67.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96996601},{"amount":20.65,"local_amount":59,"processed_date":"2009-11-21T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:55:46Z","rounded_local_amount":63.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103842120}],"funded_date":"2009-04-25T08:41:09Z","paid_date":"2009-12-15T13:55:46Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Caitlin Brooks","image":263842}},{"id":106907,"name":"Heng","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. K. is 27-years-old and the mother of one young child who is enrolled in the local school.

organo de Ganado para hacer los mas exquisitos platos de la comida colombiana,panza,corazon, higado, ri\u00f1ones y pulmon;   \u00e8l lo aprendi\u00f2 tradicionalmente de su padre de quien dice es el \u201cmondonguero mayor\u201d que significa vendedor de panza que montado en un asno ofrece estos productos. \nAlfredo como su padre tambien practica este oficio, pero ahora lo hace en un bicicoche donde ademas de hacer ejercicios,  gana dinero vendiendo viceras  recorriendo la zona  alrededor del barrio Galan de Barranquilla, sitio donde esta ubicada su vivienda. Trabaja como un experto  cortador  carnico,  tiene 12 a\u00f1os de haber iniciado su negocio y le gusta vender estos produtos porque con ellos se preparan los mas exquisitos platos de la comida colombiana: por ejemplo las sopas  de mondongo que es la sopa de panza cortada en cuadritos a la cual agregan papa, yuca maiz,veduras frescas , clavito de olor, sal al gusto y hasta pezu\u00f1a o medula de Ganado.\nEs usual para alfredo, vestirse con su bata blaca y gorra e ir diariamente al Mercado desde las 4:00 a.m. a comprar viceras en su bicicoche, luego recorre mas de 6 barrios con su cuchillo afilado,  2 neveras de polietireno , un balanza  y una Madera donde se afirma para cortar y vender por libras sus productos, porque Alfredo vende al detal a mas de 150 clientes diarios, algunos son atendidos por su padre que ya no va en asno, sino en un vehiculo similar al de \u00e8ste  y con quien divide la zona de trabajo.  Ellos dos son muy reconocidos  porque los clients saben que venden viceras de calidad , frescas y no los enga\u00f1an en el pesaje.\nEl dice que  conoci\u00f2 a la Fundaci\u00f2n  Mario Santo Domingo, o a la Mario como cari\u00f1osamente la llaman, porque todos en el barrio saben que tienen programas de credito, capacitaci\u00f2n y tambien de vivienda.

Esto hace que su  aceptaci\u00f2n sea r\u00e0pida en la comunidad donde incursiona.\nDescribe al barrio Galan como un lugar donde vive gente tranquila,  los vecinos se cuidan los unos a los otros y sobre todo cuando saben que cargan  dinero producto de las ventas, asi ellos est\u00e0n pendientes de Alfredo y eso le gusta.\nAlfredo V. es un buenagente como dicen sus vecinos, el  siempre est\u00e0 dispuesto a colaborar y a continuar recorriendo alegremente en su bicicoche las calles de Barranquilla para mantener a su familia y mejorar cada dia su nivel de vida.   \n","en":"From a very young age, Alfredo was fully aware of viscera, the internal organs of livestock used in making the most exquisite Colombian dishes.  These include the stomach, heart, liver, kidneys, and lungs.  He learned this tradition from his father, who is known as \u201cEl Mondonguero Mayor\u201d (The Great Tripe Seller) and travels by donkey to sell his products.\r\n<p>\r\nAlfredo followed in his father\u2019s footsteps, except he uses a bicycle cart to sell his goods.  He earns his living traveling through the area near his home in the neighborhoods surrounding Galan de Barranquilla to sell internal organs.  Alfredo is known as an expert meat cutter and has been in this profession for twelve years.  He enjoys working with these products because they are staples in many of the dishes that make up Colombian cuisine.  For example, tripe is used in a lot of soups when combined with potatoes, cassava, corn, fresh vegetables, cloves, and salt to taste.  Some recipes even call for the hoof and bone marrow of the cow.    \r\n<p>\r\nAlfredo\u2019s usual schedule is to travel to the market every day at 4am, dressed in a white apron and cap, to buy internal organs to stock his bicycle cart.  Later he travels to more than six neighborhoods with his sharp knife, two styrofoam ice chests, a scale, and a butcher block so that he can begin cutting and selling his products by the pound.  Alfredo serves more than 150 customers each day, some of whom were previous patrons of his father.  Since Alfredo has his own mode of transportation, he and his father decided to divide the sales territory.  They both are well-recognized by their customers and known for the quality and freshness of their products.  In addition, they have an honest reputation since they don\u2019t cheat when weighing the goods.\r\n<p>\r\nAlfredo learned about Fundaci\u00f2n Mario Santo Domingo (or simply \u201cMario\u201d as he likes to call it) from everyone in the neighborhood because of the credit programs, training seminars, and housing services that it offers.  This is his second loan and he hopes to obtain financing of 1,000,000 COP to acquire more products for his business.  These include the meats that his customers request on a frequent basis as well as internal organs he plans to buy in bulk.  Alfredo lives in his father\u2019s home with his wife and their three daughters (age 15, 6, and 3 respectively).  His dream is to have his own house and see his children grow up to become independent and studious individuals.  For this reason, he and his wife strive daily on a personal level because they care deeply about their daughters\u2019 education.\r\n<p>\r\nAlfredo\u2019s greatest wish is to open a well-stocked vending location and hire employees to travel to different neighborhoods because his customers enjoy having his products delivered to their front door.  This service is especially popular among pensioners who are sitting at their front door waiting to strike up a conversation with Alfredo.  There have been several occasions in which he was delayed in making deliveries because he is a good listener and very patient with his customers.  His services are accepted rapidly in areas where he has not visited before.  \r\n<p>\r\nThe neighborhood of Galan is a place where the residents live peacefully.

Because of her good repayment performance with her previous loans, she was able to borrow quite a few times in CCT\u2019s Cooperative. She is consistent in paying her dues, because she uses the money she borrows to expand and improve her businesses. \r\n\r\nTo help her continue operation of her business, she would like to apply for a Php17,000 loan. This amount will be used as a source of added capital to her expanding business by buying materials and other raw ingredients for her food vending business and purchasing additional stocks for her buy and sell of ready-to-wear items.\r\n\r\nShe dreams that her business will continue to grow and be able to have its own commercial space.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay Micro Finance

She lives in her own house together with her beloved son Kyo, age 3, whom she cares for and educates in the town of Huayounioc. Mariluz's business is selling natural products, which she sells in the city of Lima, where she regularly travels. She is a very persuasive seller, and she is always able to sell all of her products, since if she does not do so she feels that the day's sales were not fruitful, and she will have to work twice as hard the next day. What she likes most about her work is advising her customers about the remedies they need, since many of them are not knowledgeable about the benefits of certain natural plants which grow in our country. She has done this work for 12 years, and she thinks the most difficult part is remaining all day at her sales stand, since she spends hours and hours in the heat and cold of the streets; for this reason, she hopes over time to have a store where she can sell with more comfort and peace of mind. Her main difficulty is the lack of working capital, since she has to invest in buying various plants when they appear occasionally, since they are very hard to find.
