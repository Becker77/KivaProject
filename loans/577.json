The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

This is the first time she has received a loan from Kiva partner MFP (Microfinanzas PRISMA), and she has high expectations because of her work with the communal banking representative.  She will buy a moto-car with this loan, which will cost 4000 soles (about $1,220), and she will use the money from this loan and money she has saved for this purpose to buy it.  She needs this mobility, as it will help her transport her merchandise.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Laura Westin, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":276514,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Soft Drinks","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Buy a moto-car to transport her products","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-02-23T06:00:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Damaris","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-02-13T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":153.29},{"due_date":"2009-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":155.56},{"due_date":"2009-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":163.86},{"due_date":"2009-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":169.49},{"due_date":"2009-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":175.3},{"due_date":"2009-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":182.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":49.82},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.56},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.25},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.08},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.97},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.32}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":49.82,"local_amount":153.29,"processed_date":"2009-03-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:36:18Z","rounded_local_amount":163.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27117167},{"amount":50.55,"local_amount":155.56,"processed_date":"2009-04-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:46:19Z","rounded_local_amount":165.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36012078},{"amount":53.25,"local_amount":163.86,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T01:02:40Z","rounded_local_amount":174.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44595663},{"amount":55.08,"local_amount":169.49,"processed_date":"2009-06-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:39:53Z","rounded_local_amount":180.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52989925},{"amount":56.98,"local_amount":175.3,"processed_date":"2009-07-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:42:20Z","rounded_local_amount":186.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63211057},{"amount":59.32,"local_amount":182.5,"processed_date":"2009-08-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:20:38Z","rounded_local_amount":194.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73640550}],"funded_date":"2009-02-23T07:46:58Z","paid_date":"2009-09-15T19:20:38Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Laura Westin","image":54967}},{"id":95103,"name":"Pamela Akoth","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Pamela Akoth O. is a 24-year-old mother of two children and is raising her kids alone.

ready for their second loan through Esperanza International. They are very proud of themselves for fully paying their first loan and feel good about the fact that Esperanza International has rewarded their good payments with a second loan. Yanilsa V. is the group coordinator. She has two children and lives with her husband. Her children are nine and four years old. The oldest goes to school and the youngest will start in the next school year. She is a home-to-home seller of clothing and shoes. Her mother owns a convenience store so she will use the money from her second loan to set up a display in her mother\u2019s store, which will allow her to offer her products to a wider clientele. Even though right now she sells clothing, Yanilsa is a college student. She plans to major in Education, concentrating in Elementary Education. She hopes to finish her college education in order to accomplish her dream of setting up an elementary school to teach children. Yanilsa is one of the many examples of Esperanza clients who intend to use their businesses to get to a point in their future where they can give back to their communities. Yanilsa believes education can help a person have a better quality of life, which is why she wants to eventually commit her time to teaching children. On behalf of Esperanza International and the Mujeres de Gloria Bank of Hope, thank you for your

The eldest is a sophomore in high school, still undecided on a career. <p>\r\n\r\nSuzana now owns the cafeteria she has been working at since she was a child. It was passed down to her from her parents, and previously by their parents. In her cafeteria, she bakes and sells cakes, pastries, juices etc. She also specializes in baking wedding and birthday cakes.<p>\r\n\r\nThis would be Suzana's fourth loan through Esperanza. With it she plans to purchase ingredients such as flour, butter, and sugar in bulk in order to cut down on her costs, which usually scale up quickly when she buys only small amounts every few days. She hopes to continue to grow her business and improve her living conditions. When her children are old enough to go to college (the eldest in just two years) she hopes the income from her business will be able to pay for their education.<p>\r\n\r\nOne of her long term goals is to continue to push herself in order to provide a better future for her children so they won't have to go through all of the hardships she has gone

Victor's salary as a cook is just not enough to cover all of their household expenses. \r\n\r\nIn her eagerness to help her husband, she joined NWTF-Project Dungganon to have access to loans that would enable her to start a small business. She used the PHP 3,000 first cycle loan to invest in a food vending business, selling a variety of native delicacies within her community. Happy with the results, she continued until she saved enough to put up a general store adjacent to her house, where she sold household commodities that had a fast turnover rate. She's been operating her business for four years now and it earns her an average monthly income of about $115.\r\n\r\nThe previous 6th cycle loan amounted to Php 12,000. She was able to pay her weekly installments and fully paid it within the loan term. Now for her 7th cycle she is borrowing Php 14,000 to use as revolving working capital for her business, and she also plans to invest some of the loan money into selling dried fish.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the call of not just a few, but thousands of women.

G. is a young man of 31 years old who lives with his wife and their three kids in a community called Santa Fe located in Los Chiles, in the province of Alajuela. This community is notably a mountainous area and is close to the northern border of our country. Its principal economic activities are cattle-raising and agriculture, specifically growing basic grain staples, sugar cane and oranges.\r\n\r\nFor a number of years, Don Esteban has worked with cattle, in particular the production of milk and other dairy products. He sells his products to his neighbors in the community who are very satisfied with the quality of the products he offers. \r\n\r\nRight now, Don Esteban would like a loan of \u00a2685.000 (six hundred and eighty-five thousand colones) to buy three additional cows and increase his production. He knows that having more cows will require more work and require a bigger sacrifice. Without a doubt, his desire to be a successful micro-entrepeneur and to help his family get ahead motivate him to work even harder.\r\n\r\nDon Esteban is a member of the Santa Fe Empresa de Cr\u00e9dito Comunal Manantial (Manantial Community Credit Company), one of the 100 partner organizations of EDESA in Costa Rica. This will be his first loan and with the loan he hopes to improve his personal and economic situation. Also, it is clear that due to this type of organization and the convenient access to credit, he can spend more time on productive activities. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Kristina Howe, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":406121,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"Purchase of three milk cows","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CR","country":"Costa Rica","town":"Alajuela","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"10 -84","type":"point"}},"partner_id":127,"posted_date":"2009-10-14T22:50:18Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1200,"lender_count":29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Esteban ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-10-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"CRC","disbursal_amount":685000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":38,"loan_amount":1200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":228333.35},{"due_date":"2011-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":228333.35},{"due_date":"2012-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":228333.3}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":400},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":400},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":400}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":1.87,"local_amount":1068.8,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T12:12:30Z","rounded_local_amount":1088.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103780448},{"amount":0.01,"local_amount":4,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T09:46:59Z","rounded_local_amount":4.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123899962},{"amount":0.28,"local_amount":161.5,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-16T07:37:39Z","rounded_local_amount":164.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":152035474},{"amount":1.68,"local_amount":958.1,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-16T08:26:52Z","rounded_local_amount":975.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159750942},{"amount":396.16,"local_amount":226140.05,"processed_date":"2010-10-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T13:36:59Z","rounded_local_amount":230326.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177391202},{"amount":2.56,"local_amount":1462.2,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T13:44:55Z","rounded_local_amount":1489.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182529649},{"amount":398.72,"local_amount":227602.25,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-25T08:54:18Z","rounded_local_amount":231815.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":240020804},{"amount":398.72,"local_amount":227602,"processed_date":"2012-10-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T12:44:47Z","rounded_local_amount":231815.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315367694}],"funded_date":"2009-10-17T11:05:57Z","paid_date":"2012-11-15T12:44:47Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":148469,"name":"Dorcas","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Dorcas lives in Oyo State, Nigeria.

She lives in the Inga Pirca community, which pertains to the Parish of Santa Ana.  The majority of the people of this parish work in agriculture and livestock.  Also, many of its inhabitants leave for the city in search of better work opportunities in bricklaying and home improvement.  This member is a young, single mother of 22 years old and with a six year old son, whom receives financial support from his father. She lives in her parents' home and contributes towards the household costs.  Ms. Martha coordinates the children centers of her community.  She works very few hours and doesn't have a fixed work schedule since she has to travel to far areas and must leave her home very early and return very late.  During her free time, she weaves, a skill that her mother taught her and also something she learned through weaving courses.

The couple was blessed with six children: Jilmer \u2013 24 years old, high school graduate; Ana \u2013 18 years old, also a high school graduate; Aisa \u2013 13 years old, grade six student; Angelica \u2013 11 years old, grade four; Nimfa \u2013 6 years old, a pre-school student and Shaina, three years old. The family is living in the mountainous place of Hacienda San Antonio in Ilagan, Isabela with an average standard of living. <P>\r\n\r\nAt present, Marcela is asking for financial support that she can use in her farming and hog-raising business.  She is hoping that through the loan amount of PHP 5,000 their businesses will grow.  This will also encourage them to persevere for the improvement of their livelihood and to have a better life in the future. This financial assistance will also be helpful in sending their children to school.  She believes that \u201clife is like a wheel, sometimes you\u2019re on top and sometimes at the bottom\u201d. She believes that someday they will reach the top as long as they join hands and work harder.

Margie has been engaged in her business for over three years and earns approximately 10000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Margie joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 24000 PHP from GDMPC. Margie is requesting a new loan of 24000 PHP which will be used to purchase raw ingredients needed to make products for sale. This loan will be the sixth loan Margie has taken out from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve her family's general living conditions. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.

Tr\u01b0\u01a1ng Th\u1ecb (20201010001) is a 27-year-old female living in the town of Y\u00ean Phong - B\u1eafc Ninh.  She is married and has two children.  To make a living, M. sells bicycles in the local community.  M. has been engaged in this business for over five years and earns approximately $255 a month from this activity.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 2009, M. joined SEDA to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  M. has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5.152.000 VND from SEDA.  This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell.  M. is now requesting a new loan of 8.288.000 VND which will be used to invest in expanding the business.  This will be her 2nd loan from SEDA.  M. plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout SEDA:\r\n\r\nThe mission of SEDA (Center of Small Enterprise Development Assistance) is to provide micro-finance services to the low income and disadvantaged people in rural areas of Hanoi and the Northern provinces of Vietnam.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in Vietnamese while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\r\n\r\n\r\nM.

She is the mother of four children, three of whom are married and live separately while the other one attends school. \r\n\r\nMean K. has been engaged in a business weaving fishnets for more than 10 years.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He has a home that is modest, but very cozy, that he built himself out of wood.  Roberto cultivates cocoa and bananas in the village of Triboline, located in the Huanta district.  For 30 years he has worked alone in the fields.  From 6 in the morning, at daybreak, Roberto begins his routine life: tilling, watering, and ensuring that pests do not harm his crops.

He loves to work on his farm, because he really enjoys the natural setting.  But at times he gets angry if his hired workers don't do the work correctly, as he would like them to do it. Now he is content and tranquil, because he knows that the sale of his crops is profitable.  Cocoa is marketed in the collection centers in his town, while he sends his bananas to the city of Ayacucho, where he has customers that wait for the arrival of his quality fruit.  In the future, he plans to buy more agricultural land to increase his production and improve his sales.  This is his first loan with MFP, and he assures us that he will not fall behind on his payments because he does not want to let down his communal bank, since they gave him the confidence to work together.

Su mayor desaf\u00edo es la falta de capital de trabajo,  para dar respuesta r\u00e1pida a sus clientes  y esto es lo que justamente conseguir\u00e1 con su credikiva:  un capital nuevo para comprar de contado y en volumen,  mercanc\u00edas como art\u00edculos para el hogar, adornos navide\u00f1os, regalos de amor y amistad, todo esto teniendo en cuenta,  que es el segundo semestre del a\u00f1o y se acerca una \u00e9poca de gran despliegue de ventas y Yolbin sabe que es tiempo de repunte de ventas. ","en":"Yolbin is 34 years old and lives to the south of the city with her husband and two children (ages 18 and 10).  She has a store where she sells various merchandise, but she also offers products through specialty catalogs of major companies.  When she started her business, Yolbin was excited about being able to help with the household expenses and achieve greater well-being.  She began selling shoes, but later added products through catalogs.  As a result, she built up her own capital which she used to increase her sales.  Today she also has a display case on the terrace of her house and shelves where she can show off the products that she sells.  Her goal moving forward is to convert her variety shop into a large store where current and potential customers can come to buy everything they need and want.  The main products that she sells are perfumes, cosmetics, cards, miscellaneous items, and household appliances by request.  Yolbin takes into account what is lacking in her displays.  Her main suppliers are the warehouses in the central part of the city and the specialty catalogs that frequently advertise good promotional offers.  Her business is managed by her uncle since she works at a part-time job in the mornings to earn income.  In the afternoons, Yolbin takes over her business.  Competition is high, but there is much public demand to generate income for all the businesses.  Her greatest challenge is the lack of operating capital that would enable her to respond quickly to her customers.  This is exactly why she is applying for a Kiva loan.  \r\n<p>\r\nHaving this new capital will enable her to buy merchandise with cash and in bulk such as household goods, Christmas decorations, and gifts for Colombian Valentine\u2019s Day.  Yolbin is taking into consideration that this is the second half of the year when a large number of products are introduced to sell.  Therefore, she should see a spike in sales.    \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":864514,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home

","en":"Don Juan Rafael, age 58, was born in Le\u00f3n, is single, and is the owner of general store. He only reached the second grade. \r\n\r\nHe started his business nine years ago. Regretful of not having any children of his own, he does have some nieces who he helped raise and who have helped him to set up his store. He makes a living through this business, given that at his age it's quite difficult to get other work. That's why he wound up establishing his humble store, which is small but offers kind and welcoming service. He needs this loan to buy rice, sugar, beans, oil, bread, milk, eggs, juice, soft drinks, butter, meat, canned foods, sweets, soaps, detergents, and bleach. \r\n\r\nHe hopes to someday build his store into a general distributor supplying everything needed to meet the basic needs of his neighborhood. \r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":901507,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy rice, sugar, beans, oil, bread, milk, eggs, juice, soft drinks, butter, meat, canned foods, sweets, soaps, detergents, and bleach. \r\n","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Leon","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.435556 -86.879444","type":"point"}},"partner_id":176,"posted_date":"2011-10-22T20:40:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":450,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juan Rafael ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-10-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":439.61,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":43.97},{"due_date":"2011-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":43.96},{"due_date":"2012-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":43.96},{"due_date":"2012-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":43.96},{"due_date":"2012-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":43.96},{"due_date":"2012-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":43.96},{"due_date":"2012-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":43.96},{"due_date":"2012-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":43.96},{"due_date":"2012-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":43.96},{"due_date":"2012-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":43.96}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.01},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.99},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":90.01,"local_amount":87.93,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:47:40Z","rounded_local_amount":90.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250832674},{"amount":45,"local_amount":43.96,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:15:43Z","rounded_local_amount":45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257242593},{"amount":45,"local_amount":43.96,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:27:26Z","rounded_local_amount":45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263381866},{"amount":45,"local_amount":43.96,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:26:51Z","rounded_local_amount":45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270095409},{"amount":44.99,"local_amount":43.96,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T10:27:44Z","rounded_local_amount":44.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276710039},{"amount":45,"local_amount":43.96,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-16T08:46:28Z","rounded_local_amount":45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283403479},{"amount":68.25,"local_amount":66.67,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:47:09Z","rounded_local_amount":68.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287428434},{"amount":66.75,"local_amount":65.21,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-16T09:06:12Z","rounded_local_amount":66.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294613170}],"funded_date":"2011-12-09T08:41:12Z","paid_date":"2012-08-16T09:06:12Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jacob Bintliff","image":789150}},{"id":354145,"name":"Leybin Guadalupe","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Leybin Guadalupe tiene 25 a\u00f1os, su actividad es un kiosco hace tiempo que tiene este medio de vida.

Emilia creates clothing for women such as lingerie and underwear for children. She began the business with financial support that was enough to buy her first sewing machine that she set up in her own home.\n\nHer first customers were her relatives but little by little she won more clients among her friends and neighbors, thanks to the good work she learned from her sister 15 years ago. Currently she is studying in a vocational training center in order to become perfect. \n\nWhat she likes about her work is being able to focus and remain busy permitting her to have income, in order to give a better quality of life to her family. On the other hand, what bothers her is the physical fatigue from being in the same position for many hours, but this does not dishearten her and she hopes to be able to open a boutique in her own home.\n\nThis will be her first loan with MFP, therefore she is waiting for assistance, in order to continue with her plans and she promises to make her payments on time, once again, in order to have a good credit record. She likes being a part of the communal bank because all the people are trustworthy and very supportive.\n\nWith the 1000 soles from the loan she will buy a new sewing machine costing 700 soles and the balance will be used to buy sewing supplies such as fabrics, thread, and other items.  \n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":935547,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to buy a sewing machine and supplies such as fabric and thread.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-12-06T19:30:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Emilia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-11-05T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":148.06},{"due_date":"2012-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":158.85},{"due_date":"2012-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":158.09},{"due_date":"2012-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":172.15},{"due_date":"2012-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":179.37},{"due_date":"2012-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":183.48}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.52},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.57},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.29},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.55},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.27},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.8}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":55.52,"local_amount":148.06,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:51:27Z","rounded_local_amount":149.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250836256},{"amount":59.57,"local_amount":158.85,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:19:23Z","rounded_local_amount":160.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257246017},{"amount":59.29,"local_amount":158.09,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:32:16Z","rounded_local_amount":159.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263386044},{"amount":64.55,"local_amount":172.15,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:30:44Z","rounded_local_amount":174.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270099133},{"amount":136.07,"local_amount":362.85,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T10:29:49Z","rounded_local_amount":367.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276713293}],"funded_date":"2011-12-13T18:48:41Z","paid_date":"2012-05-15T10:29:49Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Gail LeGrand","image":190313}},{"id":370533,"name":"Pov","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Pov is 40 years old,  married, and has two children.

She is married and her husband's name is Ladislao Cespedes.  They have 5 children and they all go to school which is about 8 blocks from their home.<p>\r\nShe makes chipas and she sells them by travelling all around the neighborhoods in different cities.  Chipa is a traditional food and very popular in Paraguay.  It's similar to bread and it's made out of starch, cheese, milk, vegetable oil, etc.  She has a small shop in her home where she makes her chipas and her family help her make around 200 chipas a day.  The cities where she makes most of her money are San Lorenzo and Fernando de la Mora which are located one hour away from Caacupe.<p>\r\nMarta tells us that with this job, she and her husband have been able to have a roof over their head, provide food for their family and provide an education to their children.  Lately sales have been low and to be able to sell all her chipas, Marta has to walk all around town until she sells all her chipas because if she doesn't sell them then she doesn't make money.<p>\r\nShe also tells us that she went to many different lending institutions to try to get a loan, but nobody was willing to let her borrow money since she doesn't have many references\/credentials.  Fundacion Paraguaya was the only one who helped her to get a loan .  Thanks to that loan she was able to build a brick oven because previously she was renting her neighbor's brick oven to make her chipas.<p>\r\nAt this time she is requesting a loan to purchase main ingredients such as eggs, milk, starch and cheese.<p>\r\n<p><b>Translated from Spanish by Carolina Zelaya-Kronlund, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nLa se\u00f1ora Marta, tiene 41 a\u00f1os, ella es casada, su marido se llama Ladislao C\u00e9spedes y tienen 5 hijos; todos van a la escuela que queda a 8 cuadras de su domicilio.\r\nElla elabora y vende chipas de forma ambulante, recorriendo barrios de diferentes ciudades.

They are all businesswomen in Makeni, the northern provincial headquarters town. They have been together as a group with SMT for the past year. Previously, SMT loaned these women Le 600,000.00 each. This they have repaid successfully and are now requesting a new loan. \r\nThe previous loan had a lot of impact on their lives but they still need more loans to further empower themselves in their businesses. <P>\r\n\r\nTheir leader is Fatmata F.. Fatmata was born here in Makeni 25 years ago. She is married with two school-going children. Both she and her husband, who is a teacher, are responsible for their children's schooling and welfare. <P>\r\n\r\nThrough her cotton trade, Fatmata is able to meet most of her financial needs. She has been in the cotton business for the past two years now. Fatima is doing fine in her business, but still faces a lot of challenges.

She is now requesting a loan in the amount of $125 that she will use for her vending business.  Violeta is also planning to start in the hog raising business if she ever has extra money.  She dreams that her younger children will finish their studies and have a better job in the future.  \r\n\r\nShe has seven children: Rosemarie, thirty-one years old and a high school graduate; Rodel, twenty-nine years old and a high school undergraduate; Romalyn, twenty-three years old and in college; Rosel, twenty-one years old and a nursing student; Roby-Ann, eighteen years old and a high school graduate; Jenny Mae, seventeen years old and a high school student; and Richelle, the youngest, is twelve years old and presently in elementary school.

She practically inherited the sales post from her father and since then she wakes up before dawn everyday and at 3 in the morning she starts to list what she needs to buy at the wholesale market, leaving her children in the care of her husband. With her profits she has started building a second floor on the home given to her by her mother-in-law, and also help out with family expenses like the water and electric bill. Maria tells us this is very tough work but it has its rewards, so she works a lot and in the future she would like to buy a car that she can use for a taxi service.

She owns a business venture, providing dress making services to local community members.  Ivapene has 5 years of experience in this business.  Ivapene needs a loan of WST $2500 to purchase used sewing machine.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 450 tala or US $188 per week) to financially support immediate members of her family.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Ivapene joined SPBD.  This is her 4th loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Ivapene's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Ivapene L. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.4 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.4 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.4 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              1.4 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.

This area is known for being very commercial.

Her eldest is in elementary school.  Her husband is a salesman.\r\n\r\nSonia is a good housewife who is taking out this loan for her husband so that he can get ahead in his business and improve their family's well-being.

is Agrifina, 44, a resident of Caloocan City, Philippines. She is married and a mother to her children. She manages their household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.  \r\n\r\nAgrifina operates a garlic and onion retail business. Garlic and onions are the staples of Filipino cuisine. Every dish must contain either one or both of these. She purchases wholesale onions and garlic, cleans and peels them, repackages them into 5- or 10-Philippine peso-bags, and then sells them. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 500 Philippine pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue the operations of her business, she is requesting a 22,000 PHP loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy additional stock of sacks of garlic and onions for her business. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nAgrifina hopes to be able to expand soon, just as she hopes to give her children a good and high quality education through all her hard work in her business.

Del Carmen","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mercedes' name merits an explanation. Although it seems to be a long name, it really is a commonly used form to name someone in the Dominican Republic, and in general, in Hispanic cultures. Her second last name, \"Del Carmen\", is given after the patron saint \"Del Carmen Virgin\" from the Catholic tradition of having patron \"Mother of God\" who bears different name depending on where it is that it's used as such. It isn't strange to find that this particular \"Virgin\" is popular in the island of Puerto Rico. Insofar as her last name is concerned, the \"D. L.\"  stands for the origins of her ancestors: the Province of \"L.\" in Spain. Her second last name, R., is as common as the name \"Smith\" may be in certain parts of the U.S.A.\r\n<p>\r\nMercedes had 9 children, but today she only has one living with her.  Her husband died some time ago, and now she must care for her recently injured son. He was procuring the food for their plates, but fell from the motorbike on which he gave rides for a living. He is now living with a cast and there\u2019s no certainty as to when or how he will be able to riD. the bike again. Regardless, Mercedes now wants (and as well needs) to put up a cafeteria for which she has most of the utensils (such as the thermos to keep the liquids hot, such as coffee and milk), the toaster for the bread, the blender for the fruit juices, etc. She needs a \u201cplace\u201d to do it in, and needs to buy the raw materials. Hence, she\u2019s taking this loan. <p>She used to have a small grocery store earlier on, but now decided to put up the cafeteria (right where she is standing in the picture)  because in the time between when she had the grocery store and now, she feels there have been too many stores put up in the neighborhood. She reminded us that these are good businesses (300% profit margin), but \u201cyou can\u2019t have too many of them close by\u2026\u201d."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":58094,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cafe","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Build infrastructure for a cafeteria","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"DO","country":"Dominican Republic","town":"Los Alcarrizos","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"18.516667 -70.016667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":66,"posted_date":"2007-09-03T06:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":275,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mercedes Del Carmen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-09-17T11:55:35Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":275,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2007-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2007-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2008-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2008-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2008-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":45.85}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2008-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":45.85}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":46,"local_amount":46,"processed_date":"2007-10-17T09:23:40Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-17T10:25:38Z","rounded_local_amount":46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":68678},{"amount":46,"local_amount":46,"processed_date":"2007-11-17T10:26:21Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-17T10:25:38Z","rounded_local_amount":46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":82867},{"amount":46,"local_amount":46,"processed_date":"2007-12-17T10:29:17Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-17T10:25:38Z","rounded_local_amount":46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":98563},{"amount":46,"local_amount":46,"processed_date":"2008-01-17T10:15:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-17T10:25:38Z","rounded_local_amount":46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":117254},{"amount":46,"local_amount":46,"processed_date":"2008-02-17T10:15:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-17T10:25:38Z","rounded_local_amount":46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":137232},{"amount":45,"local_amount":45,"processed_date":"2008-03-17T10:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-17T10:25:38Z","rounded_local_amount":45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159989}],"funded_date":"2007-09-03T11:55:35Z","paid_date":"2008-03-17T10:09:36Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":21399,"name":"Najiba","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Najiba Quilyeva is a 37-year-old farmer who keeps poultry  for selling in  Bilasuvar in the southern region of Azerbaijan.

Entonces decidi\u00f3 independizarse con la finalidad de  mejorar su capital de trabajo e invertir en mayor cantidad de productos y que con el paso del tiempo lograr instalar en su casa un bazar donde pueda ofrecer estos productos y brindar algunos talleres de maquillaje. Sin embargo, para llegar a su meta tiene que salir todas las tardes a visitar a diversos clientes en sus respectivas viviendas para mostrarles el cat\u00e1logo o los cosm\u00e9ticos que tiene en stock.

Before starting her own business she used to help a friend sell these products and with a little experience realized that this business could be very profitable due to the large number of orders that she received from family and friends. Karim decided to establish her own business with the goal of making a solid profit and investing it in a large variety of products, in addition to eventually establishing a makeup studio and store in her own home where she could offer these products. Nevertheless, to accomplish this goal, Karim spends every afternoon visiting various clients in their homes to show them new catalogues and cosmetics that she has in stock.\r\n\r\nThis is Karim's eighth loan with MFP and what she loves most about her loan group is the responsibility and dynamism with which they work.

After obtaining her bachelor\u2019s degree, she had no financial support to continue with her studies. She started selling small pastries in 2003.\r\n\r\nShe wants to use this loan to strengthen her activities by buying two bags of flour, baking powder, vanilla, containers of margarine, a 25kg bag of sugar, and a can of oil.\r\n\r\nShe uses different strategies for a quick turnover: she delivers her cakes, madeleines, waffles and sweet rolls in the neighboring shops, at the market, and she also sells baked goods from her home. \r\n\r\nIn the future, she plans to open a pastry shop and hire two or three employees. She wants to use her savings to support her family and pay for her children\u2019s tuition. She is a quiet woman with a good reputation around her neighborhood and at the church where she receives communion. \r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Nathalie Pelletier, Kiva

They are petty-businesspeople who have come to SMT, a partner of Kiva, in order to seek a loan of SLL 1,000,000 for each member of the group. With this loan, they will be able to add more goods to their businesses, attract more customers, make more sales and profit and, consequently, improve their living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe leader of this group of entrepreneurs is Mohamed K. who is pictured on the right.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  Even today, Tajikistan is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New Western culture, and Central Asian traditions. \r\n\r\nTajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 percent of the country is mountainous and only 7 percent of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve their agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients have the opportunity to support themselves through viable businesses. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

G.","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mambo (Greetings!) from Tanzania! This is 40-year old Rebecca K. from Mbeya. She is single with two children, between the ages of 10 and 14. She is also responsible for supporting one dependant because he is an orphan. Rebecca has been running a local restaurant known as \u201cmama lishe\u201d since 1998. When you see a SELFINA entrepreneur whose business title is \u2018restaurant\u2019 or \u2018caf\u00e9\u2019, you may have to adjust your mental image of what that is. A local restaurant or caf\u00e9 in Tanzania usually consists of a rough wooden table and some long, wooden benches, with the sky as a ceiling. Such places don\u2019t even appear in the Lonely Planet\u2019s budget guide, but if you\u2019re looking for a cheap and tasty meal, and someone to have a chat with, this is the place to be. The food is all local: rice, ugali (a hot sticky dough, made from maize flour), plantain (a cooked savory banana), all served with beans, vegetables, meat, and a variety of yummy sauces.\n\nShe works at the business for 9-12 hours per day, 6 days per week. Four employees assist her. Rebecca currently earns about $250 USD a month from her business. She is requesting a loan of $550 USD in order to make improvements to her restaurant and quality. In the future, she plans to start a new business. Rebecca thanks you for your support!\n\nABOUT SELFINA:\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":288114,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Restaurant","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To

She is 59 years old. Arceli is the group leader of a 4-member group loan offered by PMPC. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nArceli is married and has 3 adult children. Arceli owns & operates a farming business. The main source of income for the business comes from planting & harvesting rice for sale. Arceli has been engaged in her business for over 40 years and earns approximately 7,000 PHP a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2004, Arceli joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. Arceli has successfully repaid a previous loan  from PMPC. Arceli is requesting a new loan of 14,900 PHP which will be used to purchase fertilizers such as manure. This loan will be the 8th loan taken out by Arceli from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated to improve and expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Florence wants to use this loan to buy more bunches of bananas. Besides this banana business, she is also a poultry farmer and even owns rental rooms.  Her customers are the community around her home. Florence works seven days a week. Her business challenges are seasonal (like high banana prices) and defaulters. She aspires to educate her children up to university and to start going to Masaka for bananas.

The cold winter season which has been hitting the city has caused his sales to fall and also made it difficult to get around but he is optimistic about the approaching summer and the Christmas period which is the best season of the year.  Rafael has three children who support him completely in his business because it makes income for his household and, above all, because the physical activity keeps him in a perfect state of

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The New Orleans location flooded, resulting in a total loss. \r\n\r\nGloria says that Hurricane Katrina was a two-fold experience. \"Yes, it was very stressful and emotional, but after the storm, we were able to build an industry name for ourselves, \" explains Gloria. Recovery was slow after the storm and not many businesses were open, but The Laundry Center's Jefferson location was open. The customer loyalty that they had gained over the years allowed the store to prosper and continue providing services to original customers, as well as new customers. \r\n\r\nGloria is confident that her business will continue to grow and she hopes to expand the services provided to include pickup and delivery service for large corporations such as hotels and airports. \r\n\r\nGloria is extremely grateful for the Kiva program, as she would not have been able to get financing through any other source because of the losses her business experienced due to the storm. \r\n\r\nGloria will use the

He is married and has eleven children, who are all in school. He runs a Micro-Distribution Centre (MDC), where he sells Coca-Cola products wholesale to local retailers and customers in his hometown of Lusaka. He has been running this business since 1995, and it is his only source of income. Gryson describes himself as persistent and hardworking. These qualities have helped him continue running his business. He says the main challenge that he faces is that he does not have enough working capital to increase his stock levels. He has empty crates of soft drinks, but does not have the $3000 required for him to buy more soft drinks. Gryson believes that the Kiva loan will help him alleviate his major challenge of lack of stock. He is hopeful that by getting a Kiva loan, he will be able to expand his business and earn more profit so that he can provide a better life for his family.

He is married and the father of five children, three of whom attend school. He is a farmer in Ahovil\u00e8kom\u00e8 village in the Ou\u00e9m\u00e9 valley and is a member of the HOUEDOME group GH AYIDOTE MINAWANOU. The inhabitants of this village work the land after the fall of the level of the Ou\u00e9m\u00e9 river. Their land is rich and offers a high yield. Their main activity is growing corn, peppers, vegetables, okra, tomatoes and manioc. The problem for these riverside residents is that, during the flood period, they no longer have anything to do and spend all the income generated from the sale of their harvested produce. When the river level drops they do not have any money left to pay for the workforce essential for sowing the available land. The local practice of selling cheaply the harvest does not provide them with financial security and further bankrupts them. This practice involves selling the future harvest at a rock-bottom price to an affluent person in order to have the required money to continue farming. Tired of this practice, they are requesting a loan of 100 000 FCFA (USD 200) to farm about 1 hectares of the aforementioned land. <p> \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by V\u00e9ronique Fourment, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":237242,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To farm one hectare of corn and peppers.

This is 30-year-old Lebia M. from Tukuyu. She is married with four children between the ages of 1 and 12. Lebia has been running a shoe-selling business since 2007. Her business is to purchase shoes on a wholesale basis and sell them on a retail basis.\r\n<p>\r\nShe works at the business for 12 hours per day, six days per week. Lebia currently earns about $100 a month from her business. She is requesting a loan of $400 in order to purchase more shoes in bulk. In the future, she plans to increase the quantity and the range of her business. Lebia thanks you for your support!\r\n<p>\r\nABOUT SELFINA\r\n<p>\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through micro-leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility.\r\n<p>\r\nCustoms and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.\r\n<p>\r\nOne of the primary advantages of micro-leasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.
