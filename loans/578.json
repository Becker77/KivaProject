She is a member of the communal bank Damas del Oriente or \u201cLadies of the Orient\u201d.  Her bank is so named because the bank members live in an asentamiento humano (or, legalized squatter settlement) named Villa Oriente.\r\n\r\nThe asentamiento humano is located in the Ucayali region of Per\u00fa.  Asentamientos humanos are formed when immigrants from other parts of the region invaden, or literally, \u201cinvade\u201d an abandoned section of land outside of an urban area.  These immigrants may come from other Peruvian metropolises or from villages in the sierras or the jungle, but all come with the dual purpose of finding work and owning their own home.\r\n\r\nErika moved to Villa Oriente three months after the neighborhood was officially formed in 2005.  Currently, Erika works selling breakfast along the side of the regional highway from 4am to 7am in the morning.  She has to get up at 3:00 am to prepare patarashka (fish wrapped in banana leaves and grilled on an open flame) and tacacho (green banana mixed with pork rinds mashed into a ball) to sell.  At nights, Erika studies to earn her high school degree.\r\n\r\nErika is requesting 2,500 Nuevo Soles to purchase cooking oils, plates and cups for her business.  Erika says her business allows her to buy school materials for herself and motivates her to keep studying to earn her degree.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":251719,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To purchase cooking oils, plates and cups for her business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Pucallpa-Ucayali","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":72,"posted_date":"2009-01-08T22:50:12Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":800,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Erika","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":625}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":200}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":200,"local_amount":625,"processed_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T13:44:21Z","rounded_local_amount":627.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":10225221},{"amount":200,"local_amount":625,"processed_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T19:47:49Z","rounded_local_amount":627.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20418004},{"amount":200,"local_amount":625,"processed_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:14:15Z","rounded_local_amount":627.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27111456},{"amount":200,"local_amount":625,"processed_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:17:03Z","rounded_local_amount":627.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36006643}],"funded_date":"2009-01-09T17:27:30Z","paid_date":"2009-05-15T21:17:03Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Erin Lariviere","image":null}},{"id":86603,"name":"Ivetti  Nelly","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Ivetti es socia del Bancomunal Las Orqu\u00eddeas. \nIvetti es casada, tiene 50 a\u00f1os, estudio industria del vestido en al universidad San Mart\u00edn.

As for the peanut butter and the peanuts, they are sold in the San market, from home and door-to-door for cash.\r\n\r\nDuring this loan cycle, each member of the group expects to make an average profit of 35,000 FCFA, which will be used to repay the loan interest, provide for the needs of the extended family and the remainder will be invested in the business.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Alison Dent, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":296627,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"To buy peanuts and condiments","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Koutiala","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2009-04-01T07:00:54Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":525,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Setou Yakou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sitan","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Magna ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatoumata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dj\u00e9n\u00e9ba","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Karia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sali ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alima ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Setou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-03-03T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":250000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2009-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2009-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":41666.67,"processed_date":"2009-04-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:27:45Z","rounded_local_amount":43526.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36033762},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":41666.67,"processed_date":"2009-05-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:38:17Z","rounded_local_amount":43526.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44621134},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":41666.67,"processed_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:20:52Z","rounded_local_amount":43526.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53020097},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":41666.67,"processed_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T19:18:37Z","rounded_local_amount":43526.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63242849},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":41666.67,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T19:23:45Z","rounded_local_amount":43526.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63242850},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":41666.65,"processed_date":"2009-08-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T22:46:50Z","rounded_local_amount":43526.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73678485}],"funded_date":"2009-04-05T16:46:13Z","paid_date":"2009-09-15T22:46:50Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":102987,"name":"Oyatullo","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"N.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She explains that the main source of income from the business comes primarily through the planting and harvesting of corn and bananas for sale.  Jorinda has been engaged in her business for over 15 years, and she earns approximately 4,000 PHP per month for these activities. <p>\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Jorinda joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services and to thereby help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities.  Notably, Jorinda has already successfully repaid a previous loan in the amount of 5,000 PHP from GDMPC.  Jorinda is now requesting a new loan in the amount of 8,000 PHP ($175), which will be used to purchase fertilizers and additional crops for sale.  This loan will be the second loan taken out by Jorinda from GDMPC.  She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business as a result of this loan to improve and expand her business and to help pay for her children's school tuition. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.

They are blessed with 3 young school-aged children. The family lives in the Prk. Waling, Waling Brgy, Busay Bago City, Negros Occidental. \r\n\r\nGeorgita has a general store, a rice business, and also sells gasoline to earn additional income to help her husband sustain the needs of the family and meet their dreams in life. She started her business when she joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2001, because she knew that if her husband alone had to generate all of the family's income, it might be too much pressure on him.  She was even worried that their children would not be able to finish their studies. But through their cooperative efforts, she and her husband are reaching for their dreams, but helping each other support their family. Now she earns a minimum monthly income of PHP 6,000, a portion of which she sets aside for the education of their children.\r\n\r\nShe borrowed PHP 8,000 with her previous loan, and used it as additional capital for her general store and other businesses. She was able to earn and repay her loan every week without delay and she was able to fully pay her loan within term. Now, for her 17th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 11,000 to be used as additional working capital for her businesses.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling food and daily use products in the local community. Saturnina has been working in this business for over 20 years.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Saturnina joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Saturnina has successfully repaid a previous loan from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional products to sell. Saturnina is requesting a new loan which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This loan will be the 7th loan taken out by Saturnina from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand the borrower's business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines.

She works in her 's business, planting & harvesting taro for sale.  Karoline has 4 years of experience in this business.  Karoline needs a loan of WST $2000 to purchase weed-killers such as Gramoxome.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 450 talas or US $188 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Karoline joined SPBD.  This is her 5th loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Karoline's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Karoline etelo are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.87 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              2 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         2 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\"\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

She sells grains and groceries.  10 years ago, when she first began her business, she was the only one that sold these products in her community, but now there is a lot of competition.  As a result, Gregoria now sells her merchandise in neighboring communities, such as Lircay.  The loan that she is seeking would help her purchase grains in bulk and boxes of refreshments.  Gregoria's dream is to have a large store full of merchandise.  She believes that she can achieve it.  \r\n\r\nFrancisca is married and has 3 children, ages 14, 18, and 20.  She sells cheese and ice-cream.  She started her business by buying a freezer and making popsicles and ice-cream to sell at schools and local festivals.  Francisca wants to change her business and plans to invest her future loan in the purchase of animals to raise and sell, thus increasing her capital.  Her dream is to sell her ice-cream in other communities and at the same time prepare fruit yogurts.      \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Tracy Quan, Kiva

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists, and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to epic mountain passes, communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture, and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 percent of the country is mountainous, leaving only 7 percent arable land. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

And during the winter season she prepares fruit preserves. She comments that she learned this business by teaching herself and she has been doing it for 10 years. With time, she has increased the number of customers. Since the same clients are the ones who promote her products, she now has a fixed customer base. She buys her supplies, such glass jars, in the city of Santiago, and she gets the fruits in the city of Quill\u00f3n. With her loan she will buy big pots, in which she will cook the fruit and make it, for example, into marmalade, and in addition, she will buy seasonal fruit. One of her goals for her business is to participate in a course that the municipality offers to perfect her products. Another of her goals is to have a shop in her own house, where she can offer and sell her products. \r\n\r\nVer\u00f3nica lives with her husband and their three daughters, ages 25, 21, and 20, who are studying for professional careers, a situation which makes Ver\u00f3nica very happy and proud.

In addition, she is very happy and thankful to participate in Fondo Esperanza, since it has permitted her to invest in her business. Apart from this, the training sessions, with the training in accounting, have been a great contribution to her business, since it has permitted her to invest and distribute her income better.\r\n\r\nFrom another perspective, the community bank, of which she is a part, is very united, committed, and supportive, so Veronica feels very comfortable and happy.\r\n\r\nConcepci\u00f3n is located at the mouth of the B\u00edob\u00edo river, one of the largest rivers in the country, in the south of Chile in the B\u00edob\u00edo region. It has had an important role in our history, being the site of important battles and related agreements, especially during the war of Arauco, because it was on the frontier of the Mapuche territory. Now the city has experienced important economic and demographic development and has come to be considered one of the most relevant urban, demographic, administrative, financial and commercial centers of Chile, after Santiago and

She is 37 years old, and she comes from a poor family. She is married and has 3 children. Two years ago, while jobless, she decided to open her own business. Shokhret and her husband (see photo) rented space, bought tables and chairs, dishes and equipment for a cafe. But returns from the business were so low that Shokhret did not have the money to fix up the old cafe and as a result her clients started to leave the business. In order to stop clients from leaving, Shokhret asked for a $500 loan from the Norwegian Microcredit partner of Kiva.

Today, BRAC has emerged as an independent, virtually self-financed paradigm in sustainable human development. It is one of the largest Southern development organizations employing over 100,000 people, 61% of which are women, and working with the twin objectives of poverty alleviation and empowerment of the poor. Diagnosing poverty in human terms and recognizing its multifaceted nature, BRAC approaches poverty alleviation with a holistic approach.\r\n<br><br>The successes of BRAC in the international development arena have stimulated a series of discussions, both with African delegations, who have visited BRAC programs, and with donors who work in Asia and Africa. Both the African countries and the donors have encouraged BRAC to join the development campaign in Africa to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and more recently to join the campaign of \u201cending poverty\u201d, which is an area where Africa represents the greatest global challenge.\r\n<br><br> In Uganda, BRAC registered as a Non Government Organization (NGO) in January 2006 to undertake programs in Education, Health, Water & Sanitation, Agriculture & Livestock and Microfinance. The Microfinance and Education are the pioneer programs launched in Uganda and, as of July 2007, had served 21,273 borrowers and enrolled 1,155 adolescents in its education

It is also known for its famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi, and many others. The country, filled with epic mountain passes, is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, and boasts a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 percent of the country is mountainous and only 7 percent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\nMore about IMON International\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition.

Her work activity is selling food, which she has done for more than 11 years. She started this business because she is a very hardworking woman; she has always liked advancing in business, that's why she begins to cook very early in order to have food ready to sell on the streets. Josefa fills a basket everyday with the food she sells. At first, she only made fast food such as 'gallo pinto' (a dish of mixed rice and beans, called 'mottled rooster'), eggs, fried cheese and aged cheese.

She is 43 years old. Her husband, Rene, works as a fisherman and sometimes as a carpenter. She has three children who are between 11 and 16 years old and they are all presently studying. This couple help each other provide a better future for their children by sending them to school so that they can get a proper education and be able to improve their living conditions. They also work hard because they want to provide a comfortable life for their youngest daughter who has special needs. They plan to send her to Bacolod for special education.\r\n<p>\r\nAlma decided to start a business because she saw that her husband's income was not secure, and she was afraid that if she couldn\u2019t help her husband by earning even a little income, maybe someday they would not be able to afford the education of their children and not have a stable future. This is the reason she joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1996 \u2013 so that she could access much needed capital to put up a general store and have an independent income. As her income capacity increased, she started selling vinegar and later frozen products, earning a good income. Her businesses now earns her 15,000 Philippine pesos (PHP) per month. She saves most of her profit for the education of her older children and medication for her special child.\r\n<p>\r\nAlma's previous loan of 19,000 PHP was used as additional working capital for her general store. It was fully repaid without delay and now she wants to borrow 19,500 PHP (her ninth loan) to buy a refrigerator for her general store for the frozen products she sells. \r\n<p>\r\n<b>About NWTF:<\/b>\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means \"Honorable\"). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them <i>dungganon<\/i> - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of the community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":433938,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

She has 4 children between the ages of 12 and 27-years-old. Since a very young age she's known the fishing business well because she comes from a family of fishermen. From that background came the idea to have a small commercial fishing company, and this initiative helped develop her skills as a businesswoman. From this knowledge comes also the transportation service that she provides in her town, where it's typical to get from one place to another on motorcycles. \r\n\r\nFor more than 23 years she has sold fish. Her husband is a well-known fisherman in Palermo, a port in Barranquilla, and people come to their home to buy the fish because they know that Luz Marina offers the freshest and healthiest fish every day. Thanks to her work she managed to buy a house and and save enough income to start her motorcycle transport service. She and her siblings have been connected for serveral years with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo and they know the organization very well. Currently she's applying to obtain this Kiva loan with which she will buy a canoe, which will help her ensure the stability of her product. The canoe they currently work with is small and in poor condition. With the loans from this organization she's managed to buy a smoke chiller, increase her income and, above all, build her credit. Her biggest challenge is when the fish supply is low and it becomes difficult to meet the demand of her customers. The solution to this is the purchase of a bigger canoe in perfect condition. Her dreams are focused on the expansion of her business because she knows well that increasing her services will help her buy a new motorcycle for her transport business, which is another generator of income that will help improve her family's quality of life. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Kate Richardson, Kiva

Pedro tiene planeado invertir el cr\u00e9dito solicitado en la compra de materiales para refaccionar el techo de la pieza de su casa que la convertir\u00e1 en tienda; adem\u00e1s empezar\u00e1  a comprar mercader\u00eda en comestibles para comenzar con el negocio.\n\n","en":"Pedro, 36, lives with his wife Maribel, age 42, and their 10 year old daughter. Together they struggle every day to get ahead. For the past 12 years he has been in the transportation industry, first as a fare collector on a bus, but the salary was low and he had greater aspirations. For that reason he started working as a \"datero\" for the same company. This job entails reporting on the schedules for various buses, information which he passes along to the drivers and  keeps a record for the company. \r\n\r\nPedro works from 6 a.m. to 7 p.m. and is happy with his job as it's quite interesting. Since he is an entrepreneurial man he plans to start a small general store in his home. This is his first loan with MFP and he promises to pay back on time since he doesn't want to let his friend in the group down since she is also hard working like him. He also doesn't want to let all the people who made this loan possible down since it will allow him to keep working. \r\n\r\nPedro plans to invest the loan in the purchase of materials to repair the roof in the area of his house where his store will be. He will also start buying inventory for the business.

She is a mother of 7 children and three grandchildren with 6 great grand children aged between 10 and 6 years. She lives with her 90-year-old husband and her great grand children. Makhothatso finds life very difficult seeing that both she and her husband are unemployed and find means of living from pension and crop farming. They live in a traditional hut that is not well ventilated, nor does it warm up well in winter. \n\nTogether with her husband, she works long hours to ensure there is enough food for her family, some of whom are going to school and only help her in the field on Saturdays and Sundays. She has to wake up very early, between 4am and 5am, during the week to start preparing the fire for cooking breakfast, heating water, and warming the house for all the children before they go to school. Collecting firewood, setting up the fire, and doing the actual cooking demands a lot of her time. \n\nTemperatures in the Lesotho highlands are never really high. Winters can get very cold, and often Makhothatso has to start the fire inside her hut. Starting a fire releases smog and smoke, which when inhaled in large quantities over a period of time can lead to lung diseases, eye problems, and in the worst case, death. In these circumstances, life for people like Makhothatso is very difficult. \n\nMakhothatso has requested a loan from Kiva lenders in order to be able to purchase clean cook stoves, which will provide her and 6 other people from her village, who are living in similar circumstances, the chance of cooking in a way that does not harm them and their families, and that does not require expensive paraffin and gas, or a lot of wood, which is hard to find in Lesotho. This stove can be started with the use of very little readily-available biomass, like dry twigs and dry cow dung, that does not require lengths of time to collect. It does not produce smoke while burning, thus making it safe to be used inside the home. \n\nThis stove comes with a solar panel for charging the battery, which runs the fan in the stove, a USB port for charging phones, and a mini LED lamp. It is a life-improving package for these women. This stove saves them time to be with their family, saves energy, eliminates toxic inhalation, and gives them a better lit home to see in the evening while cooking and enables children to do their homework.

She has high education, but does not want to work in her profession because the salary is very low. She is selling on the market for more than three years. She sells fabrics and her customers are mostly women who are seamstresses. Right now is spring and it's a season for sewing of dresses and other Tajik national clothing. Seamstresses order the fabrics from Shafoat and she brings in what her clients have requested. She choses the fabrics herself because she does not rely on the taste of others. To expand her business and variety of her merchandise she needs a certain amount of money and she has come to MicroInvest for support.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Russian by Elena Fedorchuk, Kiva

Obtaining the loan will help her make more sales, and this way, allow her to make a little more income to provide for her household needs.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Lydia Brantley, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":470565,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Buying produce","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Masaya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.966667 -86.1","type":"point"}},"partner_id":74,"posted_date":"2010-01-15T20:20:18Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":725,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gloria Patricia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-12-18T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":15000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":1056.93},{"due_date":"2010-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":1088.64},{"due_date":"2010-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":1121.3},{"due_date":"2010-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1154.94},{"due_date":"2010-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1189.58},{"due_date":"2010-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1225.27},{"due_date":"2010-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1262.03},{"due_date":"2010-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1299.89},{"due_date":"2010-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1338.89},{"due_date":"2010-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1379.05},{"due_date":"2010-11-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1420.43},{"due_date":"2010-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":1463.05}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.08},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.62},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.2},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.82},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.5},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.22},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.82},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.72},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.65},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.66},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.71}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":172.94,"local_amount":3578.17,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:07:51Z","rounded_local_amount":3610.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118057375},{"amount":59.87,"local_amount":1238.71,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T09:35:58Z","rounded_local_amount":1250.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123892381},{"amount":123.42,"local_amount":2553.47,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T08:39:30Z","rounded_local_amount":2576.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128926032},{"amount":123.16,"local_amount":2548.05,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:02:48Z","rounded_local_amount":2571.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136653587},{"amount":245.61,"local_amount":5081.6,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:01:30Z","rounded_local_amount":5128.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144686261}],"funded_date":"2010-01-16T04:22:29Z","paid_date":"2010-06-15T09:01:30Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lydia Brantley","image":null}},{"id":172996,"name":"Juliet","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Juliet is 40 years of age, married, and has five children aged between six and eighteen years, all of whom go to school.

O. since she is one of the group leaders.  She is 38 years old, married and has three children.  One child is in high school, one in middle school and the youngest is in elementary school.  Tomasa sells bedspreads, tablecloths and sometimes tarps.  She says that the loan she\u2019ll get will be used to buy more bedspreads, sheets, drapes and tablecloths to continue with her business.\r\n\r\nShe decided to go into this line of work because one of her girlfriends recommended it because she said good profits can be made and because she wanted to find a way to help her husband meet household expenses and pay for their children\u2019s education.\r\n\r\nShe is very happy because she says she is doing very well with her business because her sales have increased much.  She now has more customers than she had before thanks to the good service and treatment she provides, aside from the excellent prices.  This is why her income has increased notably.\r\n\r\nTomasa says that she\u2019s never failed to make her repayments on time.  Neither have her fellow members because they are all responsible, punctual women but above all, very hard working.  They have known each other for a long time and this is their 3rd loan with FRAC.  They trust each other and don\u2019t want to disappoint those people that support them and believe in them.\r\n\r\nShe is very grateful to Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad and the donors because without their help she would have not accomplished all she has so far like improving her quality of life and that of her family as well as being able to continue with her business and continue to invest in it.\r\n\r\nTomasa\u2019s goal is to have her business grow and prosper even more than it has to date.  She wants to build a locale to install her linens shop so that she doesn\u2019t have to continue to sell door-to-door.  She also wants to continue to support her children\u2019s education so that they may complete higher education and have a good profession.\r\n\r\nThe group members and their activities are as follows:\r\n\r\nTomasa L.

Little by little in 2008 Donellis worked during carnival season, making hand-painted canvas satchels, accessories for little girls and decorations, and this experience went very well. Then in 2009, a friend recommended that she take part in a flea market at a big commercial center, where she showed off her products and perfected her craft by observing and comparing the competition. Her first loan was for $350 COP, which she used to purchase material, and now she has four people who work for her who are all women who are the head of their households. She pays them for their production during carnival season and at the end of the year, when her sales increase and she needs to hire more staff. Her small workshop is located in her home, where she has a stock of materials and her customers come to choose what they want made. She makes things like headbands and other headwear, purses, cell-phone covers, and lately she has been making surprise birthday presents. Donellis dreams of providing a better financial future for her family, which consists of her parents. She also wants to expand her business with local and national sales points, but that requires expanding her coverage area and she doesn't have the necessary capital to do so. For this reason she is requesting the loan from Kiva, which she plans to use to purchase fabric, buttons, silicone, packaging, advertising and displays, since the end of the year is approaching and she needs to prepare herself to meet her customers' demands."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":608398,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"Purchase fabrics, buttons, packaging, advertising, etc. to prepare for the end of the year.\r\n\r\ncompra de telas, botones, silicona, empaques, publicidad y tambi\u00e9n  exhibidores, pues se acerca la temporada de fin de a\u00f1o y necesita prepararse para responder a sus clientes.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Su credikiva es el primer financiamiento que solicita a la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, con el comprar\u00e1 prendas de plata que tiene encargadas y que auguran una rotaci\u00f3n r\u00e1pida de su merc\u00e1nica y con ello el \u00e9xito de su inversi\u00f3n, porque las solicitudes  vienen de sus clientes rentables.  ","en":"Nicolasa is a very entrepreneurial woman who is well known for her willingness to work and the persistence that she shows in everything she does.  She is the mother of a 16 year-old boy who she dreams of seeing become fulfilled and successful in both his personal and professional life.  This is Nicolasa's greatest motivation.\r\n\r\nAs an entrepreneurial woman, Nicolasa started her business when she was very young, selling products to just a few customers.  However, as a result of her discipline and responsibility, she managed to increase her number of customers.  She sells clothes, footwear, cosmetics, silver jewelry and everything her customers need.  She sells on credit with payment made in instalments that she agrees upon according to each customers' means and needs.\r\n\r\nNicolasa's goal for the future is to acquire some display cases so that she can display her products in an organized fashion as she plans to own a large store in a strategic position that will make it easier for her to reach new customers.  While Nicolasa works hard to achieve her dream, she maintains a profitability of no less than 40% which she plans to further increase by boosting the growth of her working capital, buying for cash in order to obtain good discounts and gaining the loyalty of her best customers through her persistence and through good financial management of her commercial relationships.\r\n\r\nThis Kiva loan is the first loan that Nicolasa has requested from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  She will use it to buy silver jewelry that already she has orders for.  This will ensure a quick turnover of her merchandise which will mean a successful investment because the orders are from her profitable customers.

Jacinta owns and operates a business venture, selling porkbun.  She has two years of experience in this business.  Jacinta needs a loan of WST 1000 to purchase flour, plastic bags, cooking oil, and a frying pan.  She plans to use the profits from her business (estimated to be 200 talas or US $83 per week) to improve and expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2011, Jacinta joined SPBD to gain access to financial services.  Most of SPBD's clients are unable to borrow from commercial banks, because they lack collateral.  This is Jacinta's first loan with SPBD. \r\n\r\n*SPBD evaluates the living conditions of each of its borrowers.  Generally, a loan manager evaluates a variety of social metrics on a scale out of 3 (the higher the number, the better off the person is) and these are averaged for the \"overall social metric score.\"  For example, a 3 out of 3 on \"level of education\" would mean that the borrower has graduated from university.  \r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD: \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem. Please join SPBD's lending team on Kiva to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":934995,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

This leads to poor financial support, hence poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. SELFINA buys and leases equipment to women.

Quitting school due to a lack of money, he turned towards an apprenticeship in maintaining and repairing electronic equipment.  Since finishing his training, he has not been practicing his trade very effectively because he lacked the money to open a shop.  He worked with his friends who were able to open a shop, but he didn't appropriately benefit from it.  Despite all his talent with electronics, Mr. A. continues to lead a difficult life.  <p>To solve the situation, he is requesting a loan to open his shop.  The loan will enable him to rent a place and to acquire work supplies.  Realizing this project will launch this energetic and dedicated young man's business.

Supplies are gotten from rural producers (for the rice) and from wholesale merchants locally and from fair vendors from Sikasso (for the condiments).  Sales are made at the retail level, cash or credit accepted, at the house and the San marketplace.  The customers are composed of retailers and women. \r\n<p>\r\nThey each hope to realize an average profit of 300,000 francs CFA in the course of this cycle.  The profits will be used to pay the loan interest, to provide for the extended family, and to invest the rest in business.

She is 54 years old. Lucena is married and has 3 adult children. To make a living, Lucena owns & operates a foodstall in the market. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from selling a variety of different products like salt, vegetables, coffee, sugar,  etc. in the local community. Lucena is just starting this business.\n\nIn 2005, Lucena joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Lucena has successfully repaid a previous loan of 15,000 Philippine Pesos (about US $319) from GDMPC. Lucena is requesting a new loan of 15000 PHP which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This loan will be the sixth loan taken out by Lucena from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \n\nAbout GDMPC:\n\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.\n\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Ignacia M. S. (in the red blouse) is 44 years old and returned to school where she finished her training as a technical nurse.  She also has a vending stall where she sells products grown by her family.  Do\u00f1a Ignacia is in a common law marriage with Sr. Juan Miguel Mart\u00ednez, who also sells fruits and vegetables.  They have 3 children, two in elementary school and the other in high school.  She lives at Avenue 4 Lot 35 in the Moctezuma settlement of the city of Orizaba VeraC..  Do\u00f1a Ignacia tells us that her community is peaceful and well managed, and that most of the residents have their own businesses.  It is one of the oldest settlements in the city of Orizaba and has a rich tradition as well as a great atmosphere that prevails throughout the community.  \r\n<p>\r\nDo\u00f1a Ignacia learned about Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad through friends and was encouraged to organize a group, which was named \u201cEstrella\u201d (Star).  She saw this was a great opportunity to grow her business because she wanted to add groceries to the products she offers.  She will use her loan to buy fruit (apples, bananas, pears, and oranges), vegetables (tomatoes, peppers, onions, potatoes, carrots, and lettuce), and groceries (oil, rice, paper, soap, and mayonnaise).  \r\n<p>\r\nThe \u201cEstrella\u201d Group is composed of 10 women who have been friends for a long time and meet on the weekends.  They are requesting a loan so that they can improve the quality of life for themselves and their families.  Most of them sell products by catalog, but others sell clothing, snacks, and natural yogurt.\r\n<p>\r\nDo\u00f1a Ignacia is very pleased with her loan because she will be able to offer a variety of fruits, vegetables and groceries and give her customers more choices.  She will be able to get better returns which will enable her to repay her loan and improve the quality of life for her children.\r\n<p>\r\nThe dream of Do\u00f1a Ignacia is to provide for her children so that they can finish their studies.  She hopes to have her own vending location so that she can increase her earnings and expand her business by selling chickens.  She is grateful to Kiva for helping ordinary people who are complete strangers.  The assistance provided to these women help them have their own businesses and improve the quality of life for their families.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva

This can only be done with special machines.  Even though she needs to pay for the sewing, making these items is very profitable.  They contract her to make large amounts of clothing.  That is why Hilda dreams of one day setting up her own business.

The group's members decided to take this name because it is the name of the community where they live and they all originally come from there.  This story is about Mrs Odilia M. R. who is one of the group's members.  She is 48 years old and married.  Her husband is called Emigdio Tacuba.  They have two children; Isela who is 22 and Abel who is 19.  Both of their children are studying.  One is in their second year of a law degree and the other is in the third year of senior high school.  Odilia has a grocery store which she has been running for 10 years.\r\n\r\nOdilia decided on this business because she says there is a lot of demand and it makes good profits.  She also wanted to help her husband a bit with household expenses and the education of their children. She will use her loan to purchase more merchandise for her shop such as rice, beans, milk, sugar, soft drinks, eggs, oil, toilet paper and other products so that it is well stocked.\r\n\r\nOdilia says that her business also benefits her neighbors a lot as there are not many people who have stores near where they live so, as she is the only one who sells there and is close by, they all buy from her.  She offers her customers excellent service and attentiveness as well as reasonable prices.\r\n\r\nOdilia's dream is to extend her house so that she can make her store a little bigger and thereby have a much better stocked store so that she can obtain more and better profits.  This will enable her to continue supporting her children with their higher education so that they can get into very good professions.\r\n\r\nOdilia tells us that the members of her group are very responsible and reliable payers since they have known each other for a long time and they get on very well together.  This is why they have never been late in their payments or missed any payments.  They do not want to let down the company that has shown trust in them.\r\n\r\nOdilia is very thankful to Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad and Kiva for the support of the loan which they are offering.  Thanks to the loan she is able to improve her life and that of her family.\r\n\r\nThe members of 'El Limoncito' and the businesses which they work in are as follows:\r\n\r\nClara B.

He\u2019s been growing cacao for most of his adult life - 30 years. \u201cI like farmers. We have to work otherwise we don\u2019t have anything. It\u2019s hard, but it\u2019s a farmer\u2019s life,\u201d says Felipe. \n\nBeside cacao, Felipe also receives income from corn sold at the Punta Gorda market, one hour down the road from San Jose, as well as beans and yams sold locally. He has used this money to invest in one of few solar panels in the village of San Jose, Toledo District, which is not connected to the grid due to poor road access. The solar panel is hooked to a battery and an inverter to provide electricity for stable phone use and light. What helped Felipe beat his peers in installing electricity in the home? \u201cI never neglect anything,\u201d he says, and lives by it. \n\nFelipe will use the loan to invest in cleaning his cacao plots.

","en":"Mahbubahon's business is selling perfume and cosmetics at the \"Panshanbe\" market.  She rents a store on the second floor of the market, where she sells different brands of products, including Nivea, Dove, Oriflame, Avon and Faberlic.  To order products from these companies, she needs to pay in advance.  For this reason, Mahbubahon is applying for a loan to pay for her most recent order from Oriflame.  Mahbubahon has been an MLF client for two years.  As her business develops and expands in the future, she plans to open her own name-brand store.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Russian by Susie Armitage, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":306739,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to purchase inventory","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Khujand","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"40.28 69.631667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":47,"posted_date":"2009-04-25T01:50:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":275,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mahbubahon","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-04-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2009-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2009-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2009-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2009-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":200}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":55,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2009-05-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T01:15:51Z","rounded_local_amount":212.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44599970},{"amount":55,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2009-06-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-21T07:47:32Z","rounded_local_amount":212.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52994395},{"amount":55,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2009-07-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-06T11:05:35Z","rounded_local_amount":212.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63215660},{"amount":55,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2009-08-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-10T10:28:49Z","rounded_local_amount":212.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73645153},{"amount":55,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2009-09-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-14T09:20:30Z","rounded_local_amount":212.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87084713}],"funded_date":"2009-04-25T12:25:08Z","paid_date":"2009-11-14T09:20:30Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Susie Armitage","image":null}},{"id":107147,"name":"02-\u0110\u00f4ng H\u1ea3i Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Minh N. Th\u1ecb is a 44 year old female living in the town of Thanh Ho\u00e1. Minh is the group leader of a 7 member group loan offered by Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they all are responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.  The official name of this borrowing group is 02 \u0110\u00f4ng H\u1ea3i (16.02.02).\r\n\r\nMinh is married and has 2 school-aged children. To making a living, Minh owns & operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising livestock. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from raising cattle for sale. Minh has been engaged in this business for over 5 years and earns approximately 900.000 VND a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2004, Minh joined Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Minh has successfully repaid a previous loan of 3.079.800 VND from Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women. This previous loan was used to purchase baby livestock to raise & sell in future. She is now requesting a new loan of 6.000.000 VND which will also be used to purchase baby livestock to raise & sell in future. The loan will be the 7th loan taken out by the borrower from Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women.  Minh plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement the family's income.\r\n\r\nAbout the Other Borrowers in the Group:\r\n\r\n1.  L\u00ea Th\u1ecb Oa is a 46 year old female who is requesting a 6.000.000 VND loan to support her business in the agriculture sector raising livestock.\r\n\r\n2.  N.

Th\u1ecb Xu\u00e2n is a 43 year-old female who is requesting a 6.000.000 VND loan to support her business in the agriculture sector raising livestock.\r\n\r\nAbout Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women:\r\n\r\nThe mission of Fund for Thanh Hoa Poor Women (FPW) is to provide sustainable financial services to disadvantaged women in rural areas in the Thanh Hoa province.\r\n\r\nNote: Many FPW borrowers have expressed a desire to borrow larger amounts to make more significant investments in their businesses. In response to this, FPW has recently added a new loan product of 6.000.000 VND with a 20 month term to its Thanh Hoa City branch portfolio. \r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in Vietnamese while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\r\n\r\nMinh N.

She is 42 years old. Eden is married and has one school-aged child. To make a living, Eden owns and operates a specialized retail store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from buying and selling rice in the village. She sells it per sack or even by kilos; sometimes she offers credit payable at the end of the month. Eden has been engaged in her business for more than two years and earns approximately 8,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Eden joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Eden has successfully repaid a previous loan of 11,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional rice to sell. Eden is requesting a new loan of 14,000 PHP (US$300), which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This loan will be the fourth loan Eden has taken out from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement the income of the family. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She got the idea of forming the network after participating in a training session run by Oxfam at Thi\u00e8s, in which she became familiar with group organization and running a business. The members of the group are dedicated to what they do, and meet together once a month. Over and above membership dues, each of them pays 200 FCFA a month into a group operating fund.\r\n\r\nLooking for financing, they decided to join U-IMCEC. The network is divided into 19 subgroups of five people so that financing can be better handled. Each subgroup has its own president and treasurer.\r\n\r\nThey now seek, for the second time, a loan of 100,000 FCFA per member or 500,000 FCFA for each subgroup, to grow their various activities. The members repay their loans to the president and the treasurer, Ms. Coumba Seck. They, in turn, are responsible for repaying U-IMCEC. According to the president, the group\u2019s praiseworthy objective is to fight family poverty.\r\n\r\nThe 5th sub-group (Femmes Commer\u00e7antes N\u00b0 5) consists of:\r\n\u2022\tMs. Yacine S., the president of this sub-group, born in 1962. For the past 17 years she has sold dried fish, palm oil and clothing fabrics in the market. She is married and mother of one child aged 26. As she says, she is active because she needs to combat idleness and handle both her needs and those of her family.

N. will purchase paint, firewood, and soft drinks to improve her business.\r\n\r\nAlejandra F. A. is a member of the group. She is 27 years old and she has a grade 9 education. She lives with her boyfriend, a farmhand, and they have 2 children together: Candido is 8 years old and is in primary school, and Sergio is 2. She has a stand from where she sells corn on the cob, prepared corn, corn drinks, and baked corn cakes. \r\n\r\nWith her loan she wishes to purchase a tricycle to sells her products, a stove and a tank of gas, as well as mayonnaise, and popsicle sticks.  She sells corn on the cob, prepared corn, corn drinks, and corn cakes. \r\n\r\nAlejandra started her business 8 years ago following her aunts retirement from her business. She gave her the cooking tubs and sticks that she had and her mother loaned her some money to purchase corn and she also loaned her a stove.  Alejandra knew how to make corn drinks, prepared corn and corn cakes, as her mother taught her. She sells every day of the week from a wheelbarrow from 5pm to 7:30pm every evening through the streets of Tlayacapan.  She travels through all the streets of her town to sell her products. \r\n\r\nHer business is important because it helps her financially, especially when her husband is out of work and she is still able to buy food. She enjoys preparing the corn for sale and she is very proud because she is well known, especially for her corn cakes and corn drinks. They are very tasty and she always sells out. She tends to more than 50 customers every day. Her business is popular because everyone knows her cooking and they place orders. \r\n\r\nShe faces a challenge when the hot weather approaches and the sales drop. She also finds the competition a challenge. When she first started out she was the only one in the business and today there are many people who sell corn, prepared corn, and corn drinks. \r\n\r\nThe profits from the business will be used to reinvest in business, to pay off some debts, and to repay this loan. Her plan is to find a store from where she can be settled in to sell her product to avoid running the streets. \r\n\r\nTlayacapan is a tourist area that is visited by many travelers who wish to see the old convent and the mummies. They sell terra cotta pottery, and very ornate pots. There is also a very popular musical group named Santa Maria. \r\n\r\nHer business has helped her family when someone falls ill and she was also able to build a house with the help of her husband, who also contributed to the expenses and improvements. Her plans and dream for her children are to provide them with an education. Alejandra is very happy to receive this loan to establish her business as she dreams.  She will be able to give her children a better quality of life.\r\n\r\nThe members of this group wish to convey to Kiva and Fundacion Realidad (Kiva Field Partner) \"Thank you very much and we hope to keep accessing loans while we keep your trust. They are a great help to us in advancing our businesses\".\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2700,"image":{"id":686801,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To purchase a tricycle, a stove, a tank of gas, and ingredients.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Before he received a loan from SMT, Yenku survived by begging in the street of Kabala town and, as one might imagine, life was extremely hard for him and his family.  Through lengthy discussions with SMT staff, SMT recognized that Yenku has strong business skills.

Today, Yenku is off the street and is managing his business in the village.  He sells cotton clothes, cosmetics, etc.  Assisted by his wife, the family has built a small mud house and has a small farm.

With her current loan (her eighth) she plans to buy two types of firewood to split and pack in her compound and to sell.\r\nShe will start repayment three months from the day of disbursement. The success of the business is guaranteed because she is experienced in the business and she has a ready market for dry firewood. Mary plans to use the profit from the business to pay school fees for her children, give good medical attention to her family and also provide balance diet to her family members.\r\nMary is a member in GHAPE, and  she has been taught how to manage the loan from GHAPE. The method of repayment is comfortable.\r\n\r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon.

Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement.  GHAPE instills a sense of family and community within its clients and staff and has developed a strong bond of trust between the organization and its clients.  \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":316455,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fuel\/Firewood","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"buying, transporting, splitting and selling of fire wood","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CM","country":"Cameroon","town":"Foncha St, Nkwen, NW.

With additional income Hasan will be better able to meet his family's financial obligations, especially the education of his children.   \r\n\r\n<P>More about Tajikistan and IMON International<\/P>\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

In light of the country's economic difficulties, K. is seeking to increase his income.
