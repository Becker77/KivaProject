She owns a business venture, planting & harvesting taro for sale.  Sauiluma has 4 years of experience in this business.  Sauiluma needs a loan of WST $1500 to purchase weed-killers such as Gramoxome.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 500 talas or US $208 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Sauiluma joined SPBD.  This is her 2nd loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Sauiluma's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Sauiluma F. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.6 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                         1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:            1.8 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:                2.3 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

Her previous loan of PHP 12,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 8,000, uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 18th loan, she is borrowing PHP 15,000 to buy vegetables and spices to sell at the market to continue to save up for future family needs. Ma. Luz is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work. Help NWTF continue its mission to help the poorest in the Philippines by joining the NWTF Kiva lending team on Kiva.org.\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":690525,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To purchase vegetables and spices to sell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Narra, Palawan","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":145,"posted_date":"2011-01-12T10:40:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ma.

She lives in her own house with her beloved husband, Efra\u00edn, 60, and their three children for whom she wants to provide optimum stability for their future benefit.  When she was young, her parents taught her the meaning of hard work and she helped them plow the fields.  But as she grew up and became independent from her parents, she set up her own business selling beef and she has never regretted it.\r\n\r\nShe usually gets up at 4:00 a.m. to begin her daily task of attending to the livestock and opening her butchery and attending to customers.  She is very happy with her sales business and has been able to educate her children thanks to her income.  She also has bought enough land to take care of all the family.  Since Maura found out about the loans granted through the MFP institution for people wanting to get ahead, she had no doubts about participating and requesting a loan.  This is her second loan through MFP and she is counting on your support.  She is committed to paying back the loan on time because she would like to request future loans.  She plans to use this one to buy two cows for future sale.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":815254,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy cattle.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-07-21T07:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maura ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-06-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":375}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":375,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:30:52Z","rounded_local_amount":1027.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263385407}],"funded_date":"2011-07-21T11:02:33Z","paid_date":"2012-03-15T10:30:52Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sherry Bess","image":833485}},{"id":321864,"name":"Rene Adalid","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rene lives in Choluteca, Honduras where he runs a metalworking shop.

Her only son lives with her in their own house.  Mauricia\u2019s only objective is to get ahead.  She started helping out in her parents\u2019 fields when she was still a little girl.  She\u2019d help them unceasingly and as a young girl would help them sell the products her parents harvested and started earning her first tips.  Today, she has her own field specifically used to grow cocoa beans that she profoundly thanks her parents for the support and knowledge they gave her while still here; she loves to work.\r\n\r\nMauricia rises very early to prepare breakfast and when she finishes her household chores she heads out to her fields with her husband working from very early until nightfall almost every day of the week although on Sundays she occasionally stops working to care for her son who is an invalid.\r\n\r\nShe normally sells her crops to the local gathering center and earns good profits actually to be able to buy basic family staples.

Mukaramakhon's lack of a stable job and the slow productivity of her husband's business as an ecologist did not leave enough money to meet family expenses. For this reason, 10 years ago, Mukaramakhon decided to start her own business, selling fabrics for local cultural dresses. Little by little she made her business grow and by offering her clients a way to pay in installments greatly increased her revenue. Now her business is running smoothly. However, she would like to continue increasing her business so that her situation would be more stable in the future. She is asking for a loan of $ 800 USD that she will pay back in 6 months. With this money, Mukaramakhon will be able to buy seasonal fabrics for the local cultural dresses. The power to help her business grow is in your hands. \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and with it\u2019s famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is 61 years old. Veronica is married and has seven adult children. To make a living, Veronica operates a family member's business venture planting and harvesting rice for sale. Veronica has been engaged in her business for more than 18 years and earns approximately 10000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Veronica joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Veronica has successfully repaid a previous loan of 7000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to to invest in expanding the business. Veronica is requesting a new loan of 14000 PHP, which will be used to purchase fertilizers, such as manure. This will be the second loan taken out by Veronica from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She is 55 years old. Venecia is married and has 2 adult children. To make a living, Venecia owns and operates a business venture in the services sector, providing recycling services. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from hauling away plastics and other recyclables for local businesses and community members. Venecia has been engaged in her business for over 2 years and earns approximately 5,000 PHP a month for these activities.<P>\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Venecia joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Venecia is requesting a loan of 5,000 PHP which will be used to purchase used bottles, plastics and other recyclables to sell. This will be the first loan taken out by Venecia from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement the family's income. <P>\r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:<P>\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three unit offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.<P>\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

business ventures: fishing and fish vending. She lives in Nylon Shell, Canmoros, Binalbagan, Negros Occidental. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2006 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts, by working hard in her businesses.\r\n\r\nConcepcion is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of 7,000 Philippines pesos (PHP). Concepcion is now borrowing 13,000 PHP so that she can purchase fishing gear and equipment. This will be her fourth loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of 10,000 PHP, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Concepcion aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (Dungganon is a Hiligaynon word that means \"honorable\"). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They are indeed \"Dungganon\" -- a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

With the income from her business, Francisca is able to help her husband support the family economically. Francisca is requesting a loan to invest in buying animals and appropriate feed for them. For this reason, she is turning to Edpyme Alternativa and the Kiva lenders for her loan. She is a repeat client of Edpyme, and she made her previous payments in a punctual manner.

She is the women\u2019s representative for the Liberal Democratic Party in Kisumu District, where her principal role is to speak to women, raise awareness, and encourage their involvement in the political process to fight for their rights. As an expert in the art of making traditional baskets, Florence initiated a basket-weaving income-generating project for a group of women within her community five years ago, and she continues to lead and support this group. Her main business and source of income, however, is her community pharmacy which she has managed for the past eight years. \r\n<p>\r\nThanks to her reputation and the location of her pharmacy within the community, her business has flourished.

She lives in Mallco Chap\u00ed in the city of Cochabamba. She works in raw milk production and also in agriculture.\r\n\r\nMrs. Damiana is a single mother - her husband abandoned her with her children when they were young. She had to take responsibility for them for that moment forward. She worked twice as hard to make sure they did not lack anything and that they had a good education and a bright future. Her oldest son is married and already has a child. Mrs. Damiana advises him not to do what his father did. Her other son is finishing university and his mother is very proud that her work has allowed him to finish his studies.\r\n\r\nShe is requesting the loan to buy fodder to feed her cattle and increase her milk production and therefore her income. Every year she buys a truckload of soy.\r\n\r\nMrs. Damiana is a very responsible and hard-working person. Her mother raised her that way. She is thankful for being an only child as she has always been able to count on her parents' support. Her parents are now older but they still live with her. She is an admirable woman and is to be much respected for being a fighter and making her way up. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Kristina Howe, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":459574,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Purchase of fodder for dairy cows","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"Cochabamba","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-17.383333 -66.15","type":"point"}},"partner_id":140,"posted_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:59Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1200,"lender_count":38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Damiana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-12-17T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1200,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":1200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-14T08:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2010-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2010-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2010-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2011-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2011-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2011-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2011-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":150}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":150}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":150,"local_amount":150,"processed_date":"2010-03-14T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T08:40:00Z","rounded_local_amount":150,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128928953},{"amount":150,"local_amount":150,"processed_date":"2010-06-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:36:03Z","rounded_local_amount":150,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151872731},{"amount":150,"local_amount":150,"processed_date":"2010-09-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T09:53:54Z","rounded_local_amount":150,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172093375},{"amount":150,"local_amount":150,"processed_date":"2010-12-14T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T12:46:41Z","rounded_local_amount":150,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188657757},{"amount":150,"local_amount":150,"processed_date":"2011-03-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T10:41:47Z","rounded_local_amount":150,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201262006},{"amount":150,"local_amount":150,"processed_date":"2011-06-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T10:45:40Z","rounded_local_amount":150,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216479190},{"amount":150,"local_amount":150,"processed_date":"2011-09-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T08:38:10Z","rounded_local_amount":150,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232769993},{"amount":150,"local_amount":150,"processed_date":"2011-12-14T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T09:43:05Z","rounded_local_amount":150,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250744455}],"funded_date":"2010-01-02T17:46:34Z","paid_date":"2012-01-15T09:43:05Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":169715,"name":"Boox Xalat Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Boox Xalat  est un groupement de femmes qui regroupe \u00e0 son sein 10 femmes toutes actives dans divers secteurs.

","en":"Boox Xalat is a group of ten women who own businesses operating in various sectors. The group was set up just one year ago and it is chaired by Mrs Ndeye Fatou S., who has been an elementary school teacher for the past eight years. The group members are women of the same neighborhood. They help each other and share a strong feeling of cohesion for the greater good of their \"private kingdom\".\r\n\r\n\"Boox xalat\" is a Wolof expression which means \"sharing a common idea\". The group joined the Thi\u00e8s branch of the microfinance institution U-IMCEC and applies for a loan of 500,000 CFA francs. Each member will receive an identical share of the loan and use it to finance her business or personal family needs.\r\n\r\nThe chairwoman, Mrs Ndeye Fatou S., will use her loan for personal needs. She will invest it in the business of her sister-in-law who cannot take advantage of the institution's financial products due to lack of proper identification documents. Her sister-in-law sells couscous, which is in high demand in her neighborhood. Thanks to the loan, she will be able to purchase millet and ingredients needed to prepare couscous. Mrs Ndeye Fatou S. is highly respected by her peers thanks to her generosity. She is the mother of two children, aged 4 and 2.

She is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP, which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This will be Marife\u2019s first loan from GDMPC.

The main source of income for the business comes from selling both food & daily use products in the local community.

She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand it.\r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She lives in Prk. Nylonshell, Brgy. Canmoros, Binalbagan, Negros Occidental. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2006 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. \r\n\r\nBy working hard in her fishing and food vending businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of 6,000 PHP. Jessebel is now borrowing 13,000 PHP so that she can fund business operations. This will be her fourth loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of 10,000 PHP, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Jessebel aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means 'Honorable'). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams.

While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nConsuelo is married. To make a living, Consuelo owns & operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising livestock. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from raising pigs for fattening and sale. Consuelo has been engaged in her business for over 5 years and earns approximately 4000 PHP every three months.\r\n\r\nIn 2011, Consuelo joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Consuelo is requesting a loan of 6000 PHP, which will be used to purchase livestock feed and other supplies. This loan will be her 1st loan from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 38 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

The members are micro entrepreneurs who sell clothing, assorted merchandise, shoes, crafts and bread.  Some members also have businesses such as a beauty salon or grocery store. The businesses are located mainly in the city of El Seybo, a farming community in the northeast of the country.\r\n\r\nEvangelista makes her home in a simple structure with her husband and their 4 children. She tells us that her most difficult challenge is being sick most of the time due to a chronic illness. Her favorite thing to do is to be at her home. Evangelista has sold bread for about 5 years.  She makes different kinds of bread by herself and sells it. She started the business with her first loan from Esperanza. Evangelista became a Esperanza Internacional client because she wanted to work and go forward with her business.\r\n\r\nEvangelista is very excited about receiving her tenth loan from Esperanza Internacional, having repaid her previous two loans satisfactorily and taking an important step toward her business\u2019s growth.

In addition to milking, she makes cheese molds for selling to people in her area. \r\n\r\nVilma's greatest difficulty is the lack of working capital, which is why she recently closed her grocery store.  But she was invited to participate in her local community bank, where she hopes to achieve her goal of reopening her store and to have better earnings. Vilma belongs to the communal bank, \"Se\u00f1or de Muruhuay,\" and this is her first credit with MFP.  She hopes for all your support to continue with her plans.  She also promises to be punctual with payment of her dues. Upon receiving your support, Vilma will invest the requested loan to buy a bag of peas and corn seed, and several bags of natural fertilizer for her next planting.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":866313,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy a bag of pea seed and bags of fertilizer.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-09-12T19:40:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Vilma ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-08-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":375}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":375,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T10:30:16Z","rounded_local_amount":1023,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276712833}],"funded_date":"2011-09-14T23:51:57Z","paid_date":"2012-05-15T10:30:16Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Angela Yeh","image":827898}},{"id":338301,"name":"Martha","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":" Martha is 47 years old and lives in Paynesville.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Tagda, Hinigaran, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating two business ventures:  General Store and Pig-fattening businesses. Her husband Ely P., who is 42 years old, works as a fisherman to earn his living and also helps in his wife's business activities.  They have 2 children who are 8 and 15 years old. \r\n\r\nRegina joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1998 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 13 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Regina has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 13,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 10,000, uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 14th loan, she is borrowing PHP 15,000, which she intends to use to purchase stock for the general store so that she can continue to save up for future education of her children. \r\n\r\nRegina P. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \t\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed on a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Kyrgyzstan). She is the mother of five children\u2014two sons and three daughters. She is married and lives with her eldest son, daughter-in-law and grandson.\r\n\r\nTursun was born into a simple farm family. Since childhood she helped her mother on the farm and like to do housework.  After leaving school, she started work on the local collective farm as a milkmaid. In 1971, four years after graduating, Tursun married. In the beginning, she and her husband lived with his parents in Sosnovka village (in the Zhaiylsky area of Chuysky, Kyrgyzstan).  Her husband worked on a local collective farm, and Tursun looked after their household. Soon the collective farm where Tursun\u2019s husband worked allocated them a plot of land in order to build a home.  Within three years, Tursun\u2019s husband built a house, and after the birth of their first child (a daughter), they have moved away from his parents. They did not get a farm all at once.  In due course, they acquired a calf and on ground allocated by the state they began to grow clover and barley.  After a time, Tursun found work at a local cotton mill as a weaver, where she has worked more than twenty years.  In due course, the family grew, as did the farm, which was expanded after the sale of some cattle at the market.  In 2008 Tursun purchased a shop in the Bishkek \u2013 Osh road, and started to sell groceries.  She is helped by her younger son and daughter-in-law.\r\n\r\nNow on Tursun\u2019s farm there is one milk cow, one calf, two horses and twelve sheep. Tursun has applied to  Bai-Tushum  and Partners for a loan of 80,000 som (KGS) to increase her livestock.  With her income, she plans to further expand the farm and to open a new shop.\r\n\r\nBai-Tushum and Partners uses Kiva funding to target the especially vulnerable population. Bai-Tushum and Partners is one of the leading Microfinance Institutions in Kyrgyzstan. As a reliable financial partner, Bai-Tushum contributes to the economic development of the Kyrgyz Republic through the delivery of microfinance services in rural and urban areas that lead to increased employment and meet the interests of its clients and investors.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1775,"image":{"id":797206,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase cattle","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Sosnovka village","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2011-06-21T16:40:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1775,"lender_count":60,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Tursun","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-06-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":80000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":1775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":80000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1775}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":1775,"local_amount":80000,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-16T08:14:36Z","rounded_local_amount":80331.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276816085}],"funded_date":"2011-06-22T23:25:02Z","paid_date":"2012-05-16T08:14:36Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Melissa Kniazeva","image":1694640}},{"id":313715,"name":"Akufo\u00e9 Mawusinu","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Veuve de 53 ans et m\u00e8re de cinq enfants, Akufo\u00e9 est revendeuse de trousseau b\u00e9b\u00e9 au march\u00e9 Assiy\u00e9y\u00e9  d\u2019Adidogom\u00e9 depuis 2001.elle s\u2019approvisionne \u00e0 Lom\u00e9.

According to her, for harvest, she and her husband hire farm workers to help them pick their crops faster. \"I like that,\" she affirms.

Very clever and active, she remains one of the working women in the village of Ahonkp\u00e9 where she lives with her orphans. Her main activity is to purchase cassave and process it into flour (cassava flour), one of the basic foods in south Togo. Madam N. has shown proved to be an honest and trustworthy woman through the repayments without incidents of her first two credits granted.\r\n\r\nThe flour production is a very hard activity with many risks of injury due to a lack of suitable tools.  Buying a tool, the rough, with a credit of $750 will provide an important opportunity to increase her production and income. The rough could even be rented to other women in the area.  This will provide to them significant income. Having the rough avoids making a 3 to 5 km trek to have the cassava rasped. The remainder of the credit will serve to buy cassava in other farms to have sufficient raw materials for the regular production all over the year.\r\n\r\n<p> \r\nAg\u00e9e de 35 ans environ, elle est veuve et m\u00e8re de trois (03) enfants.

C. belongs to a village bank called \u201cSumaqcha,\u201d which is Quechua (native language) for \u201cBeautiful Bank.\u201d<p>Anita is a business woman. She sells a variety of different products to a variety of different clients, enabling her to capitalize on several markets. Anita sells clothing, ice cream, cigarettes, and coca leaves. Coca leaves are a very important part of Andean culture here in Ayacucho, Peru. They are used to make a tea or simply chewed and are known for their many medicinal benefits including alleviation of hunger, facilitation of metabolism, and help with altitude sickness. In addition to all of this, Anita also sells fresh fish by the box once every month to individual customers and restaurants. <p>For ten years, Anita has been running her own business, but the truth is that her experience goes back much, much further. Her mother also sold coca leaves, as well as fruit, in the local markets, and Anita grew up watching and learning. Just as she helped her mother, today Anita\u2019s four children also help her in the markets. One daughter is in charge of selling clothes, another is in charge of ice cream, and the other two help where they can. However, because Anita insists that school comes before anything else, they are only allowed to help on Saturdays and Sundays. <p>Everything Anita does, she does for her children\u2019s future. When her husband left the five of them some years ago, Anita had no choice but to work twice as hard to provide for her family as a newly single mother. Her goal is to see all four of her children through to professional degrees. As a means to accomplish this, Anita\u2019s professional goal is to open up her own small grocery store.

She is a traveling salesperson. She has had her business for the past nine years. She decided to start her business because she needed to find a way to provide for her family.  She began by selling all types of clothing, but she didn't have the funds to buy enough items to sell, so she started by selling a few clothing items like underwear, jeans, and shirts for teens. She started selling to her neighbors and friends, but then moved on to markets where she was able to find more costumers. Everyday she works hard to obtain more merchandise to sell because she liked making a living this way.  Now she wants to increase her inventory of merchandise even more because her clothing is in high demand. She wants this loan to be able to buy cosmetics, children's clothes, shirts for teens, men's jeans and other products that she can sell.  She will travel to Managua where she can purchase the items at the lowest cost.

He is going to use this loan to buy more high quality cacao seed and fertilizer. \r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Indonesian by Antonius Gunadi, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":278477,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"buy cacao seeds and fertilizer","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Melaya, Bali","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":82,"posted_date":"2009-03-02T21:40:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"I Komang Wistra","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-02-11T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"IDR","disbursal_amount":4000000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":4000000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":350}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":350,"local_amount":4000000,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:38:53Z","rounded_local_amount":4128061.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123947438}],"funded_date":"2009-03-03T01:12:39Z","paid_date":"2010-03-15T10:38:53Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Antonius Gunadi","image":null}},{"id":95719,"name":"Amelia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Amelia S. is married to Romeo S..

In the business they manage, the couple earn a net income of only 400 pesos weekly (roughly $US8) because they pay hired workers in the shop who help in making furniture for sale. The couple plans to improve their business in order to increase their income and also to help other unemployed workers out with educational attainment to support their families, too. However, the couple lacks the needed capital. \r\n<p>\r\nLearning about ASKI, the micro-finance institution providing the loan, Amelia came to realize that their plans are possible.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Ella solicita este financiamiento para comprar cremas, colonias, ropa, calzado y cosm\u00e9ticos. Su mayor sue\u00f1o es obtener un lugar en donde pueda ofrecer sus productos.","en":"Aurelia Francisca Garc\u00eda sells general merchandise.

Every day she needs to get up very early to prepare the things she offers her customers.  \r\n\r\nShe is asking for this loan to buy creams, colognes, clothes, footwear, and cosmetics.  \r\n\r\nHer

She owns a business venture, selling fine mats used as keepsakes .  Marata has 3 years of experience in this business.  Marata needs a loan of WST $1500 to buy laufala (plant fibres) and decorations for mats.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 450 talas or US $188 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Marata joined SPBD.    This is her 3rd loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Marata's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Marata L. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                         1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:            1.5 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:                2.5 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

She earns her living by operating two business ventures: a piggery and a food-vending business. Her husband, Miguel A., who is 40 years old, works as a farmer and also helps in his wife's business activities. They have six children who are between 4 months and 17 years old.\r\n\r\nMaribeth joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2007 because she wished for something better for her family. With the help of her past five loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, she has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 11,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 14,000, uplifting her family's standard of living.\r\n\r\nThis time, for her 6th loan, Maribeth is borrowing PHP 13,500, which she intends to use to purchase feeds and vitamins for her pigs so that she can continue to save for the future education of her children and to put up a general store.\r\n\r\nMaribeth is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>About NWTF:<\/b>\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress out of earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.\r\n\r\nHelp NWTF continue in its mission to help the poorest in the Philippines by visiting the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.kiva.org\/team\/nwtf_philippines\" target=\"_blank\">NWTF lending team<\/a>

P. is 36 years old, married, and supports her family by operating one business venture: a pottery business.  She lives in Sitio Tuburan, Brgy. Camba-og, Hinigaran, Negros Occidental. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 1999 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. \r\n\r\nBy working hard in her pottery business, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 8,000. Grace is now borrowing PHP 14,000 so that she can continue to fund the operations of her business. This will be her 16th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 14,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Grace aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

She is very happy about it and shows a lot of dedication. She never missed class, and she always looks forward to Saturdays, which are the days on which the course takes place. She put into practice everything she learned, and she is awed at all the human body can do and feel, and at how neatly everything works.

Ameyo is the only caretaker for seven children out of the thirteen her husband has with his polygamous wives, and whose husband is currently unemployed as well. The main source of income for the family is the sales of manioc(cassava root) flour, and a source of income with too much instability to assure the education of the children. Mrs Ameyo's work, preparing the manioc paste is very difficult. It is because of this that she is asking for a loan of $1,000.00 in order to buy a rough mill that will be able to be used by other women in her area as well. The loan will also be used to buy some manioc fields from the farmers, who have large fields. She proposes repaying the loan in 12 months. The loan will have a positive impact in her economic activities but above all, the improvement of living conditions for her family.<p>Translated from French by Kiva Volunteer, Kristin Connor<p>\r\n\r\n\r\nAg\u00e9e de 45 ans ; Madame S.

It is a common misconception that only people with low incomes take the Trotro. Schoolchildren, workers and everyone takes it because it is affordable, as compared to a taxi. But many people also believe that it is better. Wilson says he has had a recent breakdown which is keeping him from making sufficient income to run the business. He requests a loan to buy vehicle parts to mend his car. With the loan he also believes he can make more profits so that within two years he can buy additional cars.

The salary of her husband is not enough to cover their daily expenses, so she decided to start a Sari\u2013sari Store to earn extra income to support their family\u2019s needs. Eight years ago, around 2001, she was able to start a small sari-sari store at their home with a starting capital of only PHP 3,000 borrowed from Paglaum MPC. Now, she is applying for a loan worth PHP 20,000. With this amount she can buy more grocery items.

She is married and the mother of two children (19 and 13 years old), one who is the youngest student at one of the official schools in Boane.  Helena studied through seventh grade because she lost her parents very early.  A native of the city Maputo, she has lived in Boane for more than 20 years with her husband.  They live in their own home.<P>\r\n\r\nShe learned how to run a business during five years of unemployment, having to learn this with her older sibling who also learned by experience.  Her specialty is selling sodas, and she makes a monthly income of 300 MT (<em>meticais<\/em>).  This is Elena's second loan with Hluvuku (Kiva's Field Partner) and her first with Kiva.  She will use it to buy a variety of products.  This is not her first experience with a lending institution; she was a client of two small banks that work in the district.

Manuel is a laborer while Cecilia sells food in their neighborhood. The couple has six children to raise and to work hard for.\r\n\r\nTheir eldest daughter, Mipa, (26 years old) was sent to college. However she chose not to continue with her studies because she knew that her parents have to send her five other siblings to school also and it will be very hard for them to cope with their financial needs. Mipa therefore, worked as a housemaid to at least augment their family income. Cecilia and her husband's income was not stable then, so that even their second child's education in high school was suspended. \r\n\r\nIn 2005, Cecilia joined a group of women in ASHI to avail themselves with the opportunity of getting a loan. Her decision was supported by her husband, since they both need a more stable source of income, which means they need to have their own business. Previous loans Cecilia obtained have been very helpful to her and her family. They were able to start up their rice farming business and were able to send their five children to school. Presently, their second child and the third child are in high school, the fourth child is in elementary and two are preschoolers. \r\n\r\nCecilia's farming business has grown so well that it requires a bigger amount of capital for sustainability. She needs to obtain a bigger loan from ASHI in order to purchase all the necessary farm inputs such as rice seed, fertilizer, and pesticides. Also she needs to spend money on the land preparation and labor charges.\r\n\r\nWith this business, Cecilia has greater hopes and dreams for herself, her family, and her children. Being the owner and business manager, she believes that in the future her personality will be developed and she will become more sociable. Most importantly, all of her children will graduate from college and she will have more rice field to manage with the help of her husband so that they will harvest more rice and can supply the demands of their consumers.\r\n\r\nDespite having a farming business, Cecilia did not let go of her food selling business. The food she sells offers convenience to farmers during planting season. During this time, she can have a big income.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":346490,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To

Said has worked in agriculture since he was young. He works even harder at it now because he has made his home with his wife and their four lovely children, whom he loves very much. Due to his high level of knowledge, Said takes full advantage of his parcels of land and also leaves them fallow sometimes so that the land will grow excellent products for him. It is for this reason that he is requesting a loan of $1000 to invest in seeds and mineral fertilizer for his crops (wheat and potatoes) and to take good care of his land. Said feels this is the only way to earn enough to ensure that his children can stay in school and have a bright future. Support this man of much strength and courage to keep working.  \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

There are not any factories or huge companies. However, the citizens are laborious and ambitious. Burul J., a leader of this group, is a great example to be followed. Burul is delicate woman but has really unimaginable will and strength because she went through a hard trial. Unfortunately, a few years ago her husband died. \r\n\r\nAfter the death of her husband, life seemed already cracked, and she lost heart, but the future of her daughter really forced her to go ahead. Now, Burul has a daughter who is 16. Her daughter attends a local school in Balykchy. About five years ago, she got a loan of 7,000 Kyrgyzstani som (about $156) and she opened up her business, which is located just inside the house. Since then her life became normal. Now she sells foodstuffs such as macaroni, rice, sugar, salt, oil, fizzy drinks and detergent. \r\n\r\nAt present, her net income is about 5,000 KGS (about $110). She wants to get a loan to increase the stock of foodstuffs prior to a holiday season in order to make enough earnings to buy a trade pavilion in the future. Her future plan is to give an education to her daughter, to whom she dedicated her life, and buy and place her own pavilion in her yard.\r\n\r\nNazgul K. is 38. She is married and has four children, two sons and two daughters. Her husband works as a driver in the administration of reservoir. She works as a security officer in the administration of reservoir. At present, they are increasing the number of their cattle. Their revenue is 4,000 KGS (about $90). They want to get a loan to buy young plants of apricots and apples to plant in the field. \r\n\r\nArdakbek K. is 42. He is married and has four children; two of them are sons and two are daughters. His wife is a housewife. He works as a clerk in the city hall. He inherited 20 sheep and, little by little, increased the number of sheep. Now he is just fattening them. He wants to get a loan to buy another sheep and sell them all in the future.\r\n\r\nSalima A. is 24. She has two children and a brilliant husband who works as radio operator at the station. Now they are reselling cattle. At first, they bought five of them and after fattening them, they resold them. Their revenue is 4,000 KGS (about $90). They want to get a loan to buy horses.\r\n\r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance, a young and ambitious socially-focused MFI in Kyrgyzstan.

It is characterized by the great joy of its people and the spirit of solidarity that they demonstrated when they succeeded in supporting local government for the paving of their streets, through resources obtained from walks, bingo, raffles, festivals and other community activities. It is in this environment where Merlyn has developed her business, which started when working in a company. She used to help her cousin to win customers in order to sell them his goods, and there she saw the possibility of an additional income and started the same business selling to friends, neighbors and grew her customer base offering goods to all that came near; her cousin continued to supply her until she saved the $150,000 that allowed her to negotiate directly with department stores and local stores, as up until now she did it through a healthy business connection. Now her great challenge is to complete a sustainable business expansion and in the future her dream is to have a local store where she can integrate all her businesses and her main goal is to offer Yosimar,  her son, the highest quality education and always be his emotional support.       \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Catherine Dent, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":523097,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To buy women's clothing and footwear for men and women.

Charita has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional products to sell. Charita is requesting a new loan of 8,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional inventory & working capital. This loan will be the second loan taken out by Charita from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to further expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, we created this template for our field staff to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":577358,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To purchase additional inventory & working capital","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Naawan, Misamis Oriental","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":128,"posted_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:31Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":200,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Charita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":8000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":400},{"due_date":"2010-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":400},{"due_date":"2010-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":400},{"due_date":"2010-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":400},{"due_date":"2010-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":400},{"due_date":"2010-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":400},{"due_date":"2010-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":400},{"due_date":"2010-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":400},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":400},{"due_date":"2010-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":400},{"due_date":"2010-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":400},{"due_date":"2010-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":400},{"due_date":"2010-09-29T07:00:00Z","amount":400},{"due_date":"2010-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":400},{"due_date":"2010-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":400},{"due_date":"2010-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":400},{"due_date":"2010-10-27T07:00:00Z","amount":400},{"due_date":"2010-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":400},{"due_date":"2010-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":400},{"due_date":"2010-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":400}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":10},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":10},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":10},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":10},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":10},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":10},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":10}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":80,"local_amount":3200,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:23:41Z","rounded_local_amount":3644.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166858759},{"amount":50,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:13:33Z","rounded_local_amount":2277.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172124987},{"amount":40,"local_amount":1600,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T14:33:28Z","rounded_local_amount":1822.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177418782},{"amount":30,"local_amount":1200,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T14:22:56Z","rounded_local_amount":1366.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182557861}],"funded_date":"2010-08-03T13:23:12Z","paid_date":"2010-12-15T14:22:56Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Trupti  Kamath","image":null}},{"id":223591,"name":"Dora","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"  Dora L.

She is married and has three children between the ages of 10 and 32. She runs a business out of her home preparing and selling fast food, such as hot dogs, sandwiches, kebabs and french fries, that she makes with the most delicious seasonings and sauces. She started a business 10 years ago with a shop in another neighborhood in Soledad. She used her first loan from Kiva partner Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo to strengthen her business and further prospered with three more loans, but during her fourth loan she lost her son to an illness and she closed the business and moved to her home. Five years later, she started her business selling french fries and later when a neighbor showed her the techniques to prepare other fast foods she started her current business in place of the old one. Selling the different kinds of fast foods, her business gradually grew and Dora took advantage of her sales points very well. First, she rented a hot dog cart for 60,000 pesos a month, and later on she purchased a cart for 1.2 million Colombian pesos. She gradually kept adding other equipment to expand her infrastructure, first a heater, then chairs and finally a microwave oven. Currently she wants to expand the range of products she offers and add others like ice cream, pastries and beverages, and that is why she is turning to Kiva. She plans to make her first order of ice cream and purchase the sauces, seasonings and flour necessary to make her products. Her goal is to keep her business prospering by diversifying her products and adding other familiar staples so she can emulate the success of the shop she once had.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from
