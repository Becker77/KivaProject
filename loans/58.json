She is married with 2 children.  Carmen began as a manufacturing employee and worked for many years but had to resign, due to her child's long-term health problems which impeded her from complying with work hours.\r\n\r\nSince that time, she has looked for opportunities to work independently, for a way to generate income that will permit her to care for her son.  This is how she came to make dresses for a long time, which wore her out.  For this reason, and knowing how to handle customers, she decided to become a merchant.  For the last 7 years she has sold products, using specialized guides to products, in order to continue to add to the family income, in union with her husband.  He is also a merchant, selling disposable products and operating a pharmacy.\r\n\r\nHer small beginning capital was fortified from the start by the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation, with more than 6 loans, each gradually increasing as the last was paid off.  She believed that each loan should be administered cautiously, that is, directing them towards investing in merchandise to reproduce her working capital, which she has been doing all this time.  She is very satisfied with the loans she has received; her monthly payments have been negotiated by the assessor during the first visit at payable amounts and desirable periods that would benefit her family.\r\n\r\nPresently, she is applying for a loan of $2,000,000 (Colombian pesos) to be used to obtain discounts in paying off previous invoices early, and to buy merchandise requested by her customers.  Her principle goals are related to changing neighborhoods; buying a house in a more central zone where  she will be close to her principle customers, who are employees and independent workers.  She is very selective in granting small amounts of credit, with an initial quota set when each begins as a customer.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Harold Sims, Kiva

She is 53 years old, married and has 5 adult-aged children. To make a living, Cristina owns and operates a specialized retail store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from selling coconut shell charcoal in the local community. Cristina has been engaged in her business for over 5 years and earns approximately 9,000 PHP per month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Cristina joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. Cristina has successfully repaid a previous loan of 8,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to purchase more coconut shells and working capital. Cristina is requesting a new loan of 8,000 PHP which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This loan will be the 3rd loan taken out by Cristina from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement her family's income. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Jowelia has been operating a produce-sales business from Ihuriro cell, Ntungamo, for a period of nine years. Looking back, this happily married mother of six children recalls how her business flourished at the start.\r\n\r\nTimes have changed, however, as the business now is showing diminishing returns due to hard financial times. Jowelia now makes 120,000 Ugandan shillings in a month. This is in contrast to what she was making at the beginning.\r\n\r\nThere is always a story associated with people in western Uganda who, despite laboring under such tough times, find a way of educating their children. Jowelia is no exception to this. She has not given up despite this and it\u2019s partly the reason why she is still in business.\r\n\r\nWhat Jowelia is looking forward to now is the prospect of enhancing her business by buying more maize, beans, rice, millet, cassava and other crops with the assistance of this loan.

As a divorced woman raising three children, having her own business has given her the income and flexibility she needed to be be sole bread-winner and care-giver for her family.\r\n\r\nThrough FMSD's collaboration, Gregoria Maria has had the honor of participating in numerous design fairs and other special events including Colombia Tex in Medellin, Ni\u00f1a World International competition in Colombia, and in other beauty and talent contests where her designs have adorned prize winning candidates. Gregoria also won FMSD's prize for excellence in 2004, being named Woman Entrepreneur of the Year. \r\n\r\nThrough FMSD Gregoria Maria also participated in a mission to Europe where she attended training sessions to learn new design techniques and meet other Colombians involved in the textiles industry. Those connections have paid dividends, leading to some recent contracts with some of the nicest hotels in Barranquilla to make table cloths and upholster chairs as well uniforms for employees at special events.\r\n\r\nThrough her efforts, Gregoria has greatly improved her family's quality of life. She's a woman who doesn't rest easily.  In addition to her business, she works several nights a week as a guard at a local school (soon she'll be able to retire and collect a pension).  \r\n\r\nShe wants to continue generating employment opportunities for others through her business, and for that reason she has acquired 12 sewing machines and also subcontracted to others when she receives large contracts. \r\n\r\nHer greatest dream is to start exporting her work to other countries, though the barriers and start up costs are great.  Gregoria Maria would especially like to send her work to Europe.  Her personal philosophy is to not be bothered by problems and complications, because she knows she can overcome anything.  From time to time she's had to confront clients as well as sub-contractors who didn't deliver, but she's always risen above.\r\n\r\nGregoria Maria is a positive woman who is working hard to grow her business, a business that has enabled her to put two children through college,  buy her own home, get a car, and employ several women.  She's asked for this loan from Kiva through FMSD to help pay for her youngest son's university studies. \r\n\r\n\r\n[EN ESPANOL]\r\n\r\nGregoria C\u00e1rdenas, propietaria de \u201cMarina Confecciones C\u00e1rdenas\u201d tiene este negocio, desde que decidi\u00f3 mejorar su calidad de vida hace ya 30 a\u00f1os, cuando sola con la responsabilidad de sus 3 hijos, emprendi\u00f3 la hoy microempresa dedicada a fabricar prendas de vestir en todas las  l\u00edneas  conocidas, porque conoce muy bien su arte y gradualmente lo ha perfeccionada con el tiempo y de la mano de la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, quien la ha impulsado aprovechando su gran potencial de crecimiento como persona, como mujer y como empresaria. Gracias a este apoyo ha participado en ferias importantes de la confecci\u00f3n, como en Colombia Tex en Medell\u00edn, en el certamen ni\u00f1a Word de Colombia, y en jornadas de belleza y talento donde ha ganado premios. Gregoria cuenta, como al mismo tiempo que la Fundaci\u00f3n gan\u00f3 el premio a la excelencia, ella en ese mismo a\u00f1o tambi\u00e9n le otorgaron el premio a la mujer empresaria del a\u00f1o 2004 y tambi\u00e9n como, a trav\u00e9s de esta organizaci\u00f3n participo  en la Misi\u00f3n a Europa, donde mediante jornadas formativas aprendi\u00f3 nuevas t\u00e9cnicas y la actualizaci\u00f3n de dise\u00f1os y consigui\u00f3 muchas amistades del mismo sector de la confecci\u00f3n en Colombia, lo que  la ha  llevado a obtener contratos en los hoteles mas importantes de Barranquilla, a quienes hoy en d\u00eda les confecciona los manteles, viste tambi\u00e9n las sillas de las mesas y eventos importantes y fabrica la ropa de sus empleados. \r\nGregoria Marina con grandes esfuerzos de trabajo ha sacado a su familia adelante,  porque es una mujer que no se queda quieta, pues as\u00ed como tiene su negocio de confecciones, tambi\u00e9n trabaja en la noche en un colegio como secretaria,  donde est\u00e1 pr\u00f3xima a recibir su pensi\u00f3n por jubilaci\u00f3n.  Su deseo siempre es generar empleo por eso adem\u00e1s de poner a funcionar sus 12 maquinas de confecci\u00f3n, tambi\u00e9n trabaja mediante talleres sat\u00e9lites cuando consigue los buenos contratos de los que siempre esta en su b\u00fasqueda. Ahora sue\u00f1a con exportar, pero le parecen muy dispendioso los requisitos y costos para hacerlo le gustar\u00eda que fuera a Europa  porque ganar\u00eda en euros,  En su filosof\u00eda no  plantea  el termino problemas, porque siempre logra lo que quiere, pero cree que lo mas dif\u00edcil es  cuando los clientes no pagan a tiempo y ella necesita responder a sus operarias y a la producci\u00f3n. De todas maneras es una mujer feliz porque sus hijos son profesionales y el \u00faltimo est\u00e1 en la universidad, siendo justamente la solicitud  de cr\u00e9dito que hace a la Fundaci\u00f3n para pagarle su semestre. Gregoria Marina se manifiesta como una mujer prospera y exitosa, que con su esfuerzo   tiene una casa que ha adecuado como ha querido, un carro nuevo para transportarse, un importante taller de confecci\u00f3n  que produce y genera empleo  y una maravillosa familia que tambi\u00e9n avanza con pasos firmes."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":560274,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"Pay for son's university studies.

This Kiva borrower is receiving a new ELA loan. The ELA program first provides disadvantaged adolescents, usually girls who are out of school, with livelihood training and financial literacy skills.  Afterward, ELA participants can receive microfinance loans to expand their small businesses.  These loans offer adolescents a unique chance to access finance at a young age and improve their prospects for the future, and target a segment of the population not typically served by traditional microfinance. Kiva is privileged to partner with BRAC Uganda in posting these new loans, and give Kiva lenders the opportunity to fund deserving young entrepreneurs and support a promising new sector in microfinance.\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":100,"image":{"id":593825,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Charcoal

They decided to give it this name because they meet in a small cabin at the group representative\u2019s house.  This story is about Ms. Natividad G. G., since she is the representative of the group.\r\n\r\nShe is 37 years old, married to Porfirio, with whom she has 2 children: Jos\u00e9 Alberto and Karen Arlet.  Both children are in primary school, one in sixth grade and the other in fourth grade.  She has had a grocery store for 4 years.\r\n\r\nShe chose this activity because she had to find a way to help her husband with the household expenses and their children\u2019s education.  She also wanted to improve their standard of living and, the fact that the business is a good income producer, is the reason she decided on this type of enterprise.  \r\n\r\nShe plans to use the loan she received to continue investing in her store.  She would like to purchase additional merchandise such as: salt, sugar, rice, beans, soups, beverages, waters, juices, eggs, oil, soap, toilet paper, candles, and many other products that she\u2019s missing, in order to have a good variety of merchandise and a well-supplied store.\r\n\r\nHer business is serving her well, as her earnings allow her to support her children in their studies as well as to improve their quality of life.  In addition, she is saving to buy a computer for her children so they can use it to do their homework. \r\n\r\nNati states that her goal is to expand her business, and she would like to build a larger locale in order to grow much more and convert it into a store that is well-stocked and generates more income for her.  She is also thinking about installing a pharmacy, as there are none in her community.\r\n\r\nShe states that she knows her associates very well, and comments that they are very responsible, hard-working and trustworthy people who have a great desire to get ahead and succeed.  Likewise, at no point have they defaulted or been late with their loan payments.\r\n\r\nShe gives thanks to the lenders on Kiva, for giving her this opportunity and their trust but most of all, for believing in her.  Thanks to their help, she can invest in her business and look forward to a brighter future.  \r\n\r\nThe members of the group and the activities they carry out are:\r\n\r\nIsabel L.

This will be her 16th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 29500, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom.

Five years ago, this entrepreneurial woman installed a grocery store in part of her house.  She says she started this business since her husband did not want her to neglect the children. Since then it has gone very well for her, since where she lives there is no competition nearby, and her neighbors buy her products all day long, since she is open from 9am to 9pm.  At the same time, she also sells beauty products from a well-known brand.  She put a small display case in her store where she offers her products to her customers, and sometimes when they ask her for a product, she gives it to them on credit.  Since she is an entrepreneurial woman, for the future she plans to expand her business even more, since she wants to increase her earnings.  This is her first loan with MFP, and she promises to pay on schedule, since she does not want the people who made possible the money that will allow her to continue working in search of progress to think badly of her.  Teobalda plans to use the loan to purchase a display case so her customers can see the variety of her products. She also wants to buy some merchandise to better supply her store."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":729877,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy a display case","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-03-14T00:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Teobalda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-03-10T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2011-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2011-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2011-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2011-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2011-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":165}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.63},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.62},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.63},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.62},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.63},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":62.63,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:33:05Z","rounded_local_amount":173.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206196374},{"amount":62.62,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:41:15Z","rounded_local_amount":173.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211270055},{"amount":59.49,"local_amount":158.65,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:33:39Z","rounded_local_amount":164.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216550072},{"amount":65.76,"local_amount":175.35,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T09:12:55Z","rounded_local_amount":182.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221718748},{"amount":62.63,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-17T08:13:10Z","rounded_local_amount":173.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227350202},{"amount":61.87,"local_amount":165,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:48:29Z","rounded_local_amount":171.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232850690}],"funded_date":"2011-03-16T00:36:07Z","paid_date":"2011-10-15T09:48:29Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Karen Ohrenberger","image":null}},{"id":285472,"name":"Batrentsen","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Batrentsen, 34, is married and lives with his wife and two children in Arhangai province, Mongolia.

Meanwhile, Andry continues to work constantly to acquire beauty products in larger volumes to increase turnover, although her working capital is insufficient for now.  For this reason she applied for a loan through the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation.  She plans to use part of the money to buy larger volumes of products for the huge discounts.  She'll use the rest of the loan to make improvements in her salon.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":850,"image":{"id":758425,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty Salon","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"To buy a larger volume of beauty products","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2011-04-28T08:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":850,"lender_count":27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Andry Paola","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-04-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":102781},{"due_date":"2011-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":114334},{"due_date":"2011-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":116525},{"due_date":"2011-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":118759},{"due_date":"2011-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":121035},{"due_date":"2011-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":123355},{"due_date":"2011-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":125719},{"due_date":"2012-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":128129},{"due_date":"2012-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":130585},{"due_date":"2012-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":133087},{"due_date":"2012-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":135638},{"due_date":"2012-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":150053}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.24},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.79},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.03},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.3},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.59},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":69.9},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71.24},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.6},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.42},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.86},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.03}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":58.24,"local_amount":102781,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:09:31Z","rounded_local_amount":103671.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216509441},{"amount":64.79,"local_amount":114334,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:49:23Z","rounded_local_amount":115324.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221673663},{"amount":66.03,"local_amount":116525,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-17T08:00:56Z","rounded_local_amount":117534.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227320223},{"amount":67.3,"local_amount":118759,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:06:15Z","rounded_local_amount":119788.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232803356},{"amount":68.59,"local_amount":121035,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-18T08:57:30Z","rounded_local_amount":122083.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244568401},{"amount":69.9,"local_amount":123355,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:07:50Z","rounded_local_amount":124424.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250779742},{"amount":71.24,"local_amount":125719,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T10:21:05Z","rounded_local_amount":126808.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257188159},{"amount":72.61,"local_amount":128129,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:43:17Z","rounded_local_amount":129239.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276650651},{"amount":311.3,"local_amount":549363,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:11:21Z","rounded_local_amount":554124.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287101236}],"funded_date":"2011-05-01T04:27:29Z","paid_date":"2012-07-15T09:11:21Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sherry Bess","image":833485}},{"id":297765,"name":"Javier Antonio","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"el joven Javier E. tiene 23 a\u00f1os de edad, vive en el barrio el Estruendo de la ciudad de Choluteca y tiene un taller de carpinteria, Javier distribuye sus productos en diferentes casa comerciales de la ciudad de\nCholuteca, asi tambien a muchas personas particulares, tiene muchos clientes ya que los dise\u00f1os y acabados son de muy buena calidad.

Despite these constraints, Armando maintains a sunny outlook on life, which makes him very popular in the neighborhood of Ginandiana where he lives and works. Armando also has dreams for his business: he says that he hopes to expand his workshop over time, and he aspires to someday be a great businessman.\r\n\r\nThis is Armando's first loan from Kiva and Esperanza International, and he intends to invest the loan in his business and buy additional motorcycle replacement parts for his shop.

She lives with her children, 19 year old Deivi, 14 year old Kevin, and 6 year old Neyeli. Carmen has had to work various jobs to support her family, knowing that all her sacrifices have been for her children. 14 years ago, after much effort, she was able to set up a small hardware store in her house.\r\n\r\nHer business has been growing little by little and Carmen hopes to be able to expand it soon, since every day she gains more customers and earns more income. What Carmen likes about her work is that thanks to her business she can be independent and provide for her family. She works all day and although it leaves her tired to work such long hours in the intense cold during this time of year, Carmen continues working with a lot of motivation to make progress. \r\n\r\nThis is her fourth loan with MFP. Carmen is part of \"Estrella Azul\" (Blue Star) community bank, and is very happy with her group, as the members are all very responsible.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Occidental, earns her living by operating a sari-sari (general) store.  Her husband, Benjie B., 37, works as a teacher, and they have three children ranging in age from one week to eleven years old. <p>\r\n\r\nMay Jane joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2004 because she aspired to something better for her family. With the help of her past eight loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, May Jane has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 19,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 10,000, thus uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her ninth loan, she is borrowing PHP 19,000 which she intends to use to purchase more stock so that she can continue to save up for her family's future needs and home improvements. May Jane B. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams. <p>\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed on a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work. <p> \r\n\r\nHelp NWTF continue its mission to help the poorest in the Philippines by clicking  the link to the NWTF Kiva lending team on Kiva.org to join our

Her husband is a government employee on a meager income and Rubina operates a thread-selling business. She gets thread from used sweaters and sells it to thread retailers for a profit.\r\n\r\nShe has applied for a loan from Kiva partner Asasah for the expansion of her thread-selling business. She will use the loan to buy a large stock of used sweaters. This will help her make more thread which she can then sell to retailers for a good price and increase her household income. She has been doing this for five years and is hopeful that a loan investment will help her to become more profitable.\r\n\r\nShe is a regular loan user of Asasah and this is her second loan application.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed \u2018un-creditworthy\u2019 by financial institutions due to a lack of tangible collateral assets. Poor financial support results in poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.\r\n\r\n<P>SELFINA buys and leases equipment to women.

In this group, members guarantee each other's loans as social collateral (i.e., if one member does not promptly repay her portion of the loan, then the other members are responsible for curing the arrears), and they provide support for one another to repay their respective loans.

Her business is to buy clothes wholesale and sell them on a retail basis.  She works at the business for 8 hours per day, 6 days per week and is assisted by one employee.

Josephine thanks you for your support.\r\n\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":255810,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing

After finishing 10th Grade and getting his teaching credentials from the Center for Teachers' Education-Namaacha, he started working as director of a Boarding School located on the border of Swaziland. He worked taught there for 20 years. Upon getting a scholarship to a university in Maputo and in order to afford the high extra transportation costs of going back and forth from Namaacha to Maputo, he applied for a couple of loans with Hluvuku to start and stock a business of buying and selling car products and accessories such as oil, filters, headlights, etc. For each 5.000.00MT he now spends per week buying merchandise in South Africa, he profits 2.000.00MT by seeling it in Namaacha.\r\n\r\nThis is Pedros' third loan with Hluvuku and the first with Kiva. He plans to use the 14.000,00 to buy more products and accessories to sell. With the help of his wife, he is confident that he will be able to pay off the loan before its term expires.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Aline Pereira, Kiva

Paraiso, Brgy. Taloc, Bago City, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating three business ventures:   poultry raising, food vending (bibingka) and a general store.  Adelfa joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2000 because she aspired for something better for her family. \r\n\r\nWith the help of her past 17 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Adelfa has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 19,500 PHP helped her earn a monthly profit of about $238, thus raising the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 18th cycle loan, she is borrowing 20,000 PHP which she intends to use to buy more stock for her general store and for the maintenance of her piggery and her poultry so that she can continue to save up for future home repairs. She also wants to cover fees for her son who wants to work abroad. \r\n\r\nAdelfa R. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

P., 52, aims to go against the common notion of mediocrity with regard to her business. She is happily married to Norberto, 52, a bus conductor.  They are blessed with two children who are already working. Together, they live in Molino, Bacoor, Cavite.\r\n\r\nRunning a sari-sari (variety) store is Teresita's occupation. She has run this small-scale business for five years. She adapts well to the trends in her neighborhood when it comes to popular brands of food, shampoo, and drinks.  She also sells some children's toys, accessories and kitchen merchandise.  Because of her expertise in this field, she earns at least Php10,000 monthly.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operation of her business, she would like to request a Php50,000 loan. She intends to use this loan to buy more quality merchandise to sell in her store. She knows that having a lot of stock will attract more customers to her store.\r\n\r\nTeresita is doing everything she can in order to see her business grow and expand. She wants to become successful in life, be it in her family life or in her business.  She wants to start another store as a branch someday.\r\n\r\nAs a CCT community partner, she faithfully attends the group's weekly fellowship* meeting where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she received.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance loans.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1150,"image":{"id":730045,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

'Gringas' are the same meat with cheese but on a flour tortilla and served with cilantro, onion and salsa.  Their business is located on a very busy avenue, in a district far from the city where there are few businesses.\r\n\r\nThe couple prepare the food themselves to sell to their customers at a low price and this is their only source of income.  For this reason, Rosa Elba would like to buy raw materials such as meat, spices and tortillas so that they can continue making income to cover their family's expenses."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":768139,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy raw materials for her business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Acuna","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"29.3 -100.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":18,"posted_date":"2011-05-14T12:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":475,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.37,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosa Elba","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-05-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":5247.54,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":282.31},{"due_date":"2011-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":303.91},{"due_date":"2011-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":327.16},{"due_date":"2011-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":352.19},{"due_date":"2011-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":379.13},{"due_date":"2011-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":408.13},{"due_date":"2011-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":439.35},{"due_date":"2012-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":472.96},{"due_date":"2012-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":509.14},{"due_date":"2012-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":548.09},{"due_date":"2012-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":590.02},{"due_date":"2012-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":635.15}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.55},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.51},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.62},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.88},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.32},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.94},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39.77},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.81},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.09},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.61},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.41},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.49}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":25.55,"local_amount":282.34,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T10:51:35Z","rounded_local_amount":295.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216486189},{"amount":27.51,"local_amount":303.93,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:38:16Z","rounded_local_amount":317.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221649222},{"amount":29.62,"local_amount":327.19,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T08:49:38Z","rounded_local_amount":342.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227017026},{"amount":31.88,"local_amount":352.21,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T08:41:43Z","rounded_local_amount":368.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232776327},{"amount":34.32,"local_amount":379.56,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T09:45:02Z","rounded_local_amount":396.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238580744},{"amount":36.87,"local_amount":407.76,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:39:35Z","rounded_local_amount":426.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.07,"payment_id":244539064},{"amount":39.77,"local_amount":439.79,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-16T08:48:15Z","rounded_local_amount":459.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250749707},{"amount":42.81,"local_amount":472.96,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-17T07:42:35Z","rounded_local_amount":494.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263704165},{"amount":203.3,"local_amount":2281.8,"processed_date":"2012-05-08T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T13:37:06Z","rounded_local_amount":2385.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":3.3,"payment_id":283109557}],"funded_date":"2011-05-16T04:18:29Z","paid_date":"2012-06-15T13:37:06Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Oxnard","image":null}},{"id":301898,"name":"Mujeres Emprendedoras Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Anastacia runs a small bakery producing and selling candies.

Albina is 32 years old, attended school up to 9th grade, is the single mother of a girl and is expecting a second child. She lives is the Alto Trujillo Projects in the Florencia de Mora district of the Trujillo province. Ms. Albina started her business with a loan of approximately $96 she obtained from \u201cLas Conquistadoras\u201d Communal Bank. With that loan she bought fruits and vegetables to sell at the market of the Victor Larco district at the Trujillo province. With her next loan, she incorporated little outdoor coal stoves (\u201cbriquetas encendidas\u201d) to her sales, which yielded a higher income. However, due to her pregnancy, she was forced to stop selling them, as the emanated smoke constituted a health risk. With the latest loan of approximately $286, given by Manuela Ramos, she bought corn and all kinds of produce to sell at a regular stand she now has in that same market. Ms. Albina dreams about traveling to the Sierra, to her native village of Cuyuchugo, in order to bring potatoes and other products to sell in bulk. She also wants to own her stand at the market. \r\n<p> <b>Translated from Spanish by Leticia Britos, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\nLa se\u00f1ora Albina tiene 32 a\u00f1os de edad, estudi\u00f3 solo hasta tercer a\u00f1o de secundaria, es madre soltera de una ni\u00f1a y est\u00e1 en espera de otro beb\u00e9. Vive en el Asentamiento Humano Alto Trujillo del Distrito de Florencia de Mora de la Provincia de Trujillo, Departamento de La Libertad. La se\u00f1ora Albina inici\u00f3 su negocio con el pr\u00e9stamo de $ 96 d\u00f3lares aproximadamente, que recibi\u00f3 del Banco Comunal \u201cLas Conquistadoras\u201d, con lo cual compr\u00f3 frutas y menestras para poner a la venta como ambulante en el mercado del distrito de V\u00edctor Larco en la Provincia de Trujillo. Con su siguiente cr\u00e9dito, se dedic\u00f3 tambi\u00e9n a vender briquetas encendidas (peque\u00f1as cocinas de carb\u00f3n de piedra), negocio con el que obten\u00eda mayor ganancia, pero tuvo que dejarlo debido a su embarazo, ya que el humo que emana es perjudicial para su salud. Con el reciente pr\u00e9stamo otorgado por Manuela Ramos de $ 286 d\u00f3lares aprox., compr\u00f3 ma\u00edz para chufla y todo tipo de menestras para vender en un espacio fijo que ahora tiene en el mismo mercado. La se\u00f1ora Albina sue\u00f1a con viajar a la Sierra, a su pueblo natal, Cuyuchugo, para traer papa y otros productos y venderlos al por mayor.

Con las ganancias anteriores ha aprovechado en comprar vacas, de las que vende su leche a 1.5 soles el litro, adem\u00e1s, cada vez tiene m\u00e1s becerritos. Por ello, sus  anhelos son de comprar m\u00e1s vacas que le generen ingresos extras a su hogar. Los dem\u00e1s integrantes est\u00e1n en el d\u00e9cimo cr\u00e9dito con MFP, mientras que Clorinda va por el octavo pr\u00e9stamo, pues ingres\u00f3 a su banco comunal cuando ya ten\u00eda un a\u00f1o de formado; por otro lado, ella se siente muy alegre por lo que viene ahorrando junto a su grupo. El dinero que ahora solicita lo utilizar\u00e1 en la compra de funguicidas que erradiquen los gusanos que atacan la oca y la papa, el resto lo invertir\u00e1 en la compra de fertilizantes qu\u00edmicos.","en":"Clorinda is 42 years old. She is a very hardworking mother with 4 children, 3 of whom live in her house. Clorinda has been working everyday since she was very young because agriculture is the only activity that she knows and that has been yielding great profits all these years. For this reason, she really likes her potato and oca (a root vegetable) crops. Thanks to them, her children have not experienced financial difficulties. Sometimes she also works on her neighbors\u2019 farms, where she gets paid 12 PEN daily, including lunch. With this money, she can pay for her elderly mother\u2019s expenses and for her children\u2019s studies. However, when she has to cultivate her own crop fields, Clorinda and her husband make it a priority until they end up sending their products to market. She has made the most of her previous earnings by purchasing some cows, selling their milk at 1.5 PEN a liter. Furthermore, her cows keep having more and more calves. For this reason, she hopes to purchase more cows, which will increase the household income. The rest of the members are on their tenth loan with MFP, while Clorinda is on her eighth loan because she joined the microfinance institute a year after it was formed. Nevertheless, she feels very happy because she has been saving money with her group. The money that she is now requesting will be used in purchasing fungicides to eradicate the pests that attack her potatoes and oca. She will also invest in purchasing chemical fertilizer.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Elizabeth Casian, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":349415,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Purchase fungicides and fertilizer ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-07-09T07:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Clorinda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-06-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":3000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":1000,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2010-02-11T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:48:55Z","rounded_local_amount":3045,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123959557}],"funded_date":"2009-07-09T19:12:00Z","paid_date":"2010-03-15T10:48:55Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Elizabeth Casian","image":845142}},{"id":124865,"name":"Mujeres Hacia Adelante Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"The communal bank \u201cMujeres Hacia Adelante\u201d (Women Moving Forward) is pictured here.

He resides with his wife and two children in a traditional family with other households in the Sido Sonincoura district of the city of S\u00e9gou (4th administrative region of the Republic of Mali).  He attended Koranic school, and in the fourth grade (of the education system of Mali), he dropped out.  Then he started to run income-earning businesses, such as gardening, with his father.  Thanks to the income derived from this business, he started selling vegetable oil at the Chateau marketplace seven years ago and enjoys a large number of customers and fame.  Sales are made using a manual pump, which measures the oil.  \r\n\r\nConcerned about satisfying continually growing customer demands, he has turned toward Soro Yiriwaso, with which he has been associated for 12 months.  After one individual loan, properly repaid, he is now on his second loan, which he intends to use to buy 200 liters of vegetable oil (either in 10- or 20-liter containers) locally in S\u00e9gou from wholesale merchants.  \r\n\r\nHe sells at the retail level while accepting cash or credit from customers composed of men and women.  \r\n\r\nHe envisions realizing a monthly profit of 70,000 francs CFA that will enable him to provide for his family and to increase his working capital.  His ambition is to expand his business and to diversify it.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva

She came to the province center to sell coal and firewood in 2005. She takes orders from customers and delivers coal and firewood to their homes. She began making clothes and sewing handcraft items in addition to her business. Now her husband operates a transportation business using his mini-truck. Their children still help them, even though they have their own lives. \n\nEnhtuya is a hardworking person who says, \"my husband and I have been trying hard to help our children start their own lives and we still need to make money to support our life. We want to continue operating our business.\" She is requesting a loan of 1,800,000 MNT to purchase clothing that she can sell at the local market.

key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

raising a daughter who is of pre-school age. Anara has her own livestock business, which she started in 2005 with a starting capital of 25,000 somi (KGS). Thanks to Anara's hard work and persistence, her farm, which began with one heifer and one steer, is generating a monthly income of 5,000 som (KGS) from the sale of milk and dairy products. Aiming to further develop her business, Anara has asked Bai Tushum & Partners for a loan of 70,000 som (KGS) to purchase additional cattle and feed. Anara plans to invest the proceeds from the loan into increasing her number of cattle, and dreams of building a new home for her family

She has been her family's primary income earner for the past few years with her husband suffering ill health due to attacks by rebels while still in the war zone of northern Uganda.\r\n<br><br>\r\nThrough her hard work, she managed to set up a small retail shop with her first Kiva loan, which she obtained through LiA. To date, she has only made one late loan payment. Her shop has been doing well and through it she has managed to pay fees for her children and buy some household items.\r\n<br><br>\r\nShe however feels that she can do better by adding more stock to the shop.

Some of these members were members of other communal banks before.\r\n<p>\r\nThe associates start to save with an initial deposit of 100, 150, or 200 soles. They then receive a loan which will be invested in their business. The associates work in different types of businesses such as: selling chicken, groceries, fish, cattle, meat, ice cream, bread, food, weaving, and transportation.\r\n<p>\r\nEach associate has a different history that they can tell. One example is Liz, who has a small grocery store. She started with only a small amount of capital; with this loan, she will be able to expand her business. On the other hand, Maura is an artisan. She weaves beautiful tapestries and wall hangings. She learned this art from her parents when she was very young. Maura was invited to join this bank by her sister who is a member of another communal bank. Maura hopes to export her tapestries and constantly innovate her art. Meanwhile, Haydee makes ice cream. She started her business with a manual machine; with her savings, she was able to buy an automatic ice cream maker.\r\n<p>\r\nThe associates need loans of different sizes. Some need 300, 450, or 600 soles reaching a total of 6000 soles in loans from the communal bank. (1USD = almost 3 Peruvian soles). They will invest these loans in buying things such as sugar, milk, beans, rice, fish, soap, flower, butter, animals, wood, and dyes which are necessary for their businesses. Their dreams are to have their own land, house, or business, and for their children to be professionals and improve their economic standing."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2025,"image":{"id":112075,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"The associates will invest these loans in buying things such as sugar, milk, beans, rice, fish, soap, flower, butter, animals, wood, and dyes which are necessary for their businesses.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":70,"posted_date":"2008-01-09T17:45:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2025,"lender_count":71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Noemi Soledad","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nicolas Alicia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maura","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Beatriz","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Haydee","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Victoria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Carmen Rosa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Benedicta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Liz Karina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marcelino","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alicia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lucila","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Cipriana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Manuel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yeni","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-01-23T22:08:57Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":6000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":2025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2008-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2008-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2008-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2008-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2008-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":337.5},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":337.5},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":337.5},{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":337.5},{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":337.5},{"due_date":"2008-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":337.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":338,"local_amount":1001.48,"processed_date":"2008-02-23T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-07-23T09:31:15Z","rounded_local_amount":1008.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":140847},{"amount":338,"local_amount":1001.48,"processed_date":"2008-03-23T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-07-23T09:31:15Z","rounded_local_amount":1008.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":164488},{"amount":338,"local_amount":1001.48,"processed_date":"2008-04-23T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-07-23T09:31:15Z","rounded_local_amount":1008.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":189568},{"amount":338,"local_amount":1001.48,"processed_date":"2008-05-23T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-07-23T09:31:15Z","rounded_local_amount":1008.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":217627},{"amount":338,"local_amount":1001.48,"processed_date":"2008-06-23T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-07-23T09:31:15Z","rounded_local_amount":1008.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":246588},{"amount":335,"local_amount":992.59,"processed_date":"2008-07-23T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-07-23T09:31:15Z","rounded_local_amount":999.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":275112}],"funded_date":"2008-01-09T22:08:57Z","paid_date":"2008-07-23T09:12:30Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":34746,"name":"Namugongo B Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"The group leader of this small group is Sylvia N..

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

They live in large traditional families with their husbands, children and co-wives. On average, they are 42 years old, married and have at least 3 children.The S\u00e9rieux  group buys and sells cosmetics, clothing, firewood and fruits and vegetables.  In order to expand their businesses, the group decided to join the Soro Yiriwaso loan program. They just had their first group loan.  Awa Kamat\u00e9, who is the leader of the group, buys and sells clothing.    She is in high demand because she is located at a good place at the Darsalam market.  She plans to use her loan to buy different kinds of clothing. She obtains these goods wholesale at the Koutiala Grand Market and sells them retail for cash and credit to a largely female clientele.

He lives with his mother in a home he owns.  The house is located in the village of Guaraguaos in the agricultural district of Tambogrande, located near the Piura region.  The Piura region is four hours from the city of Chiclayo, the capital of the Lambayeque region.  \r\n\r\nHector has dedicated himself to agricultural work for the past 15 years.  He raises livestock, particularly sheep, on the land behind his home.  His father, who passed away, taught him how to do this, so he knows the trade well.  Hector also dedicates himself to growing and selling lemons and mangos.  He helps his mother support their family with the income he generates from these activities.  \r\n\r\nHector would like to buy more fertilizer for his lemon crop to improve the production and quality of the fruit.  For this reason, he believed it would be beneficial to request a 1000 PEN loan from Edpyme Alternativa, an organization that is helping him realize his goals."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":712589,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farm Supplies","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy fertilizers for his crops","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Tambogrande -

He has won laurels for the good-humored way he relates to clients who purchase goats and local gin from him. This has, in many respects, put his business in the running. Though he still has much more ground to make up to solidify his niche, he remains upbeat about success. For Jackson, the sky is the only limit.\r\n\r\nJackson, who is happily married with 6 lively kids, plies his trade in Bushenyi. His business took root 6 years ago. In those 6 years, he has strengthened his insight on how to run a business proficiently. Jackson says his goat sales trade is much more profitable than his local gin business, but he runs them concurrently and does not have any regrets.\r\n\r\nOn the side, Jackson also subsists on income from a modest farming business.

In thirteen years being a TYM Fund member, Mrs. N. has always used her loan in raising animals to increase her family's income.  With diligence and experience, her farm has grown significantly.  Each month, with 6,000,000 VND (equivalent to 345 USD) from raising pigs and chicken and from her three children's wages,  Mrs N. is able not just to give TYM the repayments but also to save some money towards her children's schooling.  In the coming loan cycle, she'd like to borrow 20,000,000 VND (equivalent to 1150 USD) to buy more pigs and food for pigs.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Vietnamese by Phuong Nguyen, Kiva
