For four years she has been selling household products on foot, assisted by her husband, offering her merchandise in far off places in her rural area. The benefit that Nelly grants is that she gives credit and, 15 days later, she returns to collect and sell again. What she offers to her customers depends on the occasion: in this cold season, her customers request blankets. In school season, they request school uniforms and other various articles. For Nelly, this work is profitable because she earns a reasonable profit with each product that she sells so it justifies the effort she and her husband put forth. For the future, Nelly wishes to grow her market, traveling to other places to offer her merchandise. This is the second time that she has taken a loan with MFP. She is very happy to continue a joint effort with her community bank. Her wish is that she continues this work despite difficult circumstances that might crop up. The money that she is requesting is to stock up on more household products which are her working capital.

She lives with her 2 children, who study courses at university, and her house is her own. As a specialist in the art of handicrafts, she makes plush dolls, bordered in material, adorned with diverse material, among others. She has done this activity for 9 years and has a small workshop in her house, where she also trains a group of single mothers in different styles of handicrafts, so that they can be covered economically. Ida really likes her job because she meets every type of person, and it is also profitable enough to cover the expenses of her home. For the future, Ida wants to have a cleaning product business, additional to her handicraft business. This is her fifth loan with MFP, and she likes to work with her communal bank because they are all working women with the desire to overcome their problems.

She has 2 years of experience in this business. Sinavailemalama needs a loan of 1,500 WST to purchase weed-killers, such as Gramoxome. She plans to use the profit from her business (estimated to be 600 WST or US $250 per week) to improve the general living conditions of her family.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Sinavailemalama joined SPBD to gain access to financial services. Most of SPBD's clients are unable to borrow from commercial banks, because they lack collateral. This is Sinavailemalama's second loan with SPBD. \r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD:\r\n\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem. Please join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD.\r\n\r\nSPBD evaluates the living conditions of each of its borrowers. Generally, a loan manager evaluates a variety of social metrics on a scale out of 3 (the higher the number, the better off the person is) and thE. are averaged for the \"overall social metric score\".  For example, a 3 out of 3 on \"level of education\" would mean that the borrower has graduated from university.

Ikromidin is 37 years old. He lives with his wife and has two children. Like his parents, who cultivated large crops, he has been a farmer since he was a boy. He enjoys being a farmer. Like his brother, he plants crops and then eventually he or his wife takes the products directly to market to sell. This way, he does not have to give away any of his efforts to middlemen.\r\n<p>\r\nFarming brings Ikromidin good earnings. He tells us that to succeed, you only need to know how to take care of what you plant and to pay attention to what the crops need. Therefore, he fertilizes his crops so that he has a good harvest. \r\n<p>\r\nThis is his fourth loan with IMON International and he is responsible with his payments. The money he is requesting will be invested in high-quality seeds and fertilizer. Ikromidin is very grateful to everyone who is helping him to achieve his goals with this loan.  \r\n<p>\r\nMore about Tajikistan\r\n<p>\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes being a key post along the Silk Road and being the location of the end of the rule of Alexander the Great. It is also known for its famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi, and many others. The country, filled with epic mountain passes, is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, and boasts a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture, and Central Asian traditions. \r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 percent of the country is mountainous and only 7 percent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n<p>\r\nMore about IMON International\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Los Alcarrizos is a community on the outskirts of Santo Domingo, the capital of the Dominican Republic.

He is 61 years old and operates a business selling basic staples: beans, rice, sugar, maize, chicken.  His wife helps him with sales.  He started the business with savings and a redundancy payment that he received from a former employer.  He started with a small grocery, but then switched to selling larger volumes of basic staples.  Chicken, for example, and it's for chicken sales that he needs a loan because he wants to buy another freezer to store enough chickens to meet demand.  He also wants to buy a display case for his products.  He hopes to increase his sales and invest in more supplies of basic staples.  The advantage of these loans is that he has been able to use them to rebalance the business as well as increase his sales.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jere Wiseman, Kiva

The water is not potable.\n\nAntonio makes his home in a simple structure with his long-term partner and  4 children.

He plans to continue doing business and enjoying the time he spends with his children.\n\nAntonio is excited to be taking out his third loan with Esperanza after having successfully repaid his previous loan and growing his business. He has had his business for 8 years, starting with a candy stand. He plans to use this loan to purchase 3 bags of rice, 2 bags of sugar, 3 big cans of oil and beans for his business.

She plans to use the profit from her business (estimated to be 500 WST or US $208 per week) to improve the general living conditions of her family.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Sinuu joined SPBD to gain access to financial services. Most of SPBD's clients are unable to borrow from commercial banks because they lack collateral. This is Sinuu's second loan with SPBD. \r\n\r\n*SPBD evaluates the living conditions of each of its borrowers. Generally, a loan manager evaluates a variety of social metrics on a scale out of 3 (the higher the number, the better off the person is) and these are averaged for the overall social metric score.  For example, a 3 out of 3 on \"level of education\" would mean that the borrower has graduated from university.  \r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.

Neema thanks you for her support!\r\n\r\nABOUT SELFINA!\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions.

She is 24 years old. She attended school until 10th grade, and she's the single mother of a 6-year-old boy. In addition to her son, she also supports her nephew and a sister.\r\n\r\nIn 1992 she left Maputo to live in Matola with her family, and she's still there. Ol\u00edmpia is a full-time shopkeeper, owner of her own business. She's worked for four years by herself, without any employees.\r\n\r\nShe learned business from a friend in Maputo and has 8 years of experience. She sells bedsheets and other cloth goods (duvets, handkerchiefs, curtains, etc.). She buys some of her products in South Africa at 1500 meticals and sells them at 3000 meticals. She earns 12,000 meticals a month, which she uses to support her family. She is also able to save a little each month.\r\n\r\nThis is her first loan with Hluvuku-Adsema, in the amount of 11,000 meticals. She will use it to stock her store. She's never had loans from other institutions. She heard about Hluvuku-Adsema through a friend who had received a loan from the organization.

He started this business in 2006 in the Attiegou district in Lome. He sells wholesale most of the time to liquor retailers. This business lets him take charge and he can afford the necessities of life. With time he realised that his business is very profitable. He buys his supply in Ahepe, located many kilometres from Lome. Most of his clients like the quality of his product. He wants very much to replenish his stock because he is almost completely out. For this he is requesting a loan from Wages (Kiva Field Partner) so that he will be able to purchase 5 barrels of sodabi.

She had to bring her guts and determination to bear in the face of such low expectations from some of her disparaging friends.\r\n\r\nWith huge reserves of optimism and with a desire to prove her detractors wrong, 35-year-old Sauda embarked on her mission \u2013 to get established in the business genre of her preference, to wit: a produce sales and small commodity wholesale business. She went out of her depth to fight off the early financial quagmires that had reared their heads and were making her chances of success hang in the balance.\r\n\r\nSauda started getting into her stride when she began selling rice, groundnuts (peanuts), beans and millet. When her prospects began improving, her down-the-line attitude got even better. As a consequence, all her three children, who were hitherto not going to school, began attending school.\r\n\r\nSauda\u2019s customers are mostly small retailers. In a month, she says she earns to the tune of 600,000 shillings. She is also a counselor within her locality. With this loan she wants to buy some produce she has not sold before like coffee and cotton. She also wants to buy more matches, textbooks and tea leaves for her wholesale stock.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3725,"image":{"id":527519,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To purchase crops such as coffee that she has not sold before and also some wholesale stock","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Lugazi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.377222 32.919722","type":"point"}},"partner_id":84,"posted_date":"2010-04-21T16:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":3725,"lender_count":112,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sauda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jane","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Joyce","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eva","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Salongo","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Salongo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ruth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yona","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Abudu","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Doreen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juliet","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Immaculate","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Harriet ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":7750000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":3725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1937500},{"due_date":"2010-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1937500},{"due_date":"2010-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1937500},{"due_date":"2010-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1937500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":931.25},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":931.25},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":931.25},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":931.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":931.25,"local_amount":1937500,"processed_date":"2010-04-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:53:13Z","rounded_local_amount":1942355.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136734004},{"amount":931.25,"local_amount":1937500,"processed_date":"2010-05-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:48:43Z","rounded_local_amount":1942355.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144767318},{"amount":931.25,"local_amount":1937500,"processed_date":"2010-06-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-20T07:46:02Z","rounded_local_amount":1942355.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":152662336},{"amount":931.25,"local_amount":1937500,"processed_date":"2010-07-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:46:22Z","rounded_local_amount":1942355.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159689108}],"funded_date":"2010-04-24T19:53:19Z","paid_date":"2010-08-15T11:46:22Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jeff Avery","image":233371}},{"id":198668,"name":"Llankasunchis De Lares Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Los socios del banco comunal \u201cLlankasunchis de Lares\u201d se re\u00fanen cada treinta d\u00edas en la oficina de atenci\u00f3n de la unidad de micro finanzas de la Asociaci\u00f3n Arariwa de la ciudad del Lares.

This is 40-year-old Bibie H. M. from Dar es Salaam. She is single with two children between the ages of 4 and 10. Additionally, she is responsible for supporting one dependent because his parents cannot take care of him. Bibie has been selling an African traditional cloth called khanga since last month. She works at the business for five hours per day, eight days per week. Currently she earns about $100 USD from her business. She is requesting a loan in order to purchase stock in bulk. Bibie thanks you for her support!\r\n\t\r\nKiva partner SELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of microcredit in Tanzania through microleasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed noncreditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":288748,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing

She resides and works in a semi- urban area which is on the outskirts of Kampala. Joyce sells smoked fish in the Kalerwe market, one of the Kampala suburbs. She sells to an average of 25 people a day and to all categories of people. She works seven days a week. Joyce buys fish from the Gaba market and uses public transport to and from shopping. Her major monthly expenses include rent for her shop. She has been in this business for the last seven years. Her main challenge is the rainy season  which stops her customers from coming to her. Joyce has been with MCDT for over five years and is using her tenth loan, working all this time with the same group members. She wants to use this loan to buy more fish and partly to pay school fees.

a\u00f1os a la crianza y venta de cerdos y aves, ella cr\u00eda los animales en la parte posterior de su vivienda y los vende a los negociantes que usualmente visitan la zona en donde vive.

Con este ingreso ella y su esposo pueden mantener a su familia.\n\nLa continua demanda por cerdos en la zona han hecho que ella est\u00e9 pensando en ampliar su negocio, por ese motivo se ha visto en la necesidad de solicitar a Edpyme Alternativa un cr\u00e9dito de 1500 nuevos soles que piensa invertir en la compra de cerdos medianos, alimento balaceado y en la mejora de los corrales en donde los cr\u00eda, ya que no cuenta con el suficiente espacio para realizar esta acci\u00f3n.\n\nJuana es una madre de familia bastante responsable y trabajadora.

She breeds the animals in the back of her house and sells them to the dealers who visit the area where she lives. This activity is very important to their family income since her husband is a farmer and this occupation does not provide a consistent income.\r\n<p>\r\nThe need to support their family has also caused them to start saving money to buy a motorcycle taxi which they currently lease to offer transportation services in the area. With this income she and her husband can support their family.\r\n<p>\r\nThe continued demand for pigs in the region has gotten her thinking about expanding her business and to do this she has seen the necessity of asking for a loan from Edpyme Alternativa for 1500 nuevos soles to buy pigs, balanced feed, and improve the pens they live in since currently their is not enough space.\r\n<p>\r\nJuana is a very hardworking and responsible mother to her family.  Her biggest wish is to be able to offer her children the opportunity to study and have a promising future.

Lezel has been engaged in her business for over 2 years and earns approximately 7,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Lezel joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. Lezel has successfully repaid a previous loan of 13,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional inventory & working capital. Lezel is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This will be the 5th loan taken out by Lezel from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement the income of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

This is 33-year-old Ruth M. from Mbarali. Married with one child aged four, she is additionally responsible for supporting two dependents whose parents cannot take care of them.

Even in the most remote villages in Africa, there is usually some kind of \u2018bar\u2019 selling Coke, Fanta, and Guiness (Pepsi has made it to most African capitals but not to the sticks, but I\u2019m sure they\u2019re working on it!). The hot weather makes soft drinks all the more appealing - a very cheap marketing tool! This explains why selling soft drinks is such a popular venture, whether you\u2019re the CEO of Coca Cola Ltd in the United States or a micro-entrepreneur in Tanzania! \r\n\r\nABOUT SELFINA:\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets; thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":237841,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Soft

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture, and Central Asian traditions.  On the other end of the spectrum, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and thus only 7% of the land is arable; accordingly, this confluence of factors has resulted in high levels of unemployment and has forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries (primarily Russia).  Even though the people of Tajikistan are working hard to improve the country's agriculture and manufacturing sectors, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <p>\r\n\r\nIMON International's History:\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition.

Revina thanks you for her support!\r\n\r\nABOUT SELFINA\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":337626,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty Salon","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"To purchase hair pieces for beauty salon.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mwanza","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.516667 32.9","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-06-16T22:50:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Revina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-08-29T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-11-27T08:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-12-27T08:00:00Z","amount":83333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-07-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:40:57Z","rounded_local_amount":87333.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63233241},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-08-29T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:54:30Z","rounded_local_amount":87333.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73665034},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-09-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T02:48:30Z","rounded_local_amount":87333.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87105746},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-10-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T06:29:12Z","rounded_local_amount":87333.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97022856},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-11-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:42:31Z","rounded_local_amount":87333.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103868097},{"amount":66.65,"local_amount":83333.35,"processed_date":"2009-12-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T16:45:03Z","rounded_local_amount":87333.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110757293}],"funded_date":"2009-06-17T14:20:29Z","paid_date":"2010-01-15T16:45:03Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tammea Arthur","image":1739710}},{"id":119999,"name":"Julieth","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Julieth tiene 20 a\u00f1os, es una joven muy trabajadora que vive en la casa de sus padres, quienes siempre la apoyaron para salir adelante.

She lives with her parents; they have always helped her to get ahead.  Even though she is very young, she feels that she has the responsibility to help her parents with the household expenses.\r\n\r\nShe now has an Internet caf\u00e9, which she was able to install thanks to her parents\u2019 help.  She runs and administers the business herself.  Her business is in a very good location because there are not many like it in her zone.  What Julieth likes best about her work is taking care of her customers.  The hardest part is that she must, by herself, take care of everyone who comes to her Internet cafe.  She has been doing this for two years.\r\n\r\nIn the future she hopes to be able to increase the number of computers that she has.  She knows that she has to work hard to reach her goals.  She is prepared to do so.\r\n\r\nThis is Julieth\u2019s fourth loan with MFP.  She expects to be able to make her payments on time, the same as she did with her previous loans.  She is very happy in her Community Bank.  She is always up to date with the agreements made in the group meetings.\r\n\r\nShe will use the 2,000 PEN that she is asking for to fix one of her computers.  Continual usage has caused some problems.  With the rest of the money she will buy plastic chairs for her business. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":347152,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Internet Cafe","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"Computer repair","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Juliaca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15.5 -70.133333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-07-04T17:40:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":675,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Julieth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-06-03T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":333},{"due_date":"2009-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":333},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":333},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":333},{"due_date":"2009-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":333},{"due_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":335}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.39},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.39},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.39},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":112.39},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":112.39},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":113.05}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":112.39,"local_amount":333,"processed_date":"2009-07-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:39:03Z","rounded_local_amount":342.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63211965},{"amount":112.39,"local_amount":333,"processed_date":"2009-08-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:17:26Z","rounded_local_amount":342.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73641493},{"amount":112.39,"local_amount":333,"processed_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:28:25Z","rounded_local_amount":342.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87080932},{"amount":112.39,"local_amount":333,"processed_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T02:58:32Z","rounded_local_amount":342.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96997074},{"amount":112.39,"local_amount":333,"processed_date":"2009-11-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:53:04Z","rounded_local_amount":342.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103842419},{"amount":113.05,"local_amount":335,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:56:33Z","rounded_local_amount":344.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103842420}],"funded_date":"2009-07-05T01:38:07Z","paid_date":"2009-12-15T13:56:33Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ginny Kalish"}},{"id":124095,"name":"Kucherboi","description":{"languages":["ru","en"],"texts":{"ru":"\u041c\u0430\u0445\u043c\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0435\u0432 \u041a\u0443\u0447\u0435\u0440\u0431\u043e\u0439 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0436\u0438\u0432\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u0432 \u0440\u0430\u0439\u043e\u043d\u0435 \u0425\u0443\u0440\u043e\u0441\u043e\u043d\u0430. \u0412\u043e\u0437\u0440\u0430\u0441\u0442 42 \u0433\u043e\u0434\u0430. \u0416\u0435\u043d\u0430\u0442, \u0438\u043c\u0435\u0435\u0442 5 \u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0439. \u041a\u0443\u0447\u0435\u0440\u0431\u043e\u0439 \u0431\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0435 8 \u043b\u0435\u0442 \u0437\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0436\u0438\u0432\u043e\u0442\u043d\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0434\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e\u043c. \u041e\u043d \u043e\u0442\u043a\u0430\u0440\u043c\u043b\u0438\u0432\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u0438 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u0441\u043a\u043e\u0442 \u043d\u0430 \u0440\u044b\u043d\u043a\u0435. \u0415\u043c\u0443 \u0432 \u044d\u0442\u043e\u043c \u0442\u0430\u043a\u0436\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u043c\u043e\u0433\u0430\u044e\u0442 \u0434\u0435\u0442\u0438. \u041a\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0438\u0442 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0438\u0442 \u0434\u043b\u044f \u0437\u0430\u043a\u0443\u043f\u0430 \u043a\u0440\u0443\u043f\u043d\u043e \u0440\u043e\u0433\u0430\u0442\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0441\u043a\u043e\u0442\u0430.","en":"Kucherboi M. lives in the Hurosona district.

Con este pr\u00e9stamo de S\/. 3,000.00, comprar\u00e1 repuestos y aceites como: lubricantes, bocamasas, buj\u00edas; para as\u00ed brindar un mejor servicio y atender mucho mejor al cliente. Parte del dinero, tambi\u00e9n lo invertir\u00e1 en la compra de alimentos y vitaminas, para sus animales. Elda, como le dicen de cari\u00f1o, nos cuenta: Que el pertenecer a un grupo de mujeres le ha ayudado a conocer mejor sus derechos y juntas  hacer que estas sean respetadas. Y agradece al Movimiento Manuela Ramos, por ayudarla a iniciarse en el campo empresarial. ","en":"Elda is a member of the \u201cLos Diamantes\u201d community bank in the district of Eslab\u00f3n, province of Bellavista, department of San Mart\u00edn. She is married, 55-years-old, and the mother of two grown children. For one year, she has been providing urban transportation services in her motorcar. In order to do this work, her husband takes care of moving about the different places in the city. Her start came with her first Manuela Ramos loan, and little by little she was able to begin saving, and this money went to buy spare parts in order to better serve the inhabitants in her community. Also, Elda has a farm located 2 kilometers outside the city, where she raises her animals, among them pigs and chickens. It also contains a fish farm, where she raises her fish. With this loan of 3,000.00 soles ($1050), she plans to buy parts and oils, such as lubricants, and spark plugs in order to provide much better service and care to her customers. Part of the money will also be invested in buying feed and vitamins for her animals. Elda states that belonging to a group of women has helped her to better know her rights and make it so they are all respected. She is grateful that the Movimiento Manuela Ramos has helped her begin her faming venture. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Sarah Merchlewitz, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":427087,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Taxi","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"To buy parts to improve her transportation service","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"San Mart\u00edn","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":72,"posted_date":"2009-12-01T08:01:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1050,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-10-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2009-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2010-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2010-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2010-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2010-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":350,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2009-12-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T15:08:06Z","rounded_local_amount":1004.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110727795},{"amount":175,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2010-01-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:06:14Z","rounded_local_amount":502.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118118168},{"amount":175,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2010-02-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:44:25Z","rounded_local_amount":502.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123953886},{"amount":175,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2010-03-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-23T07:54:51Z","rounded_local_amount":502.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128986961},{"amount":175,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2010-04-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-02T07:56:31Z","rounded_local_amount":502.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136713092}],"funded_date":"2009-12-16T18:42:36Z","paid_date":"2010-06-02T07:56:31Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sarah Merchlewitz","image":188300}},{"id":157064,"name":"Maria  Laura","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":" La Se\u00f1orita Maria Laura T.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She also rents washing machines.  Before having her own business, she worked as domestic help, but always dreamed of being independent and being able to spend more time with her children. She started both businesses with her severance pay.  So in addition to purchasing a washing machine to rent out, she began to make lunches and sell them to her neighbors.  She now has three washing machines, sells lunches in her neighborhood, and also takes care of houses and businesses in the northern part of the city.  Some of them pay her weekly.  \r\n\r\nShe has received two loans from Fundacion Mario Santo Domingo that have allowed her to increase her working capital. Since she started her business, she has more time for her family, particularly for her youngest son.  When she worked as a maid she had to ask relatives for help raising her two oldest kids because she only came home on weekends.  \r\n\r\nWith her new loan of $1.500.000 COP, she will buy supplies at wholesale and another machine.  She is also going to start another business in a high school near her home -- she is going to take care of the cafeteria.  Her dream is to only have one business that is profitable enough, and provides enough stability, to to be able to finish educating her kids. Her newest challenge is to be able to make a go of it in the high school where she will take care of the cafeteria and she has great hopes of being able to get ahead with her newest project.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Shelly Hubman, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":552361,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Wholesale supplies and another washing machine.

Most of SPBD's clients are unable to borrow from commercial banks because they lack collateral. This is Vaiola's second loan with SPBD. \r\n\r\n*SPBD evaluates the living conditions of each of its borrowers. Generally, a loan manager evaluates a variety of social metrics on a scale out of 3 (The higher the number, the better off the person is.) and these are averaged for the overall social metric score.  For example, a 3 out of 3 on \"level of education\" would mean that the borrower has graduated from university.  \r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.
