She lives in a house she owns with her husband, 40-year-old Teofilo, and her three beloved children, whose quality of life she wishes to improve. In Saliciana's life, the green fields of her land have been a very pleasant place to work. Her parents taught her this kind of labor since she was very young, and now she owns her own land which she works on with great care and sacrifice. She has cacao, coffee and plantain crops and owns a total of 2 hectares of land. What she likes most about her work is to harvest her land, because that is how she feels that the months of hard work are rewarded by the quality of her produce. She has been in the business for 15 years and believes that the hardest part is transporting her crop from her farm to the stockpile centers located in the city of San Francisco.\r\nWith the requested loan she will purchase materials in order to finish setting up her house. In time, she hopes to save enough money to buy more land so she can leave it to her beloved children as inheritance. This will be her seventh loan with MFP and because of that she needs the support of the lenders in order to fulfill her goal. Furthermore, she is committed to making her repayments punctually and thankful for being a member of her communal bank. With the 3.000 nuevos soles she requested, she will purchase corrugated metal sheets, nails and wood planks."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":854574,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":null,"use":"to purchase corrugated metal sheets, nails and wood planks for her house.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"CUSCO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.518333 -71.978056","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-08-28T16:50:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1100,"lender_count":38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Saliciana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-08-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":3000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1100}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":1100,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-22T08:31:02Z","rounded_local_amount":3010.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276712804}],"funded_date":"2011-08-30T21:50:26Z","paid_date":"2012-05-22T08:31:02Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Renata Wolff","image":null}},{"id":333545,"name":"Zoila Teresa","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Zoila de 33 a\u00f1os de edad, vive con su familia en su casa propia, cuenta con todos los servicios b\u00e1sicos, ubicada en la zona urbana del distrito de Pacasmayo que pertenece al departamento de La Libertad.

She and her husband support one-another.  She runs a small grocery store from her home and it is well stocked.  She says that things are going well for her and that she has steady customers.\r\n\r\nShe is asking for this loan so that she can expand her business, now that her physical space is getting to be too small and she wants to continue expanding.\r\n\r\nThis group was formed four cycles ago and despite a few small problems, they always manage to come out ahead.  Adela was the treasure when the group began and she always completed her duties very well and was very responsible with the members\u2019 savings.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3825,"image":{"id":918726,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery

This meant that she had to quit her job at the store and start a new one.  About 20 years ago, she decided to sell bread in the mornings at a bus stop near her house. Unfortunately, she realized a few years ago that this job wasn't making her enough money as it did before.  This is why she began selling refreshments like soda and beer from her home.

She hopes to recover soon and attend to her business without having to ask for help (she still doesn't make enough profits to hire staff).

She is very punctual in her payments and her credit history is the best letter of recommendation for her responsibility.  The money that she requests will be invested in the purchase of the necessary materials to increase her production of embroidered goods in order to take advantage of the local period of festival costumes of her zone.  That is when there is greater demand for these items.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Barbara (B) Brown, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":366090,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Embroidery","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"To buy textile materials for creating embroidered items","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"HUANCAYO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.066667 -75.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-08-09T22:10:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Claudia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-07-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":148.06},{"due_date":"2009-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":154.95},{"due_date":"2009-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":163.22},{"due_date":"2009-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":169.75},{"due_date":"2009-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":178.2},{"due_date":"2010-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":185.82}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.82},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.23},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.13},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.41},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.37},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65.04}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":51.82,"local_amount":148.06,"processed_date":"2009-08-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:20:06Z","rounded_local_amount":154.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73641706},{"amount":54.23,"local_amount":154.95,"processed_date":"2009-09-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:34:59Z","rounded_local_amount":161.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87081148},{"amount":57.13,"local_amount":163.22,"processed_date":"2009-10-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:04:48Z","rounded_local_amount":170.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96997298},{"amount":59.41,"local_amount":169.75,"processed_date":"2009-11-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:54:11Z","rounded_local_amount":177.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103842643},{"amount":127.41,"local_amount":364.02,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T15:24:55Z","rounded_local_amount":379.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734218}],"funded_date":"2009-08-10T01:22:38Z","paid_date":"2010-01-15T15:24:55Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"B Brown","image":120650}},{"id":131940,"name":"Rose","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rose A. lives in Lumbia, Cagayan de Oro City.

At her age, she never tires of doing things to make money for everyday living. Her four children, Ludy, Gemma, Joel and Roque, sometimes give her some money from their salaries because they are now employed. But Conchita does not stop working because she knows her children also need income for their own families. She wants to be the one who helps her children's families, especially for her grandchildren. That\u2019s why she decided to join and borrow from Ahon sa Hirap Inc. (ASHI), a Kiva field partner, to get the capital that she needed to start her food preparation business and her restaurant. \r\n\r\nNow, her business is still running, but she needs another loan to expand her business and diversify her menu. She will use her second loan from ASHI to buy rice, pork, vegetables, and spices. This will make her business grow.\r\n\r\nConchita has a simple dream. Preventing her family from experiencing the hard things will make her happy. That\u2019s why she will never tire of helping

It has produced famous thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. A civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged an already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural productivity and the manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent viable business prospects. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

With the help of her past 3 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Viriginia has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 11,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 4,700!\r\n\r\nThis time, for her 4th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 13,000 to buy more stocks for her general store so that she can continue to save up for future home repairs and expansion of her business.

Considering the high demand for her products, Rosalinda would like to request a larger loan. \r\n\r\nFor Rosalinda\u2019s previous performance in ASHI, she has maintained a 100% rating in terms of repayment, attendance to weekly center meetings and her business. Aside from proving her competence to other people, Rosalinda has also discovered that she has the ability to grow her business and to be responsible in paying a loan she used as an investment in her business.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. A civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients have a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

This will make her more income and she will be able to aspire to a better quality of life."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":746258,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy paper, detergent, salt, sugar, sweet bread, candies, etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Lourdes Col\u00f3n, departamento de La Libertad","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":81,"posted_date":"2011-04-12T11:00:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":500,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Santos","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-03-09T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":33.64},{"due_date":"2011-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":35.44},{"due_date":"2011-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":36.2},{"due_date":"2011-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":38.02},{"due_date":"2011-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":38.96},{"due_date":"2011-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":40.41},{"due_date":"2011-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":42.24},{"due_date":"2011-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":43.48},{"due_date":"2011-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":45.32},{"due_date":"2012-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":46.78},{"due_date":"2012-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":48.53},{"due_date":"2012-03-09T08:00:00Z","amount":50.98}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.64},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.44},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.2},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.02},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.96},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.41},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.24},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.48},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.32},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.78},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.53},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.98}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":33.64,"local_amount":33.64,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-20T07:45:39Z","rounded_local_amount":33.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206733295},{"amount":35.44,"local_amount":35.44,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-16T08:00:31Z","rounded_local_amount":35.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211388602},{"amount":36.2,"local_amount":36.2,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-18T07:52:19Z","rounded_local_amount":36.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216448774},{"amount":38.57,"local_amount":38.57,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:13:18Z","rounded_local_amount":38.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221612832},{"amount":38.63,"local_amount":38.63,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T08:21:46Z","rounded_local_amount":38.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":226982111},{"amount":40.48,"local_amount":40.48,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-20T07:45:20Z","rounded_local_amount":40.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":233430757},{"amount":42.33,"local_amount":42.33,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T09:20:45Z","rounded_local_amount":42.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238545738},{"amount":43.77,"local_amount":43.77,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:12:37Z","rounded_local_amount":43.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244505336},{"amount":45.11,"local_amount":45.11,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T09:16:51Z","rounded_local_amount":45.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250712821},{"amount":46.97,"local_amount":46.97,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T09:28:28Z","rounded_local_amount":46.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257115701},{"amount":98.86,"local_amount":98.86,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T08:26:45Z","rounded_local_amount":98.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263240840}],"funded_date":"2011-04-15T20:59:56Z","paid_date":"2012-03-15T08:26:45Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Oxnard","image":null}},{"id":292574,"name":"Ren","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Ren was born in 1953.

Mehriniso is 55-year-old mother of five children. Her husband is a driver, and they both are loving parents. Mehriniso and her husband are working hard to ensure the future for their children. Mehriniso has her own business for eight years already. She started as the seller of clothing. Gradually she is becoming more involved in this business and is dreaming of opening her own trading place. Now she is selling women's clothes and shoes in the store which is located in the central local market. <p>\r\nMehriniso is a friendly and polite woman. She is trying to diversify the range of goods to satisfy the needs of the clients with the various levels of income.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility.

This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.

She is the mother of four children, two of whom are in school and the others are working. She lives in Eguase in the central region of Ghana. Her husband is a crop farmer and has been very supportive of her. Life, she says, has not been as easy for her as she had expected, but she hopes and trusts in God that her dream of becoming well to do will come to pass. Hannah is very hardworking and dedicated to the upbringing of her children. She sells sweet potatoes and lemons, and it is from the proceeds of her business that she has managed to support her family. Hannah has mounted a stand by the major road side of Cape Coast where she sells her products. She takes delivery of stock from the surrounding farming communities and has been in business for twenty years now. She needs a loan to buy more sweet potatoes and lemons so that she can meet the demand from her customers. She would be grateful for your assistance.

She is 42 years old. Josephin is married and has two adult children. To make a living, Josephin owns and operates a general store. The main source of income for the business comes from selling a variety of different products in the local community. Josephin is just starting this business.\r\n\r\nIn 2000, Josephin joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Josephin has successfully repaid a previous loan of 7,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional products to sell. Josephin is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional inventory and as working capital. This will be the 13th loan taken out by Josephin from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

With his wife Maria, he has two grown children, who are working professionals and independent.  His business is about 8 years old.  He was able to start working for himself with the help of savings he accumulated from jobs he held previously.  That is, his business is the result of earnings derived from his work as a traveling salesman.  Today Eladio and Maria run the business, and through their efforts it has experienced regular growth and stands up to the competition.  \r\n\r\nEladio has his own home.  He would like to purchase in larger quantities, to benefit from discounts and thus enjoy a larger profit margin from his sales.

After this experience, with his own resources, he started his own business installing alarms, locks, radios and selling sound boxes for cars a year and a half ago. He lives with his parents and his 4-month-old daughter who is in his care and is his greatest motivation to build a promising future with his business that leads to success together.\r\n\r\nIn his business, he sells car alarms, alarms and central locking, radio and installation, as well as making speakers and sound boxes for cars. His little working capital obliges him to make purchases in small quantities and with a lot of frequency because after selling the item, with that same money, he stocks and replaces the item he sold. This is one of the reasons why he uses crediKiva, which is the first loan that he made with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, and with which he will buy wooden boxes, alarms, speakers, automatic locks, radios and tools to improve the offerings of his shop, where he offers the service of installing equipment, car audio systems and makes speakers as well. He dream is to position himself in the market, becoming known for the good quality service that he offers and for the products that he sells in his store since, currently, stocking is his greatest challenge, as well as not having his own home. While Andres builds his dreams, he persists in his work in a responsible and disciplined manner to achieve them."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":774582,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Manufacturing","sector":"Manufacturing","themes":null,"use":"To buy wooden boxes, alarms, speakers, automatic locks, radios and tools to improve his shop's offer.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Bogot\u00e0","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2011-05-23T13:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":300,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Andres Dario ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-05-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":76554},{"due_date":"2011-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":80896},{"due_date":"2011-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":82446},{"due_date":"2011-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":84027},{"due_date":"2011-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":85637},{"due_date":"2011-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":90440}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.93},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.54},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.47},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.41},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.39},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.26}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":45.93,"local_amount":76554,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:09:50Z","rounded_local_amount":83459.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216509513},{"amount":48.54,"local_amount":80896,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:49:01Z","rounded_local_amount":88192.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221673745},{"amount":49.47,"local_amount":82446,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-17T08:01:09Z","rounded_local_amount":89882.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227320307},{"amount":50.41,"local_amount":84027,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:07:01Z","rounded_local_amount":91606.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232803435},{"amount":51.39,"local_amount":85637,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:16:56Z","rounded_local_amount":93361.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238614512},{"amount":54.26,"local_amount":90440,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-25T08:51:45Z","rounded_local_amount":98597.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244568475}],"funded_date":"2011-05-24T03:53:59Z","paid_date":"2011-12-25T08:51:45Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":304884,"name":"Yaa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Yaa makes soap locally called \"Don\u2019t Touch Me\" for sale at Abura.

She lives in the rural parish of Pifo in Quito, Ecuador.  She has lived in her own house in the Amazonas neighborhood for one year.  She has a high school education.\r\n\r\nTwo years ago she started a business of raising pigs, which she learned from her parents.  In order to do this, she rents a metal structure where she keeps the pigs.\r\n\r\nShe wants the loan to buy balanced feed and more pigs.  That way she will expand her business, which will improve her income and her quality of life.

They have 7 children between the ages of 17 \u2013 33 years old with 2 of them having their own family. Three are currently employed while the other 2 are currently going to school and also help their parents in the business as part of their daily chores.\r\n\r\nConcordia joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2000 in the hope that she would be able to help her husband improve the quality of life of their family. With the help of her loans from NWTF-PD she has been able to increase their family income by engaging in buying and selling dried fish. Now she earns an average monthly income of Php 10,000 from her business activities.\r\n\r\nConcordia is a member in good standing. Her previous loan of Php 19,500 was used to fund the operations of her dried fish business which has had a positive impact in both the business and the family\u2019s living conditions. Now she is taking out her 8th loan in the amount of Php 19,500, which she intends to use on her dried fish venture. Concordia is working hard to achieve her dreams and aspirations for her family, which are to provide them with a brighter future and a more comfortable life.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress out of earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":498506,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish

His goal for later on is to sell larger volumes especially to small markets and also to bring the cheese directly from the town of Magdalena.\r\n\r\nHis main challenge is working capital because with growing clientele it\u2019s insufficient and this is precisely what he\u2019d be solving with his Kiva loan which he\u2019ll use to buy cream cheese, whey, corn dough and disposable packaging to attain excellent packaging.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":864464,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy cream cheese, corn dough and disposable containers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2011-09-12T19:00:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":300,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Otto ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-08-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":41860},{"due_date":"2011-11-04T07:00:00Z","amount":45948},{"due_date":"2011-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":47020},{"due_date":"2012-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":48117},{"due_date":"2012-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":49240},{"due_date":"2012-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":50389},{"due_date":"2012-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":51565},{"due_date":"2012-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":52768},{"due_date":"2012-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":53999},{"due_date":"2012-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":59094}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25.12},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.56},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.22},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.87},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.54},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.23},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.94},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.66},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.4},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.46}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":25.12,"local_amount":41860,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:18:30Z","rounded_local_amount":44756.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238614946},{"amount":27.56,"local_amount":45948,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:58:56Z","rounded_local_amount":49127.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244568888},{"amount":28.21,"local_amount":47020,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T10:20:44Z","rounded_local_amount":50273.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257188606},{"amount":219.11,"local_amount":365172,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:36:13Z","rounded_local_amount":390441.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294338172}],"funded_date":"2011-09-16T15:31:58Z","paid_date":"2012-08-15T09:36:13Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":337697,"name":"Arnold","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Arnold is a businessman who runs a salon and a barber shop.

She earns a minimum of 500 pesos in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operation of her business, she is requesting a 15,000-peso loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, and beverages to expand her product inventory.

called Las Abuelas.  The members decided to name it that because the majority of the women in the group are already grandmothers, and they also consider themselves grandmothers of the group, mothers of their companions.  The group is made up of 9 hardworking, modest, creative women, artisans with good virtues.  They tell us they are very contented because with their work they feel proud of their indigenous roots, of wearing  \n\"naguas\" [traditional skirts], and of being Mexican.\n\nOne of the members of the group is M\u00f3nica, a hardworking woman who has worked making napkins and tablecloths for 12 years.  She tells us that what she likes most about her business is sewing and making the figures on her napkins and tablecloths.  Moni, as her companions of the group know her, is happily married to Margarito, with whom she has three children.\n\nShe requested the loan to buy more colored thread, needles, and ribbon to make napkins and tablecloths.  Moni tells us that she began to weave at a young age because her mother worked making napkins to sell in the neighboring towns.\n\nThe other members of the group are Mar\u00eda, who makes napkins; Modesta, who makes napkins; Cecilia, who sells napkins and tablecloths; Ciria, who sells napkins; Luciana, who sells napkins; Roc\u00edo, who sells napkins and tablecloths; Josefa, who sells napkins and tablecloths; and Inocencia, who makes napkins.\n\nThey are grateful to the foundation for the support it has given them to get ahead, to triumph in life, and to continue doing what they like, which is to make napkins and tablecloths.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2175,"image":{"id":946256,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Embroidery","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"to buy thread, needles, and ribbons for embroidery.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2011-12-27T20:30:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2175,"lender_count":67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Monica ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Modesta  Alberta ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Cecilia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ciria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Luciana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rocio ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Josefa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Inocencia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-12-14T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":30000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":2175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":1875},{"due_date":"2011-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":1875},{"due_date":"2012-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":1875},{"due_date":"2012-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":1875},{"due_date":"2012-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":1875},{"due_date":"2012-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":1875},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1875},{"due_date":"2012-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":1875},{"due_date":"2012-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":1875},{"due_date":"2012-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":1875},{"due_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","amount":1875},{"due_date":"2012-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":1875},{"due_date":"2012-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1875},{"due_date":"2012-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":1875},{"due_date":"2012-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":1875},{"due_date":"2012-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1875}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":135.94},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":135.94},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":135.93},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":135.94},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":135.94},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":135.94},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":135.93},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":135.94},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":135.94},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":135.94},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":135.93},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":135.94},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":135.94},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":135.94},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":135.93},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":135.94}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":271.88,"local_amount":3750,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:12:57Z","rounded_local_amount":3760.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250785267},{"amount":543.75,"local_amount":7500,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T10:28:27Z","rounded_local_amount":7520.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257193843},{"amount":679.68,"local_amount":9375,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:41:41Z","rounded_local_amount":9400.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263330200},{"amount":543.75,"local_amount":7500,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T09:41:02Z","rounded_local_amount":7520.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270044217},{"amount":135.94,"local_amount":1875,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:52:12Z","rounded_local_amount":1880.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276656432}],"funded_date":"2011-12-28T00:45:37Z","paid_date":"2012-05-15T09:52:12Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Catharine Wall","image":1532414}},{"id":378692,"name":"Umazi","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Umazi, 49, is a married woman with six children, five of whom attend school.

For the last 10 years, Yordan has supported his wife and two children (aged 14 and 17) by his work with walnuts.  Yordan drives around Bulgaria buying walnuts in their shells by the sack.  Upon his return to Sliven, he weighs the sacks and gives each to one of his independent contractors.  The contractor removes the walnuts from their shells and returns the shelled walnuts to Yordan.  Weighing the sacks before their distribution lets Yordan know approximately how many kilos of shelled nuts should be returned, to prevent his contractors from siphoning off his nuts.  Yordan provides work for approx 50 people for 5 days when he brings in a load of nuts to be shelled.  Yordan then sells his walnuts at the major nut markets in Sofia and Burgas.  <p>\r\n\r\nCurrently, Yordan can afford to buy 2,000BGN (1,300USD) worth of walnuts at a time, which he sells 10 days later for 2,500BGN (1,625USD).  After salaries and expenses (gas for his van to drive around Bulgaria buying and selling the nuts), Yordan nets approximately 200BGN (130USD), which he can do every two weeks or so.  This loan will give him the capital to increase the amount of nuts he can buy at a time (nearly double), employing more people in the Roma ghetto of Sliven.  <p>\r\n\r\nThe Roma, commonly referred to

M.'s Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This is a cross section of the teachers of the Magburaka Boys School. Magburaka Boys School is the oldest secondary school in the Northern Province of Sierra Leone. Several of the country's dignitaries passed through this school. When the Revolutionary United Front Rebels seized the town in 1997, they made the school as one of their camps. Before they left, the previous boarding school was totally mutilated and vandalized. Teachers, pupils, matrons and all fled the campus, leaving it a ghost town. However, with a peace treaty between the government and rebels in 2002 and with subsequent remobilization and reintegration of ex-combatants, life began again in the township of Magburaka. Schools reopened, but the Boys School reopened only to find a well-mutilated and vandalized school, with most of its former teachers not willing to come back. Only some of the few teachers were willing to come back and face the challenge of lifting Magburaka Boys School to its former height once again. It's a difficult task, in a country where most qualified teachers are fleeing to seek greener pastures overseas, where teachers' salaries are low, and in a country where textbooks are difficult to come by. But they are determined to bring the Boys School back to its former glory.\r\n\r\nTo keep themselves from having to flee like other Sierra Leoneans, most of these teachers, especially the younger ones, also engage in some other trades to supplement the meager salaries they receive from government. Thus, they need a loan to enable them to promote their businesses. Others will give their loans to their wives to invest in businesses. Some will use the loan to purchase building materials, others will use it to purchase pieces of furniture, and a few of them will want to pay school fees and other related charges for their children and dependants. \r\n\r\nHere is an introduction to these teachers:  Hassan M. C., for this purpose the group leader, is 32, and was born in Kambia Northern Sierra Leone. He is single with no children. He will invest his loan in his business as he did with his previous loan. This time, Hassan expects to buy 10 bartars (5 gallons makes a bartar) of palm oil. Although during his first loan, he experienced several hiccups such as bad roads to market places, and business colleagues not adhering to deadlines, Hassan said he will be able to overcome these challenges with this loan. He also said that the previous loan helped him a lot, as he was able to pay for his junior brother's school fees and at the same time feed his perents.\r\n\r\nOther members of the group include:   Edward C. S., Musa Ben M., Francis A.K. T., Musa M. K., Dominic S. K., Namisa S., Daniel S. K., Adama P. F., Andrew B. F., Samuel K., Hassan O.M. B., Peter S. K., John M. C. and Teddy P.

","en":"Maria is a hard-working woman, dedicated to the development and wellbeing of her children, whom she has educated to be professionals. Now she lives alone with her husband and her youngest daughter, with whom she shares her best moments in a home that is full of memories. The wellbeing of her children motivated her to start work very young. The costs of her children\u2019s education were high but worth it. Thanks to her efforts today her children are professionals and have established a store in her home so that Maria could stop working away from home and dedicate herself to her household. For 10 years she has attended her store selling groceries and candies. Thanks to the location, she has good profits everyday, above all in the mornings until noon when most of the mothers and students visit her. Despite her good standing, she requires more products to increase her profits and help her to save and have an economic support for her old age and her husband\u2019s, who is also a hard-worker. He has a locksmith\u2019s shop, and together they proviD. for their future. With her work group she has founded many friendships and she likes doing things with her friends. The uncomfortable part is when it\u2019s necessary to be severe with those that don\u2019t fulfill their responsibilities with assigned payments. For this reason, she solicited her first individual loan from MFP, and in this way has more possibilities to grow as a businesswoman.

He is requesting a loan to buy auto parts so he can meet his customers' expectations.\r\n<p>\r\nStephen is the leader of a trust bank group called \u2018Trust in God.\u2019 He is the one standing at the back in the group photograph. \r\n<p>\r\nMost of the members of this group are petty traders, food vendors, and\/or farmers. They buy their raw materials or goods from other towns and sometimes from nearby communities and sell their wares at the local market square. Some of them journey to other towns to sell their goods on their market days as well. The members have been in business for some time and have amassed a great deal of experience in their businesses. They are therefore asking for loans to help them procure more goods so to be able to expand their businesses. \r\n<p>\r\nIn this group, members guarantee for one another as social collateral to access the loan and support each other in  repaying the loan.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2275,"image":{"id":356159,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Auto Repair","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"To buy auto parts for his vehicle repair business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GH","country":"Ghana","town":"Sefwi Wiawso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"8 -2","type":"point"}},"partner_id":88,"posted_date":"2009-07-21T03:20:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2275,"lender_count":68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Stephen ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Cynthia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Veronica","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Akosua","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hanna","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Georgina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-07-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GHS","disbursal_amount":3400,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":2275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":377.78},{"due_date":"2009-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":377.78},{"due_date":"2009-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":377.78},{"due_date":"2009-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":377.78},{"due_date":"2009-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":377.78},{"due_date":"2010-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":377.78},{"due_date":"2010-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":377.78},{"due_date":"2010-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":377.78},{"due_date":"2010-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":377.76}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":252.78},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":252.78},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":252.78},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":252.78},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":252.78},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":252.78},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":252.78},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":252.78},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":252.76}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":252.78,"local_amount":377.78,"processed_date":"2009-08-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T22:15:29Z","rounded_local_amount":379.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73670728},{"amount":252.78,"local_amount":377.78,"processed_date":"2009-09-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T03:28:25Z","rounded_local_amount":379.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87109332},{"amount":252.78,"local_amount":377.78,"processed_date":"2009-10-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T06:47:56Z","rounded_local_amount":379.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97025486},{"amount":252.78,"local_amount":377.78,"processed_date":"2009-11-18T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:48:44Z","rounded_local_amount":379.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103870030},{"amount":252.78,"local_amount":377.78,"processed_date":"2009-12-18T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T16:53:18Z","rounded_local_amount":379.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110759347},{"amount":252.78,"local_amount":377.78,"processed_date":"2010-01-18T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-04T09:22:25Z","rounded_local_amount":379.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118148052},{"amount":252.78,"local_amount":377.78,"processed_date":"2010-02-18T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-26T07:58:46Z","rounded_local_amount":379.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123986198},{"amount":252.78,"local_amount":377.78,"processed_date":"2010-03-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-18T08:26:35Z","rounded_local_amount":379.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":129017023},{"amount":252.76,"local_amount":377.76,"processed_date":"2010-04-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-18T08:28:28Z","rounded_local_amount":379.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136742095}],"funded_date":"2009-07-29T20:20:20Z","paid_date":"2010-05-18T08:28:28Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Maeve","image":1271729}},{"id":127869,"name":"Iyau","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":" Iyau E. is currently in the business of selling various items in her shop and is requesting a loan to expand her stock.

San Jose Baling, Libacao, Himamaylan City, Negros Occidental, is 48 years old and married to Panfilo L., Jr. who presently manages their sugarcane farm. They are blessed with three children who are 12 to 15 years of age, and are all in high school. They strive hard to earn enough this year because their oldest daughter is about to start college next year, with the two younger ones following fast behind.\r\n\r\nThe family has a small sugarcane farm, which is a seasonal type of business. It is harvested only once a year. As the demand for a better cash flow increased as their daughters were growing, Victoria knew she had to find an alternate means of income. This is why she joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2000 to access capital to start a general store.\r\n\r\nBecause of her skills in predicting which products would be popular with her customers, Victoria was able to build her business with the help of her loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon. She was even able to help her husband fund some of the operations in their sugarcane farm. Now her General Store earns her an average monthly income of PHP 15,000.\r\n\r\nHer previous loan of Php 29,500 was used as additional working capital for her general store and for her sugarcane plantation. Her loan was fully paid on time within the loan term. Now for her 22nd cycle, she is borrowing the same amount, Php 29,500, for her general store. The income will be used for house renovation, savings for education and for future investments.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the calling of not just a few but thousands of women. Through the alleviation program, these women have progressed from earning less than a measly $1 a day, to surpassing the realities beyond their dreams.

She owns a business venture, selling both food & daily use products in the local community.  Lesina has 3 years of experience in this business.  Lesina needs a loan of WST $1500 to purchase additional products to sell.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 450 tala or US $188 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Lesina joined SPBD.  This is her 2nd loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Lesina's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Lesina L. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.4 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.3 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.4 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              1.4 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

She is a 54-year-old single woman from the village of Centro Sur, Alcala, Cagayan. Edna has been in her business for over eight years and earns approximately 3,000 Philippine pesos (PHP) a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Edna joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living conditions and enable her to engage in business activities. Edna is requesting a loan of 5,000 PHP which will be used to purchase raw ingredients needed to make products for sale. This will be her first loan from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue to save as a reserve for future emergencies. \r\n\r\nEdna is the leader of a six member group accessing a loan offered by ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members, if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\n<b>About ASKI:<\/b>\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the central and northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n<i>Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

He is 49 years old, married, and the father of five children between the ages of 1 and 18.  The four eldest go to school. M\u00e1rio finished sixth grade but did not continue because of the death of his parents.  He lives in his own house with his family and supports his sister and sister-in-law, who live in Inhambane, by sending them 1,000 meticais every three months.\r\n \r\nHe left Inhambane Province to go with his elder brother to Namaacha, on the border with Swaziland, after losing his parents.  He continued with his studies and finished sixth grade.  Later he was employed by TDM as a telecommunications service operator.  He has been a permanent employee there for more than 16 years and earns a salary of 5,500 meticais, working from 7:00 am until 2:00 pm on the morning shift and 2:00 pm until 10:00 pm on the evening shift. When he married his wife, living with his brother was no longer agreeable, so he felt he should leave the house and live in a rented house while he built his own; but since he did not have enough money to complete the project, he approached Hluvuku-Adsema and asked for a loan to continue the work.\r\n\r\nThis is M\u00e1rio's third loan with Hluvuku and his second with Kiva.  The first loan of 8,000 meticais and the second of 20,000 meticais were used to buy construction materials, but owing to rising costs of materials, he was not able to finish the house.  This third loan for 15,000 meticais will be used for the same purpose.

Aisalkyn and her husband, a pensioner, live on their own while the youngest of their three children helps in the household. They live in Tup, a rural area that does not have any industry or trade potential. Instead, the major occupations for local residents are agriculture and cattle breeding. The farmers cultivate not only traditional vegetables, fruits, and grain crop, but also try to innovate new exotic types of agricultural products. Aisalkyn, along with other group members, is getting ready to begin spring fieldwork. She grows mainly vegetables in large amounts, because she was fortunate to acquire a large plot of land in 1996. Large profits are gained in fall, when the harvest is gathered. Her monthly income is 3,000 soms.

Because of his long experience, he has an excellent reputation and orders plenty of salon and other supplies, but he doesn't have the resources necessary to meet demand. For this reason, he decided to join micro-finance institution Soro Yiriwaso. He is currently on his fourth individual loan, the previous loans have all been fully repaid. \r\n\r\nThis fourth loan will allow him to buy 6 new clippers, 8 sets of brushes and combs, 6 barrels of bleach, 6 bottles of 90\u00b0 alcohol, 6 boxes of deodorants, 15 boxes of Pharmapure soap, 2 dozen assorted perfumes and 2 boxes of Timor  insecticide. Ibrahima buys his supplies in Bamako (Mali's capital) for use in his salon located along the R.N. 7 main road. His customers are mostly young people.\r\n\r\nWith this loan, he expects to make a monthly profit of 240,000 CFA francs. With the  profit he makes, he plans to be able to meet most of his own and his family's expenses, pay the interest on the loan and invest the rest in his business."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":884712,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty Salon","sector":"Services","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"to buy supplies for his salon.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sikasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.316667 -5.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2011-10-06T00:03:17Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1050,"lender_count":40,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ibrahima ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-09-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":1050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2012-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2012-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2012-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2012-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":210},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":210},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":210},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":210},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":210}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":210,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2011-11-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T11:12:26Z","rounded_local_amount":101521.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244655552},{"amount":210,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2012-01-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:48:05Z","rounded_local_amount":101521.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257283165},{"amount":210,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2012-03-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-11T08:20:01Z","rounded_local_amount":101521.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270139940},{"amount":210,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2012-05-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T19:01:23Z","rounded_local_amount":101521.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283251706},{"amount":210,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2012-07-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:38:37Z","rounded_local_amount":101521.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294448933}],"funded_date":"2011-10-16T01:22:03Z","paid_date":"2012-08-15T10:38:37Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sarah Puchner","image":669957}},{"id":345919,"name":"Gladys Ann","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Gladys Ann is 26 years old and lives in the Philippines.

their own back yard.  To improve her business, Rogelia would like to ask for financial support amounting to PHP10,000.  She will use the loan to buy different kinds of vegetables in the public market which she will sell in their village.  She only goes to the market twice or thrice a week, since they have a limited access to transportation.  Part of the loan will also be used to buy a variety of vegetable seeds which she will plant in their back yard. Through her business, she can help her husband in meeting the needs of their family and somehow uplift their lives.<p>\r\n\r\nShe is aware that she is getting old and while she has the strength, she will do her best for their family.  Her husband Valeriano is a farmer and they both work as laborers when they are not busy with their own businesses for additional income.  They have poor living conditions and keep struggling to live a better way. Their five children are: Rocky \u2013 25 years old, a vocational course graduate; Conrado \u2013 22 years old, grade four; Lorvy \u2013 19 years old, high school graduate; Marlito \u2013 17 years old, who never had the chance to study and Rubelyn \u2013 9 years old, currently in grade two. <p>\r\n\r\nThey live in a mountainous village of Cabisera in Isabela province. Despite poverty, they manage to have a good relationship in the family and are all hoping to have a progressive life.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":336953,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She produces underwear, bathing suits and performs custom alterations.\r\n\r\nRosa plans to use this loan to invest in a new sewing machine as well as sewing materials (thread, fabric, elastic etc.). With an increase in working capital, Rosa is confident she will be able to expand her business and gain the ability to better satisfy the needs of her clients. Her goal is to increase the revenue from her sewing business in order to make a more significant contribution to family income. \r\n\r\nEvery day, Rosa wakes up early to start sewing before she prepares breakfast and cleans the house.
