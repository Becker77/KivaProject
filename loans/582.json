Elle prenait les poissons \u00e0 cr\u00e9dit et les revendre pour payer apr\u00e8s l\u2019op\u00e9ration. C\u2019\u00e9tait une fa\u00e7on de lui initier \u00e0 l\u2019auto prise en charge. Cependant  les petits b\u00e9n\u00e9fices cumul\u00e9s de son business informel lui a permis de se constituer un capital de 50$ pour d\u00e9marrage. Et un peu apr\u00e8s, elle a profit\u00e9 le 1er cr\u00e9dit de l'IMF Hekima.\nAu paravent, quand  madame Kavira S.  avait un petit fond de rotation, elle vendait les poissons du lac Virunga (en RD Congo) anciennement appel\u00e9 lac Edouard, lac Idi Amine en provenance de la pecherie de vitshumbi et Nyakakoma, deux villages situ\u00e9s respectivement \u00e0 150 km de la ville de Goma. Plus tard, lorsqu\u2019elle se vit  son capital  augmente en volume, immediatement elle a pr\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9  changer l\u2019axe d\u2019approvisionnement pour r\u00e9aliser plus des profits, elle vend des poissons Tilapia provenant de lac Victoria de l\u2019Ouganda. La sp\u00e9cificit\u00e9 de ces poissons, ils sont plus gros par rapport aux poissons de lac Edouard. Il y a 8 ans qu\u2019elle exerce cette activit\u00e9 de vente des poissons. Elle s\u2019installe sur le lieu public, route Katindo, entr\u00e9e du camp Militaire.\nAvec  le cr\u00e9dit  de  l\u2019IMF Hekima, Kavira S. souhaite augmenter son chiffre d\u2019affaire en achetant  600 kg des poissons  frais appel\u00e9s \u00ab gros tilapia\u00bb.\nMadame Kavira S., explique le d\u00e9fi majeur de son activit\u00e9 est li\u00e9 \u00e0 la pourriture de poisson, surtout lorsque le glace (glacier) est finiou transform\u00e9 en liquide pour garder les poissons en \u00e9tat frais. En outre le transport de leur marchandise de l\u2019Ouganda-kampala vers la RD Congo pose un probl\u00e8me d\u2019autant plus qu\u2019il n\u2019y a pas assez des v\u00e9hicules transporteurs impliqu\u00e9s dans ce secteur de transport poisson. Par exemple \u00e0 ce jour, madame Kavira S. n\u2019a pas des marchandises parce que il n'y a que\u2019un seul v\u00e9hicule qui fait ce trafic routier transfrontalier, et seulement 3 ou 4 operateurs ougandais qui font ce transport avec leurs v\u00e9hicules jusqu'au fronti\u00e8re entre l'Ouganda et le RD Congo.\nDans l\u2019avenir, elle ambitionne louer, elle seule un camion de poissons Tilapia sans se faire liguer avec d\u2019autres associ\u00e9s de sa corporation.  Elle reste tr\u00e8s optimiste en soulignant qu\u2019un jour elle sera grand fournisseur des poissons tilapia dans la ville de Goma. Dans le futur, elle souhaiterait  acheter sa propre parcelle et y construire une maison, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 qu\u2019elle est encore locataire de maison. \nMadame Kavira S. remercie l\u2019IMF Hekima pour  les cr\u00e9dits  qu\u2019elle re\u00e7oit sans aucune garantie mat\u00e9rielle car gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 ces cr\u00e9dits, elle parvient \u00e0 subvenir aux besoins de ses enfants.\n\n\n\n\n","en":"Kavira S. is an entrepreneur, a seller of tilapia fish.\u00a0 She is a 14th cycle client, 27 years old, married, and the mother of two children, aged 9 and 4.\u00a0 Both are in school.\u00a0 Her son, the eldest, is in the third grade, and the other is in kindergarten.\u00a0 Kavira's husband is also a fish seller.\u00a0 She and her husband help each other in this business selling tilapia.\u00a0 She started her small business with her own funds.\u00a0\n\nKavira was once a small-scale merchant, a fish seller without working capital, a retailer.\u00a0 She used to speculate with goods (fish) belonging to her friends and acquaintances who were already wholesale merchants.\u00a0 She got the fish on credit and resold it, paying afterward.\u00a0 This was a way for her to become familiar with self-sufficiency.\u00a0 Meanwhile, the small profits from her informal business accumulated and enabled her to build up $50 in capital to start off.\u00a0 A year later, she availed herself of the first loan with the micro-finance institution Hekima.\u00a0\n\nIn the past, when Kavira had a small revolving fund, she used to sell fish from Lake Virunga (in the Democratic Republic of the Congo) formerly called Lake Edouard, Lake Edi Amine from the fishery of Vitshumbi and Nyakakoma, two villages located 150 km from the city of Goma.\u00a0 Later, when she saw her capital increase in volume, she immediately favored changing her supply source in order to make more profit.\u00a0 She sells tilapia from Lake Victoria in Uganda.\u00a0 These fish are specifically bigger compared to the fish from Lake Edouard.\u00a0\n\nShe has been in this business selling fish for eight years.\u00a0 She situated herself in the public space on Katindo Road, at the entrance to the military camp.\u00a0 \n\nWith the Hekima loan, Kavira wishes to increase her sales by buying 600 kg of fresh fish called gros tilapia.\u00a0\n\nKavira explains that the major challenge in her business is related to fish spoiling, especially when the ice has turned liquid in the cooler for keeping the fish fresh.\u00a0 Furthermore, the transport of Uganda-Kampala merchandise toward the Democratic Republic of the Congo poses a problem, as much as there are not enough transport vehicles involved in this sector for transporting fish.\u00a0 For example, today, Kavira has no merchandise because there was not one vehicle running the trans-border trade in the DRC, and only three or four economic Ugandan operators using their vehicles to take fish as far as the border.\u00a0\nIn the future, Kavira has the ambition to lease, on her own, a tilapia truck without joining forces with other companies in her corporation.\u00a0 She remains very optimistic, emphasizing that, one day, she will be a major supplier of tilapia in her city of Goma.\u00a0 For the future, she wishes to buy her own plot of land and to build house on it, since she is still renting a house.\u00a0 \n\nKavira thanks Hekima for the loans she receives without the need for any collateral at all because, thanks to these loans, she is managing to meet the needs of her children.\u00a0 \n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":536599,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish Selling","sector":"Food","themes":["Conflict Zones"],"use":"600 kg of fish","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CD","country":"Congo (Dem.

She is in a common-law relationship with Elmer, who is a farmer.  Aurelia and her partner live with their three children, which is why she strives to move forward.  They live together in their own home.  Aurelia\u2019s work consists of selling juices.  In the mornings, she prepares breakfast and juices from her own shop at the market in Campo Verde.  She opened her business five years ago and has become well-known in the market over time.  In addition, she has the support of her daughter who helps with making juices and attending to customers.  What Aurelia enjoys most about her work is being able to socialize and earn an income in a peaceful manner so that she can provide the best for her children.  The part she does not like is dealing with the unstable prices of the products she uses for making juices, such as fruits, because they are rising.  However, this has not stopped her from continuing her growth.  Aurelia has plans to open a motor parts store.  \r\n<p>\r\nThis will be her third loan with the MFP organization.  She feels very comfortable with her group because she is very familiar with the other members when it comes time to work.  Aurelia is excited about continuing with her group.

Ice Plant, Brgy. Sebucao, San Enrique, Negros Occidental since birth.  She is now 42 years old and is married to Teodoro T. who works as a baker in one of the bakeries in Bacolod City.  They had 3 daughters but unfortunately one died because of an illness.  \r\n<p>\r\nShe joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2004 and had her first PHP 3,000 loan which she used as additional capital in her food vending business. But the main purpose for why she joined was the insurance coverage that all NWTF-Project Dungganon members enjoyed -  she knew that her family would benefit from such coverage.\r\n<p>\r\nEdelyn knew how precious such security would be to her family because at the time that she joined NWTF-Project Dungganon, she was already burdened with the health problems of her youngest child. The hardship and heartache she experienced with her child's medical difficulties did not hinder her from exerting more energy to sustain her food vending business. Instead it gave her the strength to continue moving on for she knew that NWTF-Project Dungganon would be her only refuge in her mission to improve her family's standard of living. Sometime in 2006, in spite of their best efforts, her youngest daughter died as a result of her lingering illness and the family was left deep in debt. But, Edelyn still remained active with the loan with no delayed payments.\r\n<p>\r\nYears later, when she could borrow a bigger loan, she decided to venture into a different business activity.  That is when she started her \"Sari-sari,\" or general store business.  With the help of her Dungganon loans, her businesses enabled her to buy and renovate the house they were living in, which she was only renting before, have water connected to it, buy furnishings and appliances, and send her 2 surviving children to college. In the 6 years that she has been a Project Dungganon member, Edelyn can proudly testify that NWTF not only helped her through all the hardships, but also continues with her on her journey as she walks away from poverty. \r\n<p>\r\nFor her 11th loan, Edelyn is borrowing PHP 19,000 to continue expanding her business activities so that she can secure the future of her 2 surviving children and continue to improve the quality of life for her family. \r\n<p>\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the calling of not just of a few, but thousands of women. Through the alleviation program, these women have progressed from earning less than a measly $1 a day, to surpassing the realities beyond their dreams. They have learned to live a life where they can finally be called honorable. This is Project Dungganon.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":378283,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

Florence has been engaged in her business for over 6 years and earns approximately 6,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Florence joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Florence has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from GDMPC. Florence is requesting a new loan of 8,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the fourth loan taken out by Florence from GDMPC.

With two sources of household income, she is able to provide for her three children, who range in age from 3 to 20, and give them a quality education so that they will have a successful future.  Zobeida has not abandoned her goal of organizing her business.  Her focus is on opening a store in another location because she currently operates her business out of her home.  By having a separate location, she will be able to maintain the family peace at home, so she is working hard to achieve this objective.

She is 39 years old.  Marina is the group leader of a 4-member group loan offered by ASKI.  While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nMarina is married and has 2 school-aged children.  To make a living, Marina owns and operates a general store.  While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling a variety of different products in the local community.  Marina has been engaged in her business for over 6 years and earns approximately 3,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Marina joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Marina has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10,000 PHP from ASKI.  This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell.  Marina is requesting a new loan of 12,000 PHP which will be used to purchase new items to expand product offering.  This loan will be the 4th loan taken out by Marina from ASKI.  She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay the tuition fees for her children. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 38 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Later, when she got married, her husband gave her money to set up her own general store, and she has been running her own business for four years. Her store hours begin at 6:00am and end at 9:00pm.

He was born in Magburaka town, Tonkolili District, in northern Sierra Leone. Abdul is married to a businesswoman and the two have four children. Three of his children are in primary school and one is in secondary school. Abdul runs a video center (a cinema with several 19\u201d televisions) where he shows movies and European soccer matches.   People of all ages come to watch Premier League, FA Cup, Carling Cup and European Championship Cup matches.  Once in a while, he\u2019ll also televise the German, Spanish and Italian league games.  He has never received a loan from SMT before, but is now applying for one to help him strengthen his business.\r\n\r\nWith this loan, Abdul will make a great improvement to his operation. Currently, he is using two satellite dishes, but this is not enough. These dishes cannot show all of the above-mentioned matches. Abdul will therefore add some of his own savings to the money from the loan to buy a new satellite dish that can show all of the above-mentioned matches. He will travel to Freetown, about 240 miles round trip, to buy it. \r\n\r\nNot having the third dish has been Abdul\u2019s greatest challenge in his business. Many customers deserted him because of his inability to show all of the matches. But with this loan, and the dish that he\u2019ll be able to buy, he is optimistic that he will be able to regain all of his lost customers and even find some new ones. Many of the youths in town prefer his video center to others because of its convenient location in the center of town. In addition to having a good location, he is young and many youth like patronizing with him because of their similarities. Also, as chairman of the Motorbike Rider\u2019s Association, he is very popular among the many motorbike riders.\r\n\r\nWhen business improves for Abdul, he will be able to take good care of his family, pay school fees, and provide them with more food and clothing.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":238976,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Entertainment","sector":"Entertainment","themes":["Conflict Zones"],"use":"buying a third satellite dish for his video center","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SL","country":"Sierra Leone","town":"Magburaka, Tonkolili","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"8.5 -11.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":57,"posted_date":"2008-12-16T05:20:48Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":675,"lender_count":26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Abdul","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-12-03T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"SLL","disbursal_amount":2000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":222222.22},{"due_date":"2009-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":222222.22},{"due_date":"2009-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":222222.22},{"due_date":"2009-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":222222.22},{"due_date":"2009-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":222222.22},{"due_date":"2009-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":222222.22},{"due_date":"2009-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":222222.22},{"due_date":"2009-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":222222.22},{"due_date":"2009-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":222222.24}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":81,"local_amount":240000,"processed_date":"2009-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-19T09:07:53Z","rounded_local_amount":243243,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14885067},{"amount":144,"local_amount":426666.66,"processed_date":"2009-03-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:44:08Z","rounded_local_amount":432431.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27128909},{"amount":74.99,"local_amount":222222.22,"processed_date":"2009-04-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:10:10Z","rounded_local_amount":225225,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36025698},{"amount":186,"local_amount":551111.12,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T23:53:58Z","rounded_local_amount":558558.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53008502},{"amount":39.01,"local_amount":115555.54,"processed_date":"2009-07-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:22:20Z","rounded_local_amount":117116.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63230844},{"amount":75,"local_amount":222222.22,"processed_date":"2009-08-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:37:24Z","rounded_local_amount":225225,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73662616},{"amount":75,"local_amount":222222.24,"processed_date":"2009-09-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T02:15:43Z","rounded_local_amount":225225.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87102851}],"funded_date":"2008-12-16T17:20:06Z","paid_date":"2009-10-16T02:15:43Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Joe Castrovinci","image":442131}},{"id":83655,"name":"B\u00e9atrice","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"A.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Mrs. C\u1eady has participated in the TYM Fund since 2005. Before she joined the Fund, her family depended upon fishing for their income.  Since joining the Fund, she has used her loans to invest in a business selling bamboo.  This business is now doing rather well and earns the family an income of 3,000,000 VND (172 USD)  per month.  In the next round of lending, she hopes to borrow 20,000,000 VND (1150 USD) to buy more bamboo, which they can sell to residents of the local community.  This will enable Mrs. C\u1eady and her family to increase their income.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Vietnamese by Robert Sides, Kiva

But being a very optimistic person, she considered it as a chance to start a new life. \r\n\r\nWith the sum of 10,000 Kyrgyz soms (KGS), Uulbu began her business of selling linen and belts. She worked hard and managed to buy a flat for her small family. In order to enlarge the assortment of goods, in 2008, Uulbu obtained her first loan of 80,000 KGS from Bai Tushum and Partners. This loan was used as intended and repaid without any delays. \r\n\r\nHer activity started to bring permanent profit and the number of customers increased. This fact lead Uulbu to take her second loan from Bai Tushum and Partners, which was also used to enlarge her business.\r\n\r\nBut in June 2010, when violent clashes caused by a deposed political regime broke out in the city of Osh, Uulbu lost her business, which was robbed and looted. But Uulbu, being an optimistic and hardworking person, didn\u2019t give up and decided to resume her lost business and continue activities. \r\n\r\nFor this very reason, Uulbu is applying for a loan of 135,000 KGS, which she needs to restart her business.

As he did not have the funds he needed to be able to continue with his university education, he started a business selling CDs, cassettes, and DVDs.

She sells clothing items in one of the busiest markets in Ivano-Frankivsk. She owns three vending facilities and has three hired employees who work for her. The inventory she sells is of very high quality. Even though her prices are a little higher than average, Mariya has gained many loyal customers who keep coming back to buy clothes from her.  \r\n<p>\r\nMariya has been in business for 10 years. The twenty-four loans she has received and promptly repaid with Nadiya Ukraine have promoted consistent increase in her sales and profits. Currently, she has around $8,000 of working capital. Her net profit is about $2,000 every month. \r\n<p>\r\nMariya has requested a loan for $1,200 to help open her fourth vending kiosk and expand her trade as a result. Her daughter just had her first baby and Mariya is enjoying her responsibilities as a grandma.

At the same time, the salary is not enough to cover all of the family expenses. In 2005 Gulchar borrowed $500 to add to her own savings of $250 and purchased another milk cow. Since January 2006, prices have doubled and Gulchar applied for a loan of $600 from Normicro to purchase two calves for meat production and expanded her business.

from Dar es Salaam! This is 27 year-old Marim S.. She is married with one 4 year old child. In 2000 Marim established a livestock business. Marim has already received and successfully repaid two loans from SELFINA, and now requires a loan of $875 in order to purchase additional cows and chickens. She thanks you for your support.\r\n\r\nRaising kuku is a popular micro-business in Tanzania, especially amongst SELFINA clients. In fact, if you are a regular lender on kiva.org, you may be tired of reading about kuku. Who or what are \u2018kuku\u2019, you may ask. Kuku means chickens in Swahili, and raising them for sale is popular for a number of reasons. \r\n\r\nFirstly, they require little start-up capital, you can start with one or two and either add to them as you go or wait for them to multiple naturally! Secondly, they require little space, so sometimes you can just let them run around in your garden or compound. Thirdly, while they are growing they produce eggs, which can either be sold to provide a supplementary source of income, or eaten to provide a supplementary source of protein. I\u2019m sure there are hundreds of other reasons why raising kuku is so popular (maybe they are friendlier than other animals? Prettier?), but this is all time and space will allow.\r\n\r\n<b>About SELFINA<\/b><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nSELFINA is engaged in economic empowerment of women in Tanzania, where customs and traditions normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets. Because they lack tangible collateral assets, women are considered not creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low income. \r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through <i><b>Micro Leasing<\/b><\/i> as a practical way to achieve economic and social emancipation of women. SELFINA buys equipment and leases it to women. When a client needs working capital, SELFINA buys equipment from her, extending her a loan, and then leases the same equipment back to her \u2013 a process called \"sale and leaseback\"."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":875,"image":{"id":110521,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To

Her life partner works for himself. Her goal for her business is to always stay active so that the number of customers won\u2019t drop off, since they are crucial to her business. Her hope is that her children will be able to run this business so that in the future they will have some income. Her dreams are to have another business with a variety of products to offer to her customers, and also to live long enough to see this happen.\r\n\r\nFrancisca has a video game business. It is located in her house, at the following address: to the north of the Guadalupe church, 75 varas [unit of distance measurment] to the west. Francisca has had this business for 2 years. This is how she became involved in it--it came about because of the need to deal with the economic situation and because of her dwindling ability to buy basic food items. It was Francisca\u2019s children who thought of the idea. They have Playstations, Mario cars, and other video games. Most of their neighbors have children, so Francisca decided to to buy more video game equipment to start her business in her house. As time has gone by, she has become more well-known. The loan is for working capital to improve the servcies she offers and also to improve the equipment she has so that she can offer the best quality in games. These are expensive and she has to travel to Managua to purchase them.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jennifer Day, Kiva

He lives in his own house, and what he most desires is to be able to afford higher education for his two beloved sons. \r\n\r\nHis life hasn\u2019t been easy: ever since he was very young, he has always tried to work hard and provide for his family the comforts that he never had. He currently works as a bricklayer, and he is much sought after by his neighbours since he has been doing very good work for more than ten years. Enrique enjoys building walls and putting roofs on houses, and he feels that his work contributes to the development of the neighbourhood. For this reason he is planning to start a new venture--laying hardwood flooring, an activity that will help him to earn more money.\r\n\r\nIn his view the most difficult part of his current job is carrying the heavy wooden planks, and his body is now not as strong as it used to be. Enrique is very pleased to have the opportunity to get a loan with Kiva partner, MFP, and he is certain that the will be able to make all his repayments on time. He is a much-admired member of the community bank as he is very responsible and respectful. With the S\/.1000 loan he will buy a floor-polishing machine so that he can begin work on this new activity. \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jane Agg, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":327466,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Construction","sector":"Construction","themes":null,"use":"To buy a polishing machine for hardwood floors","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Puno","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15.833333 -70.033333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-06-04T00:20:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Enrique","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-04-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-29T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":165}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":116.9,"local_amount":334,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:44:40Z","rounded_local_amount":353.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52990663},{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-07-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:46:07Z","rounded_local_amount":176.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63211774},{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-08-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:28:30Z","rounded_local_amount":176.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73641300},{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-09-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:41:51Z","rounded_local_amount":176.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87080738},{"amount":57.75,"local_amount":165,"processed_date":"2009-10-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:16:22Z","rounded_local_amount":174.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96996879}],"funded_date":"2009-06-04T05:57:57Z","paid_date":"2009-11-16T03:16:22Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jane A"}},{"id":116439,"name":"Rosa Argentina","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Rosa argentina Mart\u00ednez S. tiene 39 a\u00f1os de edad.

","en":"Rafaela de los \u00c1ngeles is 41 years old.  Her work is clothing sales.  It has been more than 5 years since she began this ambulatory business.  She began to sell because she was as ingle mother and she had to support her two children.  Because of this she decided to take the initiative to begin selling a variety of clothing.

She lives in her own house with her two children: 12 year-old Karen and 6 year-old Cristian, who are the motivation for all of her efforts.  For Mery, the business of selling clothes has been an activity which has allowed her to obtain the necessary income to maintain her family.  Specifically, she sells polos, which she buys from an important market in her city to bring them to sell at her work, since she also works cleaning a hospital.  What she likes the most about her work is conversing with her customers.  She has been doing this for two years and she considers the most difficult thing is to have to bring the garments to her work, as the bundles weigh a lot.

She earns her living by operating two business ventures:  fish vending and pig fattening. Her husband, Francisco, who is 60 years old, works as a fisherman to earn his living, and also helps in his wife's business activities. They have four children who are between 22 and 27 years old. \r\n\r\nJuliana joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2004 because she wanted something better for her family. With the help of her past 12 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Juliana has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 15,000 PHP helped her earn a monthly profit of about $187, raising the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 13th loan, she is borrowing 15,000 PHP, which she intends to use for additional capital for the fish vending business so that she can continue to save up for the future expansion of her business. Juliana is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She is 28 years old. Geraldine is the group leader of a four-member group loan offered by ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is Geraldine C.'s Group.\r\n\r\nGeraldine is married and has two school-aged children. To make a living, Geraldine owns and operates a specialized retail store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling daily use products such as shampoo, soap and toothpaste in the local community. Geraldine has been engaged in her business for more than six years and earns approximately 4,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Geraldine joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Geraldine has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase new items to expand her product offering. Geraldine is requesting a new loan of 8,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the second loan taken out by Geraldine from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay her children's tuition fees. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 38 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Tajikistan and IMON International\n\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Her experiences in her own life - being an adopted child and unrecognized by most of her family members because her parents were poor - pushed her to soar high and be brave in surmounting the challenges she encounters for her own family. Roberto, Diana's husband understood his wife's emotional struggle because they share a common experience. Both of them belonged to a very poor family and have almost fallen or drifted from the real world because of too much insecurity. However, when they both met and got married they found their strength in each other. Diana felt quite secure having her loving and understanding husband beside her. \r\n\r\nWhen Diana had two children, she gained more strength to fight the battles she is facing - financial, and emotional battles. When they started having their own family, she and her husband had no stable job nor source of income. Life then was so hard for both of them, especially for Diana. When ASHI came to their village Diana's clear vision of tomorrow started to flourish. She saw the bright future for her children waiting ahead of her when she received a loan from ASHI. Since then, Diana and her husband have been venturing into several kinds of business, searching for their success. However, life seemed to be cruel for them, she said, yet giving up was far from her thoughts.\r\n\r\nEventually, Diana found her happiness in life. She was elected as member representative to the Board by ASHI members in Antique, Philippines. Her eldest son graduated from college and was a scholar of a state university. Her second child is in high school and is very active in church. For these things she achieved, Diana was so thankful for the loan she obtained from ASHI because she had the opportunity to enhance the agricultural skills she learned from her husband as well as her commercial skills from being a commerce student when she was in college.\r\n\r\nNow, Diana and her husband are farming three hectares (7.5 acres) of rice field. Rice production (planting of rice) is one of their businesses as well as tricycle (motorcycle with sidecar) for hire. Diana has her own tricycle and her rice production business generates employment in their community during planting season. She hires laborers to work with them in the field.\r\n\r\nAside from her rice production business and tricycle for hire, Diana plans to venture in the buying and selling of rice and also a motorcycle-for-hire business. This loan will be used for these things.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":348570,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To

She is 21 years old. Karen is married. To make a living, Karen owns and operates a specialized retail store. The main source of income for her business comes from selling seafood products, including fish and shrimp, in the local community. Karen has been engaged in her business for over 12 years and earns approximately 10,000 Philippine pesos a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Karen joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Karen has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from GDMPC, a Kiva partner. This previous loan was used to purchase additional inventory and working capital. Karen is requesting a new loan of 7,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This will be the second loan taken out by Karen from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement her family's income. \r\n\r\n<b>About GDMPC:<\/b>\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three unit offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":508887,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish

Since the death of her husband (with whom she had no children) in 2002, she has been living alone in the family of her brother. There, she has set up a little shop selling foodstuffs. She also raises poultry with some thirty hens intended for sale or for her own consumption. The profit from these two activities is divided into four parts: one part goes as her share of costs to her brother's family, two parts go to add to her working capital, and the last part into her savings account with IMCEC. \r\n\r\nWith her profit, she has managed to build her own house that she is intending to rent out after she has made the finishing touches. It is for that reason that she is requesting a loan of 100,000 francs to add to her working capital and thus grow her income.

She was born in Corozal, and she is married and the mother of 5 children, ranging in age from 13 to 19. She lives in Juan Mina, one of the two divisions of the rural area surrounding the Colombian city of Barranquilla, 5 km southwest of the urban center along the Algod\u00f3n highway. It is here that she has operated her business for the past 14 years. Her principal activity is selling locally raised chickens. She also has a restaurant located on the main road. Her work is typical in this area, since there are a number of poulty farms. In her restaurant, her specialty is the delicious and well-known \"sancocho de gallina\" [chicken stew]. She has two freezers to conserve her products, and she has the necessary furniture and equipment for her restaurant. She cooks with wood, which according to her gives better flavor to the food. Her chicken business increases during the Christmas season, and for this reason Isabel needs additional capital to increase her purchases of the product and fulfill the great demand during this season. For this reason, she came to the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation to request a Kiva loan, her first financing with this organization. She will invest it in locally bred chickens, buying them in greater quantity than usual, so she can take advantage of the large number of orders her customers have placed with her.

His very poor parents can\u2019t take care of a large family. He was obliged to stop his studies early at primary school level. Thanks to an uncle who took him as an apprentice tailor, he became a skilful worker and quickly gained experience, and obtained his diploma of tailor embroiderer after four (04) years of apprenticeship. His socio-economical situation did not allow him to quickly be on his own. It took him a long time to get married; today he has three (03) children and has five (05) apprentices in his charge. His life is getting better since he received his first credit of $ 300 which he smoothly paid back. His second credit of $ 550 brought him success and his workshop receives prospects everyday. With his dynamism, perseverance, rigor in the management of his workshop and his well done work, Mr M. is more and more needed, but he doesn\u2019t succeed in satisfying his customers in due time because of the lack of sewing machines. These festive period in which there are increasing demands, constitute a nightmare for him.\r\n\r\nThis credit of $ 850 will help him buy a more performing embroidery machine so that he can be quicker in his activities and mainly improve the quality of his services. The realization of this project will considerably improve his income and his economical and financial potential which will make a change in his social and family environment.\r\n\r\n<p> \r\n\r\nMonsieur M.

Il doit son salut \u00e0 un oncle qui le recueille comme apprenti tailleur. Tr\u00e8s assidu dans ce m\u00e9tier, il gagna rapidement en exp\u00e9rience et obtint son dipl\u00f4me de tailleur brodeur apr\u00e8s quatre (04) ans d\u2019apprentissage. Sa situation socio \u00e9conomique ne lui permettant pas de se prendre rapidement en charge, il mis du temps pour se marier et a aujourd\u2019hui trois (03 enfants et a \u00e0 sa charge cinq (05) apprentis. Sa situation tend \u00e0 s\u2019am\u00e9liorer depuis que Monsieur M. a re\u00e7u son premier cr\u00e9dit de $300 qu\u2019il avait d\u2019ailleurs bien rembours\u00e9. Son second cr\u00e9dit de $550 l\u2019a totalement relanc\u00e9 et son atelier tr\u00e8s fr\u00e9quent\u00e9. Avec son dynamisme, sa pers\u00e9v\u00e9rance, sa rigueur dans la gestion de son atelier et son travail bien fait, Monsieur M. est de plus en plus sollicit\u00e9, mais il n\u2019arrive pas \u00e0 satisfaire sa client\u00e8le \u00e0 temps \u00e0 cause de l\u2019insuffisance des machines.

Desde ni\u00f1o apoyaba en las labores agr\u00edcolas a sus padres, pero cuando form\u00f3 su propia familia empez\u00f3 a sembrar de manera independiente papas, arvejas y ma\u00edz. Para atender sus cultivos con mucha paciencia se levanta a las 4 de la ma\u00f1ana, que es cuando aprovecha en regar o fumigar, para que a las 8 de la ma\u00f1ana s\u00f3lo se dedique a remover y quitar las yerbas de sus cultivos. Cuando sus cosechas est\u00e1n listas las env\u00eda directamente al mercado m\u00e1s importante y grande de la ciudad de Tarma, donde generalmente logra vender sus productos a un buen precio. Por ello, Manuel se siente muy contento con su actividad, ya que trabaja en armon\u00eda con su esposa y todos sus hijos; por eso, para las cosechas no necesita buscar operarios, prefiere pagarles a sus hijos, de ese modo los motiva a que tambi\u00e9n siembren, pues reconoce que gracias a la agricultura los educ\u00f3 y les brindo una econom\u00eda s\u00f3lida.

El dinero que viene solicitando es para la compra de fertilizantes qu\u00edmicos y 24 kilos de  ma\u00edz para su pr\u00f3xima siembra. ","en":"Manuel is 54 years old and lives with his wife in their own home.  They have 6 children and also a 7 year old grandson.  Manuel is known to be a man of good character and an industrious worker.  He has been farming since he was a boy by helping his parents on their property, but when he started a family, he began planting his own crops of potatoes, peas and corn.  Tending to his crops requires much patience.  He wakes up at 4am to begin watering or fumigating.  By 8am, he has moved on to removing weeds.  When his crops have been harvested, he sends them directly to the largest market in the city of Tarma where producers go to get the best price.  Manuel is very pleased with his work and with that of his wife and children.  He does not have to hire workers to harvest crops because he would rather pay his children to do it.  He hopes this will motivate them to start their own farms.  Manuel acknowledges that agriculture has helped educate his children and provided for his family financially.\r\n<p>\r\nThis is his first loan with MFP.   He was able to join because he was invited by a neighbor, so he is very grateful.  He is committed to following the group rules and making his payments on time.  The money he is requesting will be used to buy chemical fertilizers and 24 kilos of corn for the next planting.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":369057,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Purchase fertilizers and seeds","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-08-15T16:10:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":175,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Manuel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-07-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":175}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":175,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-24T09:51:45Z","rounded_local_amount":514.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734230}],"funded_date":"2009-08-15T18:28:30Z","paid_date":"2010-01-24T09:51:45Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ronan Reodica","image":498323}},{"id":132889,"name":"Emma","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Emma C. is 37 years old CEVI client from Talibon Bohol.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":388503,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To purchase bulk crops","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbeya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.9 33.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-09-15T18:20:17Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":700,"lender_count":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Judy ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":900000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2009-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2010-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2010-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":150000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":116.67},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":116.66},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":116.67},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":116.67},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.66},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":116.67,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2009-10-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T06:32:39Z","rounded_local_amount":152189.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97023052},{"amount":116.66,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:44:56Z","rounded_local_amount":152189.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103868293},{"amount":116.67,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2009-12-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T16:47:04Z","rounded_local_amount":152189.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110757489},{"amount":116.67,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2010-01-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:34:52Z","rounded_local_amount":152189.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118146583},{"amount":116.66,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T11:16:28Z","rounded_local_amount":152189.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123984728},{"amount":116.67,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2010-03-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-10T13:01:31Z","rounded_local_amount":152189.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":129015401}],"funded_date":"2009-09-16T00:36:30Z","paid_date":"2010-12-10T13:01:31Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Emina Tudakovic","image":825486}},{"id":141112,"name":"Irene","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Irene S. is from the village of Bato.

While both members of the group receive an individual loan, they are both responsible for paying back the loan of their fellow group member if they are delinquent or default. The official name of this borrowing group is V\u1ecdng Nguy\u1ec7t 3 - Nh\u00f3m 03 (3).\r\n<br>T. is married and has three adult-aged children. To make a living, T. owns and operates a tailoring business. The main source of income for the business comes from providing general alteration and tailoring services to local community members. T. has been engaged in this business for over 15 years and earns approximately 2,000,000 VND a month from these activities.\r\n<br>In 2008, T. joined SEDA to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 4,256,000 VND from SEDA. This loan was used to purchase additional fabrics and materials. She is now requesting a new loan of 5,152,000 VND, which will also be used to purchase additional fabrics and materials. The loan will be her third from SEDA.  T. plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve her family's general living conditions.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>About the other borrower in the group<\/b><br>\r\n1.

SPBD's loans are Siupolu's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Siupolu C. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.6 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.7 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2.3 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress.  The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation.  A higher number represents a higher score.  For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.  \r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.  \r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD
