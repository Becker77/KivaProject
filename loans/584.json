This is a typical village that maintains all of its pure Andean culture, and the entire community supports each other during the planting and harvest seasons, caring for children and animals. This is a beautiful place where Quechua is spoken, and it's located in the department of Cusco. Purificacion is 25 years old, single and has a 6-year-old son. She works in agriculture and also in handicrafts, buying textiles in Cusco and then taking them to a village called Corao to sell to tourists who often stop while passing in their car. She also takes items to Tambomachay, an archaeological center, and offers the textiles when the workers are free. She is requesting the loan to invest in the purchase of textiles and more crafts in Cusco and then go up and sell them. Purificacion is both mother and father to her young son, who is the motivation for her to work arduously in order to give him everything he needs. She is grateful and values the loan through this medium, and she promises to be disciplined in her payments, as she has been with her past loans."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":875284,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"to purchase crafts in Cusco and go up to Tambomachay to sell them.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Yuncaypata - Cusco - Cusco - Cusco","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":119,"posted_date":"2011-09-22T03:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Purificacion","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-09-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":226.59},{"due_date":"2011-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":235.59},{"due_date":"2011-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":244.93},{"due_date":"2012-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":254.64},{"due_date":"2012-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":264.74},{"due_date":"2012-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":273.51}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.08},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":86.39},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":89.8},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":93.37},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.07},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100.29}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":83.08,"local_amount":226.59,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T09:27:08Z","rounded_local_amount":226.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238552303},{"amount":86.39,"local_amount":235.59,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:20:11Z","rounded_local_amount":236,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244511110},{"amount":89.8,"local_amount":244.93,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T09:26:36Z","rounded_local_amount":245.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250718561},{"amount":93.37,"local_amount":254.64,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T09:38:13Z","rounded_local_amount":255.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257121109},{"amount":97.07,"local_amount":264.74,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T08:39:14Z","rounded_local_amount":265.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263246108},{"amount":100.29,"local_amount":273.51,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T08:35:32Z","rounded_local_amount":273.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":269971056}],"funded_date":"2011-09-22T08:02:04Z","paid_date":"2012-04-15T08:35:32Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Marty Greenstein","image":null}},{"id":342009,"name":"Aly","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"L'emprunteur est un soudeur m\u00e9tallique qui est employ\u00e9 dans un atelier de soudure.Il fait n\u00e9anmoins tr\u00e9s souvent de la consultance pour des particuliers.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

In the future, she would like to have a mini-market so that she can satisfy all her customer's needs.  \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ann Achilli, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":584787,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To purchase rice, drinks and candy for her store","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Guayaquil (Guasmo)","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":147,"posted_date":"2010-08-17T18:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Martha Isabel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-07-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":79.1},{"due_date":"2010-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":92.09},{"due_date":"2010-11-06T07:00:00Z","amount":93.54},{"due_date":"2010-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":96.26},{"due_date":"2011-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":97.94},{"due_date":"2011-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":100.21},{"due_date":"2011-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":103.52},{"due_date":"2011-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":104.93},{"due_date":"2011-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":107.54},{"due_date":"2011-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":124.87}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.1},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":92.09},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":93.54},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":96.26},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":97.94},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100.21},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":103.52},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.93},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":107.54},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":124.87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":79,"local_amount":79,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:06:38Z","rounded_local_amount":79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172112309},{"amount":92.19,"local_amount":92.19,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T13:55:26Z","rounded_local_amount":92.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177405718},{"amount":93.54,"local_amount":93.54,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T14:05:50Z","rounded_local_amount":93.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182544186},{"amount":96.26,"local_amount":96.26,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T13:08:59Z","rounded_local_amount":96.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188680943},{"amount":97.94,"local_amount":97.94,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T01:46:33Z","rounded_local_amount":97.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191379273},{"amount":100.21,"local_amount":100.21,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T08:13:59Z","rounded_local_amount":100.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195797257},{"amount":103.52,"local_amount":103.52,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T10:23:27Z","rounded_local_amount":103.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201239427},{"amount":104.93,"local_amount":104.93,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T10:20:05Z","rounded_local_amount":104.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206105877},{"amount":107.54,"local_amount":107.54,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-20T07:52:33Z","rounded_local_amount":107.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211862643},{"amount":124.87,"local_amount":124.87,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-21T07:49:21Z","rounded_local_amount":124.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216459136}],"funded_date":"2010-08-18T00:08:24Z","paid_date":"2011-07-21T07:49:21Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":227262,"name":"Virginia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Virginia E. is from the village of Nungnungan, Cauayan City, Isabela.

Es el primer cr\u00e9dito con MFP y agradece la oportunidad que le dio el banco comunal al que ahora pertenece, ya que seg\u00fan afirma, tiene el apoyo que le faltaba para lograr sus objetivos. Es por ello que ya ha pensado invertir el cr\u00e9dito en la compra de varios sacos de abono org\u00e1nico entre potasio y guano (excrement\u00f3 de animales), los que esparcir\u00e1 en sus sembr\u00edos de caf\u00e9 y pl\u00e1tano. \n\n","en":"Cristian is 24 years old.  He is a single and hard-working man who, together with his mom, works hard to get ahead in life.  He and his mother live in their own home in the community of Sanchirio (central Peruvian jungle).  At his young age, Cristian has many ambitions.  He started farming 4 years ago since he tells us that his parents had taught him farming techniques since he was a boy.  He recently acquired his own plot of land where he grows bananas and coffee.  He has good harvests since the money that he used to invest in renting his land is now invested in caring for his crops, looking after them constantly.  For this reason the cooperative in his community buys his coffee beans for a good price.  However, Cristian's aspirations are to study the use of heavy machinery.\n\nThis is Cristian's first loan with MFP and he is grateful for the opportunity which his community bank has give him since he says that he now has the support to achieve his goals that he was previously lacking.  He plans to invest his loan in buying several sacks of organic fertilizer - potassium and guano (animal excrement) which he will spread on his coffee and banana crops."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":650261,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy sacks of organic fertilizer","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Chanchamayo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.05 -75.316667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:27Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Cristian ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-11-11T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":375}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":375,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:47:51Z","rounded_local_amount":1053.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232850451}],"funded_date":"2010-12-04T04:31:26Z","paid_date":"2011-10-15T09:47:51Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Oxnard","image":null}},{"id":255951,"name":"Farida","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Farida N. lives in the Kawala neighborhood of Kampala, Uganda.

Aykaz's sons live together with their families separately from the parents.  Aykaz finished a Sevan professional technical college.  He spent twenty years working as a mechanic in the agricultural collective and then started his own farm in 1993.  Aykaz's wife helps him, and thanks to their joint efforts, they breed cows, sheep, pigs and chickens.  Aykaz also owns a small plot of land, where he grows feed for his domestic animals and buys the remaining feed from his neighbors.  He sells his agricultural products (milk products, beef, lamb, pork, eggs and poultry) at the Razdanskiy city market and uses resulting profits to support his family.  Aykaz needs a loan in the sum of 500,000 dram for the purchase needed animal feed and to repair his lawn mower.  He and his wife intend to use the obtained income to finish the construction of their house."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1375,"image":{"id":855059,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

She owns some crop fields that both her parents and her community have given her. <p>\r\nOn these fields, she cultivates bananas, coffee, manioc, taro, and corn. Because of the variety of produce that she grows, she has been able to negotiate her products every month, thus helping her support, feed, and educate her youngest children. <p>\r\nSilverio and the older children help out with the farming and selling of their produce, which they transport from their district to the city of La Merced, where well-known buyers and regional coffee company representatives come together. \"There is never a shortage of work in my community. Sometimes my husband, my children, and I work as day laborers on other fields,\" she mentions. Catalina hopes to open a business in her house, where she plans to sell basic need items. She also hopes to build more rooms in her home, but in order to do this, she must invest and continue working. With your support, she will be able to obtain her fifth loan from MFP, which is why she commits to being punctual in making her repayments. Additionally, she states that she feels happy with her communal bank because of the incentives for progress that group work generates. She will invest 800.00 PEN of this loan in purchasing fertilizer.

When she herself is away from the store, either buying more goods or due to personal reasons, her mother takes care of the store for her. Her mother also helps her expand this business and when Bisaboat was short on money her mother helped solve her financial problems.

Nurjamal and her family  lives in Karabalta.  Nurjamal's husband works in construction.   During the winter time, building everywhere stops. However, Nurjamal's husband makes every possible effort to find work during this hard time. Nurjamal and her husband are raising three children. The older son is fourteen, the daughter is twelve and the younger son is three. As soon as the two older children started to school, Nurjamal began to think of  finding an additional source of income. Her parents helped her with this.  Six years ago they bought a cow and Nurjamal has started to work in animal husbandry and to sell milk. Since then she has managed to increase her herd. Her husband, despite working hard, always helps Nurjamal to look after the cattle. Nurjamal has a stable monthly income from the sale of milk at a rate of two thousand four hundred som ($56). She already began to think of diversification. Now she wishes to start raising goats. In order to do this, Nurjamal needs funds that she does not currently have.  Therefore, she has applied for a loan.  Nurjamal is certain that in the future, her work will allow her to buy a house.  \r\n\r\nNurzhamal's group includes the following participants:\r\n\r\nAkylai is forty years old.

She also raises cattle and sells milk. Cattle cultivation has been passed down to her in her family.   Jibek has applied for a loan to buy a cow and to sell more milk.\r\n\r\nErkayim is thirty-seven years old. She is divorced. Erkayim has one son. To support herself and her son, Erkayim works in animal husbandry and sells milk. She manages to earn six thousand som a month, and her parents help out with the household.

Monthly, she is able to earn an average of 10,000 Philippines pesos (Php).\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operation of her business, she is requesting a Php 50,000 loan. She intends to use this money to purchase more products for her store, all the more now that the Christmas season is fast approaching. She plans to take this opportunity to drive her business toward more profitability.\r\n\r\nMary Grace's life is never without challenges, both in her business and personal life. Nonetheless, she stays focused on the opportunities that lie ahead, and not on the failures of yesterday or the worries of today.\r\n\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

She is asking for a loan to buy flour, sugar, butter, eggs, vanilla, cinnamon and firewood with which to make her sweet bread and pastries (called shells and kisses) and white bread rolls. She started her business 35 years ago and with the savings from the business bought the ingredients. She used to work with her aunt and watched her make the bread and learned how to do the same. The business is important because with it they never lack for food. She makes bread every 8 days. On Thursdays and Sundays her daughters help her make the bread. She goes to town to sell her products as she has customers that date back years and know the days she sells on. She sells her products that gives her the money to buy food for her grandchildren. She uses the profit to pay off debts, reinvest and for food. Her dreams and hopes are to live well, quiet and happy with her family and also wishes the best for her children. The members of the group want to thank Kiva and the Fundacion Realidad: \"Thank you for the loans; we are grateful to you.

Emily is married and has five children. She is the chairperson of her constituency\u2019s development committee. She is also engaged in farming.

Emily is excited about beekeeping as it will earn her some income from the sale of honey.\r\n\r\nThis is Emily\u2019s first loan with Honey Care and she plans to use the proceeds from her beehives to provide for her family\u2019s needs. Emily\u2019s hope for the future is to live a good life.\r\n\r\nKitale is located in the Trans-Nzoia district of western Kenya. Originally dominated by English settlers in the early 20th century, the region\u2019s farmland was redistributed after independence.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Although she's the owner of a combi (van-like vehicle used in public transportation of passengers) she doesn't shrink back from working as fare collector.  She has placed her combi with a transportation company which provides urban transportation along the streets where she lives.  Her charisma and pleasant disposition has made her one of the company's most recognized fare collectors which, in turn, has caused her to have more passengers than any other vehicle.  What she likes best about her work is that, owning her own combi, she can sometimes actually drive it herself.  She has been in this line of work for 10 years and she considers the most difficult part of it having to stand alongside the door all day in the cold draft that comes in from the street.  For the future, Gladys hopes to save enough money to buy a new combi thereby improving her income.  This is her fourth loan with MFP and, as she did with her former loans, she aims to repay this one on time and without any difficulties.  She is highly respected in her communal bank because she is the most active and committed member.

C., 43, lives in the Salvadoran \"departamento\" of Usulutan.  Although she is married and has two children--16- and 14-years old, respectively--she lives only with her younger child because her husband and older child are in the United States.  Carmen has a tortilla business that she has operated for more than 2 years.  The business is reasonably profitable because tortillas are a basic ingredient of the Salvadoran diet and, consequently, much in demand.  Carmen is deliberate and hard-working.  Even thought she receives help from her husband, she wants a steady, stable income of her own so that she can better support herself and her daughter.

Violeta is 41-years old single and supports her family by operating two business ventures:  general store and personal collection businesses.  She lives in Toledo City, Cebu. Ma. Violeta joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2003 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 14 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Ma. Violeta has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 15,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 7,300, uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 15th loan, she is borrowing PHP 15,000, which she intends to buy stocks for the general store so that she could continue to save up for the future improvement of her business. Ma. Violeta is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. About NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams.

With the help of her past three loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Lucena has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 10,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 5,500, uplifting the family's standard of living.

He has been running this business for ten years and has managed to give employment to one person. His motorcycle business is profitable and his major challenge is weather changes: during the rainy seasons, the roads become impassable and people prefer to use vans. However he works very hard to keep his business doing well. He is using his loan of Kes 80,000 to buy clothes and handbags to boost his clothing sales business.

Only two are below 15 years of age and some are in school. She lives in Bamenda, Northwest region of Cameroon.\r\n\r\nHer major challenges in life have been the difficulty of her children dropping out of school and  some being locked up in a police cell and inadequate capital to start up a business for herself before joining GHAPE. She has also suffered greatly from ill health. Given a loan she plans to buy Irish potatoes, cocoyams, yellow yams and local plums. She knows her business is going to succeed because she has acquired some basic training on finance management and marketing techniques from GHAPE and she has chosen to diversify business by also investing some of her capital in her farm and also, she has got support and hence success. The loan if granted will enable her to sell in her neighborhood at cheaper prices. She joined GHAPE in 2008, since then she has successfully borrowed and repaid loans two times.\r\n\r\nShe will plough back some of her profit into her business and use part to care for her family. She also will use the proceeds to pay her house rent. Her children\u2019s school needs will be taken care of. She prefers GHAPE because of the training she frequently receives and the low cost in obtaining and paying back a loan.\r\n\r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon.  GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach.

Catherine has already received and successfully repaid one loan from SELFINA, and has applied for a new loan to buy additional stocks of rice and maize in bulk. She thanks you for your support. <P>SELFINA is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility, as a practical way to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women.<P>SELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed not-creditworthy by financial institutions as they lack tangible collateral assets. This leads to poor financial support hence poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.<P>SELFINA buys and leases equipment to women.

San Andr\u00e9s is situated in the Atitl\u00e1n region. The people of this beautiful place are fortunate enough to wake up every day and admire the beauty of Atitl\u00e1n Lake. San Andr\u00e9s is also known for being a traditional town that conserves its values, but is also developing. \r\n<p> The members of Trixana are a group of women who are learning to manage credit. This is the second loan that they have requested. They are asking for this loan for many reasons. First, this is the first time that they have access to a loan so easily; for them to qualify, it is enough that they are a group of women, that they agree to stick together to repay the loan, and that they have a photocopy of a government-issued identity document. Second, they are requesting another loan because they benefitted from the first one. They said that thanks to the previous loan, they were able to buy more raw materials, which permitted them to make more profits.\r\n<p> Apparently in the micro-finances, especially with new clients, being able to buy a more merchandise and generating more profits is something that rarely happens. Because of this, their success is remarkable. \r\n<p> The members of Trixana work in different industries. Most of the women work in the textiles industry; they knit traditional blouses called \u201chuililes.\u201d Also, two women have a tortilla shop. This business has profits because tortillas have an inelastic demand in rural Guatemala. There are also women that work in a variety of businesses, such as cultivating flowers and corn, selling beans and rice, and looking after a store. A plot of land, that 8 years ago cost Q250.00 to rent, now costs Q800.00, according to Alicia C..\r\n<p> Am\u00e9rica C. said that she likes working with The Friendship Bridge because of the training that she receives, especially that of her rights as a woman. Now, thanks to this training, she knows her rights as a woman. We feel very satisfied with this. Your support will contribute enormously with the development of this Guatemalan town.\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Spanish by A. Shah, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\n<P>Las mujeres que conforman el grupo Trixana en su mayor\u00eda provienen de un bello pueblo llamado San Andr\u00e9s Semetabaj. San Andres queda en la regi\u00f3n de Atitl\u00e1n. Los pobladores de este bello lugar tienen la fortuna de levantarse todos los d\u00edas y admirar la belleza del lago Atitl\u00e1n. San Andr\u00e9s tambi\u00e9n es conocido por ser un pueblo tradicional que conserva sus valores pero que tambi\u00e9n est\u00e1 desarrollando.       \r\n\r\n<P>Las Trixanas son un grupo de mujeres que est\u00e1 aprendiendo a manejar el cr\u00e9dito. Este cr\u00e9dito que van a solicitar es el segundo en su vida. Ellas est\u00e1n solicitando este cr\u00e9dito por muchas razones: primero, es la primera vez que tienen acceso a un pr\u00e9stamo tan f\u00e1cil, solo basta un grupo de mujeres, una garant\u00eda solidaria y una fotocopia del documento nacional de identidad. Segundo, porque les fue bien en su cr\u00e9dito anterior. Ellas comentaron que gracias al pr\u00e9stamo anterior fueron capaces de comprar una mayor cantidad de materia prima lo cual les permiti\u00f3 generar m\u00e1s ganancias. \r\n\r\n<P>Al parecer en las micro finanzas, especialmente con clientes nuevas, lograr poder comprar un poco m\u00e1s de mercader\u00eda y generar un poco m\u00e1s de ganancias es un evento que las clientes nunca esperaron lograr. Es por eso, en parte, porque las microfinanzas es un \u00e9xito alrededor del mundo.\r\n\r\n<P>Las Trixanas trabajan en distintas industrias. En su mayor\u00eda las mujeres trabajan en el \u00e1rea textil, ellas tejen blusas tradicionales llamadas huipiles. Luego, dos mujeres tienen una tortiller\u00eda. Este negocio no tiene pierde, ya que las tortillas tiene una demanda inel\u00e1stica en el \u00e1rea rural de Guatemala. Luego, hay mujeres que trabajan en una variedad de negocios como el cultivo de flores, ma\u00edz, venta de frijol y ma\u00edz y atienden una tienda. Hace ocho a\u00f1os alquilar cinco cuerdas de tierra (25m x 25m) costaba Q250.00 el d\u00eda de hoy alquilar la misma cantidad de tierras cuesta Q800.00 seg\u00fan comentaba Alicia C.. \r\n\r\n<P>Am\u00e9rica C. coment\u00f3 que le gustaba trabajar con The Friendship Bridge por las capacitaciones que recib\u00eda, especialmente la de los derechos de la mujer. Ahora, gracias a estas capacitaciones, ella est\u00e1 segura de sus derechos como mujer. Nosotros como instituci\u00f3n nos sentimos muy satisfechos con esto y usted gracias a su apoyo van a contribuir enormemente con el desarrollo del pueblo Guatemalteco."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3275,"image":{"id":185968,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Textiles","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"To

She is separated and lives in her own home with her eldest son called Jos\u00e9 (she has 6 children in all).  She also lives with her 13 year-old grandson Jeremy who is her treasure.  This enterprising mother, through a lot of hard work, set up a small grocery store and made it prosper.  She also bought a car, a tool with which she has managed to get her children ahead in life.  Her children are now good, hard-working people.  However, Jes\u00fas was sick for a long time and, as a result, her store gradually failed.  She only had her car left and her son used it.\n\nFor approximately 7 years, Jes\u00fas has been managing the profits that she receives from offering a transport service.  She recently managed to renew her car.  She is convinced that if she continues to work and look after her health, in the future she will be able to re-open her store which she likes so much and she wishes for this \"in spite of the fact that it is very enslaving\".\n\nAt the moment, Jes\u00fas' main priority is to have her car serviced so that her son can continue to work without difficulty. She has set an example as the leader of her community bank during this time.  Her fellow members like her a lot for the support she has provided.\n\nJes\u00fas will use the loan she is requesting to have her car serviced so that her son can continue working and making good profits."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":729104,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Transportation","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"to have her car serviced","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-03-14T22:40:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":725,"lender_count":29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jesus ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-03-10T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":293.33},{"due_date":"2011-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":312.64},{"due_date":"2011-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":324.59},{"due_date":"2011-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":341.33},{"due_date":"2011-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":355.57},{"due_date":"2011-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":372.54}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.33},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":113.33},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":117.67},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":123.73},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.89},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":135.05}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":106.33,"local_amount":293.33,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:32:56Z","rounded_local_amount":294.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206196348},{"amount":113.33,"local_amount":312.64,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:42:03Z","rounded_local_amount":313.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211270026},{"amount":117.67,"local_amount":324.59,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:32:11Z","rounded_local_amount":325.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216550042},{"amount":157.7,"local_amount":435.03,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T09:12:49Z","rounded_local_amount":436.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221718722},{"amount":134.3,"local_amount":370.48,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-17T08:14:05Z","rounded_local_amount":371.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227350160},{"amount":95.67,"local_amount":263.93,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:47:56Z","rounded_local_amount":264.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232850669}],"funded_date":"2011-03-17T06:37:13Z","paid_date":"2011-10-15T09:47:56Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Oxnard","image":null}},{"id":284682,"name":"Lindi Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mwanaid A., who is married with three children, has been a food vendor for 9 years.

Together they have been able to succeed on behalf of their children and provide them an education.  At the moment, only one child lives with them in their home in the village of Patay.  Through effort and dedication, Yolanda and her husband formed a family that gives them great pride.  Farming has been her main business activity for the past 20 years and has made it possible for her to pay for her children\u2019s higher education.  Her children visit her frequently and she is happy to have the love of her grandchildren who she spoils.  Yolanda\u2019s main crops are gladiola flowers, peas, and potatoes.  She provides her crops frequent care and fertilization because she knows this attention will result in good sales at the end of each harvest.  Yolanda sells her crops at the wholesale market in Tarma.  Depending on the quality of her crops, she will even take them to Lima where she can get a better price.  She planted gladiolas and peas early and they will soon be ready to harvest.  \r\n<p>\r\nYolanda is a member of the Communal Bank \u201cPicaflores de Patay\u201d and is receiving her fifth loan from MFP.

While he recovered, he was thinking about how he could provide for his family and a friend invited him to a fishing practice. He did not have any resources to practice this sport, so he started to manufacture his own nets. First he learned to fish and when he saw that his work was excellent and much stronger, his friends began to become interested and they wanted to buy from him. Through this, he found that he could do it as a business. At this moment he has 8 years of experience in this business and he sells his products to both friends, and also any sports stores that are interested in buying from him.

which has a favorable climate and where the cultivation of these crops is an established tradition. He works the fields with the support of his wife, who is also dedicated to the production. This couple has been perfecting and modernizing their production processes. The maintenance of the land has a high cost, due to the attention that must be given to the plants in each phase of the process, such as manually weeding and using organic fertilizer and natural supplements for the control of diseases. These give better yields to their crops, since they prevent the soil from deteriorating so much, provide better conditions for cultivation at planting time and improve the quality of the crop, increasing its value. Organic products currently obtain better prices in the market. Dilovar requests a loan for the purchase of supplies for his crops, such as seeds, fertilizer, fuels and lubricants. He will use part of the loan to pay wages to the hired workers. The loan will greatly improve Dilovar\u2019s income and his family's living conditions.  \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International:\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road, the end of Alexander the Great's rule, and its famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Tajikistan. Her hope was to improve the standard of living for her family and to provide education to her two children. Over the past decade, Husniobod has successfully developed her own clothing business with the support of microfinance loans through IMON International. A committed and hardworking businesswoman, Husniobod has successfully repaid each loan. With the profits from her business, Husniobod has supported not only the education of her daughters, but also her aging parents. Currently, Husniobod is seeking a loan of 8000 Somoni to expand her inventory and increase the variety of products for sale. With the additional profits, Husniobod plans to continue expanding her business and supporting her family. \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Jair prepared and sold simple products, but through hard work and discipline, his business grew rapidly.  For this reason, he had to move to a large location in a recognized area.  He had great expectations, so he acquired an oven and a larger hot dog cart so that he could become established and now he is well-known.  What stands out most about Jair is the great support he has received from his family and he expects it will remain that way.  He works with his brother and his goal is to continue supporting his parents and one day start his own family.  \r\n\r\nThis is his first loan with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  He will invest the proceeds in supplies and fixed assets such as a chicken roaster, a hot dog cart with a canopy, and a chicken warming compartment.

Fid\u00e8le was born in Gatsibo, the former province of Kibuye, which is now the district of Karongi, a western province. He is 35 years old, married with two children who are 5\u00bd and 3\u00bd years old. He began as a butcher, but later became a motorcycle taxi driver, which he has been doing for 3 years.  Because he is thrifty and was able to save money, he became owner of the motorcycle which he had borrowed.  He has been a client of ACB since June of 2008, and has already repaid a loan.  He has requested this loan to pay the tuition of his wife, who is in her second year at university. In the future, he plans to sit for the test to obtain a Category D drivers license for a minibus taxi, then borrow enough to purchase a minibus which he would operate himself.  Long term, this would enable him to increase his income and become financially independent.  Theconditions of his life would be improved, and he would realize his dreams.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Linda Koza, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":560495,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Primary\/secondary school costs","sector":"Education","themes":null,"use":"Pay tuition for his wife","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"RW","country":"Rwanda","town":"Nyarugenge","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 30","type":"point"}},"partner_id":170,"posted_date":"2010-06-26T04:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Fid\u00e9le","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-06-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"RWF","disbursal_amount":200000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":66667},{"due_date":"2010-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":66667},{"due_date":"2010-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":66666}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.67},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.66},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":145.83,"local_amount":83334,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T09:15:56Z","rounded_local_amount":84729.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159577533},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T09:27:27Z","rounded_local_amount":50837.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166788087},{"amount":116.67,"local_amount":66666,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T09:31:23Z","rounded_local_amount":67782.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172057557}],"funded_date":"2010-06-26T09:43:31Z","paid_date":"2010-10-15T09:31:23Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Koza","image":249316}},{"id":215035,"name":"Virgie","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Virgie D.

Su meta es tener un gabinete de belleza. \n\n","en":"Martha C. is a member of El Aguacate (Avocado) community bank and lives in the community of the same name in the city of Cuenca. This city has a beautiful culture and tradition and is known for its great variety of gastronomy as well as having four rivers running through it. Martha works alongside her husband at their jewelry shop, an activity they have been doing for a number of years. She also makes a living selling pigs, a business she learned from her parents in which she now has a lot of experience. She enjoys the job because it earns income quickly, but the problem is it takes a lot of capital to buy the pigs at the start. Martha is 33 years old and her husband is 37. They have two children, ages 8 and 2. They don't own a home but live in a family member's home independently. Martha has been a member of her community bank for a year and four months and enjoys the loans since they are quick and don't have a lot of red tape. She plans on using half of the loan for her jewelry business and the other half to buy pigs. Her goal is to have a beauty shop.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":900,"image":{"id":650376,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Jewelry","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Purchase jewelry and pigs","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Cuenca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:28Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":900,"lender_count":31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Martha Braulia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-11-17T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":880,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":88},{"due_date":"2010-12-29T08:00:00Z","amount":88},{"due_date":"2011-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":88},{"due_date":"2011-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":88},{"due_date":"2011-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":88},{"due_date":"2011-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":88},{"due_date":"2011-03-09T08:00:00Z","amount":88},{"due_date":"2011-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":88},{"due_date":"2011-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":88},{"due_date":"2011-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":88}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":90},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":90},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":90},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":90},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":180,"local_amount":176,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T13:10:49Z","rounded_local_amount":180,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188683357},{"amount":180,"local_amount":176,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T03:33:25Z","rounded_local_amount":180,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191422481},{"amount":180,"local_amount":176,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:39:42Z","rounded_local_amount":180,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195841250},{"amount":180,"local_amount":176,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:03:07Z","rounded_local_amount":180,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201283634},{"amount":180,"local_amount":176,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:00:18Z","rounded_local_amount":180,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206151585}],"funded_date":"2010-12-18T10:42:54Z","paid_date":"2011-05-15T11:00:18Z","journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Marty Greenstein","image":null}},{"id":256015,"name":"Virginia Ester","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Do\u00f1a Virginia, resiD. en Usulut\u00e1n, vive con sus hijos y su esposo, tiene 45 a\u00f1os D. edad, se dedica a la venta D. tablilla, tamales y meriendas, este negocio lo inicio hace 8 a\u00f1os con la ayuda D. sus hijos, pero por el momento quiere invertir y no cuenta con ahorros para poder realizar las compras necesarias D. materiales para la preparaci\u00f3n D. sus productos.\nElla solicita un pr\u00e9stamo para la compra D. ma\u00edz, condimentos, cacao y az\u00facar, as\u00ed como productos para prepara las meriendas, este pr\u00e9stamo le ayudara a realizar la compra y a fortalecer el negocio para producir m\u00e1s e incrementar las ventas.\nTiene como prop\u00f3sito administrar bien los fondos del pr\u00e9stamo haciendo una buena inversi\u00f3n, pagar puntualmente y seguir creciendo en busca D. un mejor futuro.\n","en":"Do\u00f1a Virginia lives in Usulut\u00e1n with her children and husband.

She has a sales post in Puc\u00f3n, which her daughters, ages 19 and 12, tend to. Her husband also helps when he has free days from his work as a public transportation driver. Ximena's dream is to have a sales post in Talcahuano and in this way become more independent. Her motivation to continue with the business is to finance her daughter's higher education since she is studying at an institute. Kiva partner Fondo Esperanza has provided Ximena and her business a lot of support, and she has been touched by her good treatment, the friendship and the responsibility.
