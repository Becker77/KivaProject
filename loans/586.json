The official name of this borrowing group is Emerson L..\r\n\r\nEmerson is single. To make a living, Emerson owns and operates a farming business, planting and harvesting rice for sale. Emerson has been engaged in her business for over ten years and earns approximately $175 a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Emerson joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Emerson is requesting a loan of 15,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional seeds, seedlings and young crops to raise. This will be her 1st loan from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to financially support immediate members of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful micro-finance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisher folks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She is married to Raymond HOUESSOU, a glass cutter, and although they don't have any children of their own yet, she is responsible for one child who is currently attending school. Massouratou has been living with her family in Djeffa for approximately seven years. Together with her husband, they care for the different family expenses. Massouratou did not attend school. To cover her needs and those of her family, she sells wood charcoal and firewood from her home. As a secondary source of income, Massouratou also sells grains and food products. She purchases her materials in Dantokpa, the international market of Benin, as well as in Ketou, another city in Benin. Massouratou has undertaken this activity for about four years, and has already benefitted from three loans, all of which were reimbursed in a timely manner. Massouratou would like to continue to increase the level of commercial activity and be able to better respond to the requests from her customers.

Gracias al esfuerzo de mi familia he podido salir adelante con este negocio ya que en estos momentos es bastante dificil encontrar trabajo y hay que buscar algo para ayudar a la familia."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":17966,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"To purchase various clothing articles for men, women and children.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"Comayaguela","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15.133333 -86.383333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":5,"posted_date":"2007-03-09T00:10:59Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jose Gustavo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-03-26T17:36:14Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":400,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2007-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2007-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2007-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2007-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2007-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":66.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2007-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2007-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2007-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":66.65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":67,"local_amount":67,"processed_date":"2007-04-12T15:43:39Z","settlement_date":"2007-09-13T16:25:29Z","rounded_local_amount":67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":12810},{"amount":67,"local_amount":67,"processed_date":"2007-05-13T05:52:24Z","settlement_date":"2007-09-13T16:25:29Z","rounded_local_amount":67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":16045},{"amount":67,"local_amount":67,"processed_date":"2007-06-12T09:15:05Z","settlement_date":"2007-09-13T16:25:29Z","rounded_local_amount":67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":22385},{"amount":67,"local_amount":67,"processed_date":"2007-07-12T09:15:06Z","settlement_date":"2007-09-13T16:25:29Z","rounded_local_amount":67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":31056},{"amount":67,"local_amount":67,"processed_date":"2007-08-12T09:15:12Z","settlement_date":"2007-09-13T16:25:29Z","rounded_local_amount":67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":41485},{"amount":65,"local_amount":65,"processed_date":"2007-09-12T09:15:05Z","settlement_date":"2007-09-13T16:25:29Z","rounded_local_amount":65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53290}],"funded_date":"2007-03-12T17:36:14Z","paid_date":"2007-09-12T09:15:05Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":9832,"name":"Tomas","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mr. H. has had his snack bar for 10 years.

The SPBD assistance has already helped Liua develop her talent as an agriculturalist, and now she is asking for a loan of US$300 to purchase agricultural chemicals to increase the volume of banana harvest."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":64610,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Purchase of agricultural chemicals","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"WS","country":"Samoa","town":"Manono","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.833333 -172.083333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":15,"posted_date":"2007-09-12T22:35:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":300,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Liua Isapela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-09-27T00:06:48Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":300,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":16,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":21.43},{"due_date":"2007-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":21.43},{"due_date":"2007-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":21.43},{"due_date":"2008-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":21.43},{"due_date":"2008-02-26T08:00:00Z","amount":21.43},{"due_date":"2008-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":21.43},{"due_date":"2008-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":21.43},{"due_date":"2008-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":21.43},{"due_date":"2008-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":21.43},{"due_date":"2008-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":21.43},{"due_date":"2008-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":21.43},{"due_date":"2008-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":21.43},{"due_date":"2008-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":21.43},{"due_date":"2008-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":21.41}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":21.43},{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":21.43},{"due_date":"2008-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":21.43},{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":21.43},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":21.43},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":21.43},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":21.43},{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":21.43},{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":21.43},{"due_date":"2008-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":21.43},{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":21.43},{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":21.43},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":21.43},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":21.41}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":22,"local_amount":22,"processed_date":"2007-11-08T21:58:09Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-28T23:04:32Z","rounded_local_amount":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":78506},{"amount":22,"local_amount":22,"processed_date":"2007-12-11T01:12:45Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-28T23:08:54Z","rounded_local_amount":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":94883},{"amount":22,"local_amount":22,"processed_date":"2008-01-31T04:24:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-28T23:13:26Z","rounded_local_amount":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":124819},{"amount":22,"local_amount":22,"processed_date":"2008-03-03T22:39:18Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-28T23:19:23Z","rounded_local_amount":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":148394},{"amount":44,"local_amount":44,"processed_date":"2008-04-13T00:00:50Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-28T23:31:26Z","rounded_local_amount":44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":181058},{"amount":22,"local_amount":22,"processed_date":"2008-05-19T07:12:46Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-28T23:42:07Z","rounded_local_amount":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":213770},{"amount":22,"local_amount":22,"processed_date":"2008-06-24T09:37:15Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-28T23:57:29Z","rounded_local_amount":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":247742},{"amount":44,"local_amount":44,"processed_date":"2008-08-31T07:40:06Z","settlement_date":"2008-09-09T02:28:04Z","rounded_local_amount":44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":311748},{"amount":80,"local_amount":80,"processed_date":"2008-11-26T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T01:23:54Z","rounded_local_amount":80,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5351460}],"funded_date":"2007-09-13T00:06:48Z","paid_date":"2008-12-17T01:24:00Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":22120,"name":"Agbikp\u00e8","description":{"languages":["fr"],"texts":{"fr":"Mrs. Agbikp\u00e8 IDOAGBODJI, 45 years old, is married and the mother of nine (09) children.

Like many others, she needs to generate income through informal employment such as buying goods at wholesale prices from the markets in the country's interior in places such as Oruro,  and reselling them at a profit.   Corina has 3 children who attend school, one of whom will soon finish secondary school.  Right now, they are living in the home of Corina's parents. With the increase in unemployment in the country, Corina's husband had to leave the family to look for work.  While he looked for work in Spain, Corina realized it was her obligation to look for work that could help sustain the family.  In the beginning, her mother allowed her to locate a small shop in her house, but this wasn't sufficient to generate the income needed.   Corina needed to find new opportunities such as her wholesale business.   Corina dreams of being able to increase her income so that she can open her own market.  With the loan, she will purchase merchandise at wholesale prices and then resell it to her customers.

Kalubihan, Brgy. Libertad, Escalante City, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating two business ventures:  a general store and food vending. Her husband Edgardo, who is 44 years old, works as a driver to earn his living and helps in his wife's business activities.  They have six children who are 2 months to 20 years old. Jocelyn joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2005 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 10 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Jocelyn has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 15,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 8,000, uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 11th loan, she is borrowing PHP 15,000, which she intends to use to buy stock for her general store and food vending businesses so that she can continue to pay for her daughter's school tuition. Jocelyn V. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.\n\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She earns her living by operating two business ventures: selling of fruits and a general store businesses. Her husband Antonio P., who is 61 years old, works as a carpenter to earn his living.  They have two children who are 34 and 39 years old. And they have already a job of their own. Cecilia joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2006 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 10 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Cecilia has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 20,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 31,200, uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 11th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 22,000, which she intends to use to pay for more buy stocks of fruits to sell to a market so that she could continue to save up for future family needs. Cecilia is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling daily use products such as shampoo, soap & toothpaste in the local community.

Corazon is requesting a new loan of 23,000 PHP which will be used to purchase new items to expand product offering. This will be the 3rd loan taken out by Corazon from ASKI.

At this time Sri Handayani still lives in Sidakarya Denpasar with her husband Made Lubis and her only child, 9-year old Melly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Indonesian by Aarati Sivasubramanian, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":125,"image":{"id":197609,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To increase working capital","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Badung","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.5 115.333333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":82,"posted_date":"2008-09-19T03:30:34Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":125,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sri Handayani","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-10-03T04:44:16Z","disbursal_currency":"IDR","disbursal_amount":1000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2008-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":12.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":12.5,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2008-11-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-19T20:05:47Z","rounded_local_amount":115673.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5308562},{"amount":12.5,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2008-12-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-22T08:55:01Z","rounded_local_amount":115673.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9925474},{"amount":12.5,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-01-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T11:40:38Z","rounded_local_amount":115673.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14849785},{"amount":12.5,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-02-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-18T08:03:08Z","rounded_local_amount":115673.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20389204},{"amount":12.5,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-03-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T17:44:48Z","rounded_local_amount":115673.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27080619},{"amount":12.5,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-04-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T15:21:19Z","rounded_local_amount":115673.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35973832},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":300000,"processed_date":"2009-07-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T12:46:26Z","rounded_local_amount":347019.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63165859},{"amount":12.5,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-08-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T14:01:13Z","rounded_local_amount":115673.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73591238}],"funded_date":"2008-09-19T04:44:16Z","paid_date":"2009-09-15T14:01:13Z","journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":67225,"name":"Elmeddin","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Elmeddin R. is 23 year old.

This is why their network was split into nineteen sub-groups of five persons each to ensure a better profit outcome. For the second time, they are requesting a loan of 100,000 francs per member, that is 500,000 francs per sub-group, to develop their various businesses.\r\n\r\nHowever, payments are made at the monthly meetings to the group president, assisted by the group treasurer, Ms. Coumba Seck, who are then responsible for reimbursing U-IMCEC.

She aims to generate an average monthly profit of 10,000 FCFA - a proportion of this will be saved for social ends and the rest re-invested in the business.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Danielle Treharne, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":528435,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"For purchasing yams","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Siekourani  ","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2010-04-24T11:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":725,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Anchata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mariam ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maimouna","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Zermene ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Adiaratou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Djienebou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Adiara ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":350000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":87500},{"due_date":"2010-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":87500},{"due_date":"2010-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":87500},{"due_date":"2010-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":87500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":181.25},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":181.25},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":181.25},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":181.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":181.25,"local_amount":87500,"processed_date":"2010-04-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T12:15:41Z","rounded_local_amount":88605.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136746655},{"amount":181.25,"local_amount":87500,"processed_date":"2010-05-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T10:03:40Z","rounded_local_amount":88605.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144779232},{"amount":181.25,"local_amount":87500,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:17:03Z","rounded_local_amount":88605.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151961438},{"amount":181.25,"local_amount":87500,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T12:01:32Z","rounded_local_amount":88605.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159699556}],"funded_date":"2010-04-24T14:28:45Z","paid_date":"2010-08-15T12:01:32Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Danielle Treharne","image":null}},{"id":199181,"name":"Sosan Yaqoobi Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ziba is the daughter of M.

","en":"Karina, age 34, was widowed three years ago.  She lives alone with her two small children in her own house.\r\n\r\nFor six years she has been growing coffee, bananas, corn, and citrus fruits on her own fields.  She also has some rented fields.  She works with the help of workers who keep the fields on her farm cleared.  That way she is able to get her harvest on time.\r\n\r\nShe learned farming techniques thanks to her father\u2019s lessons.  He did not want his daughter dependent upon any man.  What she likes most about her occupation is selling the harvests in the markets in the city where she lives.  She saves the money that she earns.  With effort she bought the possessions that she now has.  As an enterprising woman she plans to later plant a greater quantity of coffee and bananas.\r\n\r\nThis is her first loan with MFP.  Ever since her first meeting she was sure that she liked working with her communal bank.  She likes it because they have given incentives to save.

The region is part of the province of Lambayeque and is located more than an hour and a half from the city of Chiclayo.\r\n\r\nMaria raises and sells small animals. Thanks to this activity she helps her husband pay their family expenses. Now she is raising barn-yard fowl in a space at the back part of her house. When they have reached a good level of development, she offers them for sale to the business people who always visit the area where she lives.\r\n\r\nMaria wants to acquire small birds to increase her business and balanced feed to complete raising them in such a way that she can get more income. For this reason, she has applied for the first time to Edpyme Alternative for a loan of 1000 PEN, which will help her reach her goal.\r\n\r\nMaria is an ambitious and hard-working woman. Her greatest desire is to continue helping her husband so that their children can advance. In the area where she lives, she is known to be a responsible and trustworthy woman.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Pam McMurry, Kiva

family of three people. He has two children. Rahmon is originally from Isfara, a city in the south of Tajikistan. He started his business 15 years ago, after a desperate period of unemployment when his family didn\u2019t get enough for their most basic needs. Today, he offers his services as a woodworker. Rahmon has a perfect credit history. He has already repaid one loan from IMON International without any delinquencies. This time, Rahmon is requesting a loan of $1200 USD to purchase wood products like bold timber, plank timber for his production. We believe this loan will also be repaid promptly. \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

After four years of building her business, she has cultivated successful relationships with several large corporations and expanded her business into nine different states. Her modeling business has also received several minority awards and has become a staple of the Atlanta community. \r\n\r\nRose originally approached ACCION USA when commercial banks were not willing to give her loans and she did not want to see four years of successful small business destroyed. This is Rose\u2019s second loan from ACCION USA. She used her previous loan to help her gain new business, especially after several of her contracts were pulled due to the downturn in the economy. She will use this loan to provide her business with a cushion so she can focus on rebuilding many old contracts and pursuing new and exciting ventures. \r\n\r\nRose is very proud of her business and has worked very hard to achieve the status her agency currently enjoys. She looks forward to growing into the future and continuing to build her reputation as a formidable businesswoman. \r\n\r\nAlso take a look at Rose\u2019s website http:\/\/www.umodelinc.com

She lives with the youngest of her 6 children in her own home.  She started learning agricultural techniques when she was a little girl.  Since that time, she has been growing vegetables; some greens but mainly potatoes and corn which are the products which sell most.  Her work is daily but over the years she has come to realize that the buying and selling of animals is a very profitable business.  This activity complements her income since it takes time for her crops to be ready for harvest.  On weekends she sells her animals at the livestock market and what she doesn't manage to sell she takes home to her stable and uses it for her own consumption.  Over her  working life, she has seen that the sale of animals has less risks and makes more profits.  For this reason, she would like to increase her working capital and put more time and effort into raising animals.\r\n\r\nThis is Elva's 7th loan with MFP.

She is 36 years old, married, and has no children.  She began with a 1000 new sol investment and, fueled by both her husband's and her own entrepreneurial spirit, started a brick manufacturing and sale business since they have a large enough parcel of land and the raw materials, such as clay, needed for the manufacture of bricks.  She is still engaged in the same activity and, thanks to the high quality of her products, she sells to public and private institutions filling orders that number in the thousands of bricks.  In her free time she likes to sell clothing which she offers to her friends and neighbors who have shown a positive response to the wares.  With this new 3000 new sol loan she intends to purchase gallons of fuel and bundles of fire wood which will be used to fire the bricks.  Both her husband and herself share in decision-making with respect to their profits.

He chose to get a permanent job so he could give a good education to his two children, who are 2 and 10 years old. Marvin is 34 years old and he hopes to be able to make a good house for his family that is more secure than their house that is lined with zinc and has a dirt floor. He is happy to have his own house but he wants to make it better. He wants to use this loan to buy construction materials such as stone, sand, cement and iron to begin to build a house of concrete. With the last loan he was able to build a room of wood.

Eufemia has been to this business activity for less than a year and earns approximately 4,000 PHP a month from these activities.\n\nIn 2009, Eufemia joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Eufemia has successfully repaid a previous loan of 4,000 Philippine pesos from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. \n\nEufemia is requesting a new loan of 7,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional inventory and working capital.

They also have small businesses that they run outside of the factories like raising pigs or chickens, selling food or clothing.  The group leader who helped to found the group is Victoria who works in the factory baking bricks.  She lives alone with her 4 children in her own home which she built thanks to her own hard work.  She will use the money from the loan to buy construction materials to finish building her kitchen.  Maria is the bank's treasurer and provides food to the majority of the factory workers.

Merlita is married and has four school-aged children. \r\n\r\nIn 2009, Merlita joined ASKI to gain access to financial services.

This previous loan was used to purchase additional raw materials to expand product offerings. \r\n\r\nMerlita is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase tools and other equipment to expand the business. This loan will be the fifth loan taken out by Merlita from ASKI.

It has 38 branches covering the central and northeastern areas.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Gaining a good market share, he managed to go off on his own and start his own advertising agency venture.  He dedicates himself to creating corporate image campaigns, marketing, publicity campaigns, event planning, typography, graphic design, allocation of office supplies and general sales of publicity materials.  \r\n\r\nHe started this business 4 years ago and his customers include travel agencies, individuals, and other enterprises that recommend his services because they know the quality of the work that Rafael produces.  The financial state of his micro-enterprise goes according to the amount of activity he carries out.  He makes his purchases in cash, and manages a net working margin no smaller than 39.80%.  Meanwhile, his inventories represent 17%, his accounts payable do not exceed 60% and rotate every 13 days; he does inventory every 6 days.\r\n\r\nHis greatest dream and biggest challenge is opening his installation in a more strategic location.  He knows that he will manage this with a great amount of effort when he is better positioned to do so.  Currently, he is applying for his first financing with the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  With his Kiva credit, he will have more access to capital to better carry out his activities and fulfill his orders, while he waits for payment from customers every 30 or 45 days.\r\n\r\nHe will use this loan for creation of posters, publicity materials, and also for a campaign he has been contracted to do along the Caribbean Coast of Colombia, however his working capital is insufficient for this grand undertaking.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1150,"image":{"id":815275,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"create posters and publicity materials, as well as carry out a campaign he has planned throughout the Caribbean Coast of Colombia.

Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Desde muy joven se ha dedicado a labrar la tierra, siembra frutos c\u00edtricos y pl\u00e1tanos, pero no solo se ocupa en su chacra, sino que tambi\u00e9n trabaja para los vecinos que requieran de sus servicios para abrir trochas, dependiendo el tama\u00f1o cobra entre 200 a 300 soles, de acuerdo a los arbustos que est\u00e9n en la tierra, seg\u00fan la dificultad var\u00eda el precio.

He has been living with the mother of his children for roughly 13 years, during which she has been able to build a house in the highlands near his farmland.  He has been working the land since he was very young, sowing citrus fruit and bananas.  In addition to tending his farm, he works for his neighbours who need his services to create trails for which he charges between 200 and 300 soles depending on the size of the trail,  the size of the shrubs to be removed, and the difficulty of the particular job.  At harvest time, he prepares loads of fruit to take to market, usually every two weeks or at month-end.  At other times, he harvests from 4:00 in the morning as he must take his time to prepare the loads correctly and later in the day it is intensely hot and uncomfortable to work in.  When there are buyers in the area he sells in bulk: bananas are sold in 12 kilogram loads.  He makes these preparations in April and May, when the price of bananas is better.  Citrus fruit, however, are at their peak from January to March.  Jos\u00e9 prefers to pay to have his fruit transported to the city and sell it himself because he makes more money this way than by selling to the buyers who come to the farms and pay a lower price.  This is the first loan he is asking for from MFP and he is able to pay on time as he does not want to let down the other members of his community bank who are on their sixth loan, as he is a new member.  He will use the loan to fertilize his farm, and he feels this is enough for now.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Laure Kwon, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":255136,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy fertilizer for his farms.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-01-16T22:30:23Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":175,"lender_count":4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jos\u00e9","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":63},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":63},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":63},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":63},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":63},{"due_date":"2009-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":63},{"due_date":"2009-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":63},{"due_date":"2009-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":59}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":22.05},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":22.05},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":22.05},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.05},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.05},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.05},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.05},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":22.05,"local_amount":63,"processed_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T14:06:12Z","rounded_local_amount":68.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":10228386},{"amount":22.05,"local_amount":63,"processed_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T20:06:05Z","rounded_local_amount":68.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20423621},{"amount":22.05,"local_amount":63,"processed_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:37:18Z","rounded_local_amount":68.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27116889},{"amount":22.04,"local_amount":63,"processed_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:46:56Z","rounded_local_amount":68.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36011811},{"amount":22.05,"local_amount":63,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T00:59:53Z","rounded_local_amount":68.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44595404},{"amount":22.05,"local_amount":63,"processed_date":"2009-06-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:41:24Z","rounded_local_amount":68.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52989645},{"amount":22.06,"local_amount":63,"processed_date":"2009-07-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:43:01Z","rounded_local_amount":68.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63210783},{"amount":20.65,"local_amount":59,"processed_date":"2009-08-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:23:34Z","rounded_local_amount":64.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73640412}],"funded_date":"2009-01-16T22:39:17Z","paid_date":"2009-09-15T19:23:34Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"L K","image":355766}},{"id":87744,"name":"Arusha Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Tausi S., age 60, is married with four children ages 30, 26, 24 and 13.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

With the money that she is now applying for she will buy a greater quantity of clothes to increase her sales and in so doing, her earnings. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Suzanne Grasso, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":388407,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Used Clothing","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"Increase of merchandise","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-09-15T03:40:13Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":700,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Melita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-09-04T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":306.98},{"due_date":"2009-11-02T08:00:00Z","amount":311.54},{"due_date":"2009-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":326.3},{"due_date":"2010-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":337.92},{"due_date":"2010-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":351.89},{"due_date":"2010-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":365.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":107.44},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":109.04},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":114.21},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":118.27},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":123.16},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":127.88}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":107.44,"local_amount":306.98,"processed_date":"2009-10-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T02:59:01Z","rounded_local_amount":313.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96997502},{"amount":109.04,"local_amount":311.54,"processed_date":"2009-11-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:52:58Z","rounded_local_amount":318.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103842849},{"amount":330.69,"local_amount":944.82,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T21:06:17Z","rounded_local_amount":965.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734428},{"amount":24.95,"local_amount":71.29,"processed_date":"2010-02-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:48:38Z","rounded_local_amount":72.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123959608},{"amount":127.88,"local_amount":365.37,"processed_date":"2010-03-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:32:26Z","rounded_local_amount":373.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128992412}],"funded_date":"2009-09-16T04:22:11Z","paid_date":"2010-04-15T09:32:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Suzanne Grasso","image":357930}},{"id":141056,"name":"Mujeres Poderosas 1, 2, 3 Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Maritza is the group coordinator of the Banco D.

For this reason he is asking Edpyme Alternativa for his first, 1,000 sol, loan which will be used to buy nutritionally balanced feed.  His greatest wish is to make improvements to his home which is built with rudimentary materials and to replace the metal sheets, that are used for shade, which are very deteriorated.  He is an exemplary and responsible father.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":427937,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy nutritionally balanced feed for pigs.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"El Morante -

By the grace of God, Lina has managed to support her older child's schooling up to college level. At this time, she is working hard to be able to send her remaining children all the way through college. Lina herself has been a college undergraduate and believes that a college diploma is the best inheritance parents could leave to their children.\r\n\r\nLina operates a variety store where she also does a little direct selling. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a Php5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. Lina gets her supplies at a wholesale price and sells at a smal profit.  Her store is located next to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of Php 200 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php 21,000 loan. She will use the loan to buy more products like groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her inventory. She expects a boost in her income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nLina dreams of giving all her children a good, high-quality education through her hard work. She also hopes to have her house renovated by the end of the year.
