Dionisio also raises small animals by getting them at a less price and after some time he fattens them up and sells them at a higher price and is able to have greater earnings while he waits for the harvest of his products.

Zarbibi is 54 years old. She is a purposeful woman who is married and has 10 children. Zarbibi is engaged in trading and she started her business with glass vases and clothes. Today she sells flour in the market of Dehqon. She heard about Imon International from other businessmen.

Zarbibi would like to get a loan of 8000 Somoni for purchasing flour and expansion of her business. \r\n   \r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He is married and has 4 children between the ages of 7 months and 13. He has been selling chickens for 2 years. He chose this activity because it was profitable.

Dilshod is married with five children. This is an average family in Dushanbe, Tajikistan. However, Dilshod is a unique entrepreneur. Together with his son he has been selling clothing in the central city market for about fifteen years. The secret of his success is simple: he tries not only to let his customers know the benefits of his products \u2013 he also creates a relationship with them, which brings them back again and again. However, he doesn\u2019t want to stop where he is with his venture. Dilshod is seeking a loan of $2500 to re-stock merchandise in his store for the winter season. We believe that Dilshod\u2019s desire to excel in pleasing his customers will determine his further success and encourage new customers to buy from him.  \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She lives in Punta Balidbid, Brgy. Balidbid, Sta. Fe, Cebu. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2003 and has improved her living conditions with the help of loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her pig-fattening business, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She currently earns an average monthly income of 11000 PHP. Lolita is now borrowing 15000 PHP to use as additional working capital.  This will be her 10th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of 20000 PHP, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Lolita aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well being by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Her business is well-known for the sweets that she makes with great pleasure.\r\n\r\nThe challenge that her business faces is that there are many candy sellers going to the fairs to sell the same products.  She uses the earnings from her business to buy more ingredients so that she does not run out of supplies to make the sweets.\r\n\r\nAlfreda plans to grow more in her business and to buy more merchandise.  She plans to do this by putting more devotion into making and selling the sweets.  She plans to use the loan to buy what she needs for working in her business.\r\n\r\nThis loan has greatly helped her family in order to get ahead in the business and to keep working.  Amilcingo is a pretty town, and she is happy living here.  Most of the inhabitants make sweets.   \r\n\r\nThe improvement she wants to make to her house is a hallway.  Her hopes and dreams are to have another house, another bathroom better than the one she has, and to make her house bigger.  What she wishes for her children is that they keep going to school, that they have a career, that they become better people, and that they have good health.  She plans to achieve this by using the loan for supplies and by working and making the sweets to sell.\r\n\r\nAlfreda wants to tell Kiva and the Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad, \u201cThanks for doing me the favor of lending to me.  I am very grateful to you.\u201d\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":686837,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To buy amaranth candy, peanuts, tamarind, honey, brown sugar, and sugar to make her sweets","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"morelos","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2011-01-11T19:30:11Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":250,"lender_count":6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alfreda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-12-23T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2011-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2011-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2011-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2011-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2011-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2011-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2011-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2011-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":300}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":50,"local_amount":600,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T03:44:28Z","rounded_local_amount":611.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191430825},{"amount":50,"local_amount":600,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:45:08Z","rounded_local_amount":611.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195850078},{"amount":75,"local_amount":900,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:10:58Z","rounded_local_amount":916.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201292352},{"amount":50,"local_amount":600,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:09:25Z","rounded_local_amount":611.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206160610},{"amount":25,"local_amount":300,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:22:32Z","rounded_local_amount":305.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211233498}],"funded_date":"2011-01-12T14:38:48Z","paid_date":"2011-06-15T11:22:32Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ginny Kalish"}},{"id":268497,"name":"Henrietta","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Henrietta R. is from the village of Dicayas.

She lives with her husband and child in their home. With great constancy and perseverance she was able to get her family ahead through her small business, which she has had for 5 years. Currently, her business is growing. It is a small grocery store which is the provider of basic staples to the people in the area. Her good, kind service is one of the factors that makes her store one of the most popular in the area, with some of the highest sales.

In this way he\u2019ll be able to make the furniture faster with his new tools since his shop has quite a bit of demand and this will make it easier for him to deliver the furniture to his customers and to make them in larger quantities which will generate higher income for his family.  He will save up to provide his children with an education and to build a covered storage area to keep his tools so that they won\u2019t get wet and will be more secure and allow him to work either in sunshine or during the rain problem free.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":894549,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Furniture Making","sector":"Manufacturing","themes":null,"use":"to buy lumber to make furniture and to buy a sander.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Usulut\u00e1n","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2011-10-14T16:40:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":600,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juan Jos\u00e9","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-10-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":600,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":44.41},{"due_date":"2011-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":45.68},{"due_date":"2012-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":46.25},{"due_date":"2012-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":47.19},{"due_date":"2012-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":48.7},{"due_date":"2012-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":49.14},{"due_date":"2012-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":50.35},{"due_date":"2012-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":51.17},{"due_date":"2012-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":52.36},{"due_date":"2012-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":53.28},{"due_date":"2012-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":54.37},{"due_date":"2012-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":57.1}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.41},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.68},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.25},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.19},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.7},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.14},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.35},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.17},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.36},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.28},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.37},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.1}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":45.32,"local_amount":45.32,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:52:38Z","rounded_local_amount":45.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244562724},{"amount":47,"local_amount":47,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:03:07Z","rounded_local_amount":47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250773854},{"amount":49.61,"local_amount":49.61,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T10:16:15Z","rounded_local_amount":49.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257182435},{"amount":62.57,"local_amount":62.57,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:28:52Z","rounded_local_amount":62.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263317406},{"amount":53.98,"local_amount":53.98,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T09:24:20Z","rounded_local_amount":53.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270033072},{"amount":52.09,"local_amount":52.09,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:35:33Z","rounded_local_amount":52.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276645294},{"amount":94.25,"local_amount":94.25,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-16T08:21:48Z","rounded_local_amount":94.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283491738},{"amount":56,"local_amount":56,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-17T08:05:22Z","rounded_local_amount":56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287736291},{"amount":139.18,"local_amount":139.18,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-16T08:39:45Z","rounded_local_amount":139.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294561580}],"funded_date":"2011-10-15T15:46:46Z","paid_date":"2012-08-16T08:39:45Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":350489,"name":"Jacinta","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jacinta is 28 years old.

A very affected area was the neighborhood where these ladies live.  As a result, four members of the committee got dengue and yellow fever. Since they were not able to work, the generation of income in their families slowed down. The whole group organized different events in the neighborhood in order to raise funds to help the ladies. <p>\r\nThe businesses these ladies run are: grocery stores, mini-restaurants, sewing shops, and sales of cosmetics, clothing, remedies, jewelry, and chicken.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture, and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\nIMON's History\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

He is 50 years old. Raul is the group leader of a 10-member group loan offered by ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is Raul S..\r\n\r\nRaul is married and has 5 adult children. To make a living, Raul owns & operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising crops. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from planting and harvesting rice for sale. Raul has been engaged in his business for over 30 years and earns approximately 5000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Raul joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Raul is requesting a new loan of 10000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional seeds, seedlings & young crops to raise. This loan will be the 1st loan taken out by Raul from ASKI. He plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand his business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 38 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

His wife is a homemaker, son attends the Kapan polytechnical institute, and daughter goes to the Kadjaran secondary school.  Davit works as a driver at the Zangezursk copper-molybdenum factory.  Parallel to his factory work, Davit is involved in agriculture at the Tandzaver village.  Davit breeds cattle, bees, and also grows vegetables and fruits on his farm.  He sells his agricultural products, such as vegetables, fruits, beef, milk and honey, in the cities of Kapan and Kadjaran.  Davit likes to work on his farm very much and receives an enormous satisfaction from the fact that his family gets natural products straight from his farm.  Davit needs a loan in the sum of 1,000,000 dram in order to purchase five bulls, new beehives, frames for honey and hay for the winter, so that he would be able to gather more agricultural products in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2750,"image":{"id":855691,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

That loan created meaningful impacts in the lives of these people. They were able to use the proceeds to pay for their children\u2019s school fees. They also are able to feed and clothe themselves and their children with the income generated from the loans.

He was born in Makump village, five miles from Makeni, in northern Sierra Leone. He is married and has four children. One of his children is in primary school, two are in secondary school, and the youngest is not school-aged. His wife is also a businesswoman. Abdul sells groceries, including palm-oil (the most popular cooking oil), rice, potatoes, cassavas, oranges, and cigarettes.\r\n<p>\r\nWith this new loan, Abdul will expand his business. He will be able to buy at least one carton of cigarettes, four bags of rice, and ten barter (five gallons make a barter) of palm oil. Abdul sometimes buys his goods from Makeni or the villages surrounding Makump. He then takes them to Freetown, where he sells them.\r\n<p>\r\nSo far, Abdul faces no major challenges in his business. Business is going well for him and he enjoys doing it. Through the loans from SMT and Kiva, he has been able to build himself a house worth $1666 (5,000,000 SLL).

The amount that Ana Maria is requesting is C$4.300 cordobas and the amount that Jahirinza is requesting is C$ 5.500 c\u00f3rdobas. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Aimee Sostowski,

A difficult situation which hit home motivated her to look for job alternatives so she could improve her quality of life. The support of her husband and her ability to perform this type of work helped her start selling spare parts. She began with little and with the small amount of capital that she acquired, she established her spare parts shop, which everyday is more stocked and bigger. Gradually she has earned customers. Currently, she has a great quantity of customers who buy on a regular basis because they receive good service from her. With this loan of S. 1,000, she will purchase a display case in which to show her spare parts, as well as hydraulic jacks, headlights, oil, grease, screws, nuts, motorcycle chains. She wants her business to be stocked and well presented and to give good customer service so that they find what they need and feel well taken care of.

It is based in Grand Thi\u00e8s and was founded in 1992 by Ms. Maty Niakh, the network\u2019s current president. She got the idea of forming the network after participating in a training session run by the NGO OXFAM in Thi\u00e8s. She is therefore quite knowledgeable about group management, entrepreneurship, etc.\r\n\r\nThe network members are extremely devoted and meet once a month. \u00a0Beyond a membership fee, each member must pay 200 francs CFA monthly into a solidarity fund.\r\n\r\nDesiring financing, they decided to join U-IMCEC. This is why their network was split into nineteen sub-groups of five persons each to ensure a better profit outcome. For the second time, they are requesting a loan of 100,000 francs per member, that is 500,000 francs per sub-group, to develop their various businesses.\r\n\r\nHowever, payments are made at the monthly meetings to the group president, assisted by the group treasurer, Ms. Coumba S., who are then responsible for reimbursing U-IMCEC.

She earns her living by operating three business ventures: a sari-sari (variety) store, P.O Card (cash cards) and a Natasha dealership (selling shoes, apparel, accessories and personal care products by catalog order). Her husband, Cirilo R., who is 50 years old, helps his wife in running the business. They have four children, ranging in age from 24 to 29. \r\n\r\nElsa joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2001 because she wanted something better for her family. With the help of her past 18 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Elsa  has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 10,000 PHP helped her earn a monthly profit of about $100, raising the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 19th cycle loan, she is borrowing 10,000 PHP again, to purchase inventory to sell in her sari-sari store and to buy more p.o cards to sell so that she can continue to save up for the future, to continue her businesses and to expand them for a lifetime. Elsa R. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Last year he used his savings to open his own business, a meat store called \u201cEl 25 Colorao.\u201d\r\n\r\nCurrently, Libardo is asking for a Kiva loan, his first funding by Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  With it, he wants to improve his business by buying wholesale meat because he runs out of it very quickly in his store, he can\u2019t respond to demand for lack of capital.  He has already pre-sold to shopkeepers and has already been contacted for the next orders.\r\n\r\nLibardo plans to continue growing his business to increase his income because, with he and his wife's efforts, they have been able to educate their kids, who are currently in university.  One of them is already a lawyer and he wants his family to continue to prosper.  Until then his goal is to fortify his business and to purchase a freezer and a deli case for his shop.

Three of the women run grocery stores and the others sell clothing. They are all neighbours in the Kennedy region in the city of Caaupe.  One of the virtues of this committee is the interest and loyalty in the rules and regulations of the program, and in the timeliness of the monthly payments. These women also hold a capital savings thanks to the work they carry out every weekend in the markets, for special events, sporting events, and any other occassion.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>All of the members receive an equal sum of money and they will invest it in the purchase of ingredients and merchandise for their sales. The committee's objective for the short term is to improve the image of the region by keeping the public patios clean and by painting the fences along the streets and also to remodel the small plaza, in need of repair and repainting.  In addition, the play structures need to be repaired so that the children might have their recreational area to play in safely.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Translated from Spanish by Erika Lindig, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><\/p>\r\n\r\nEl comit\u00e9 est\u00e1 compuesto por 15 se\u00f1oras trabajadoras que en su mayor\u00eda son comerciantes, la mayor\u00eda de ellas se dedican a la elaboraci\u00f3n y venta de chipas, actualmente el grupo ya est\u00e1 en su 5to. ciclo del programa comit\u00e9 de mujeres.

Ana is married and she has been with her husband for nearly 8 years. She has a 7 year old daughter. They inherited the house that they live in from her in-laws. Ana has been making a living taking care of her farm animals for the past 8 years.  She has cows, sheep, and billy goats. Her husband cultivates a type of vegetable called a \"chacra\" and he also grows potatoes. During harvest Ana begins to prepare meals for her family at 5 o'clock a.m until 8 o'clock a.m and afterwards she gathers the potatoes and the vegetables and prepares them to get them ready to sell at the marketplace. Before she leaves to go to the market she ties up her cows and her billy goats to posts so that they will not escape and ruin her neighbors' cultivations. Ana is really happy with raising her animals and cultivating her plants, and now she wants to start selling firewood. She wants to take advantage of having a lot of trees around her home. With the firewood sales she wants to improve the quality of life for her family. Ana has received 5 consecutive loans through MFP and she has shown that she is punctual in making the payments. She has been really happy with the policies of the communal bank and she is in charge of taking notes during each of their meetings. With this loan she wants to buy fertilizers for her vegetables, and buy more baby sheep of a good breed.  Her plan is to raise the animals to grow and get fat and then resale them at a better price so that she can earn more money.\r\n<p>\r\n(Translated by Mariela of San Roque High School)\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by San Roque School, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":289117,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy fertilizers and small billy goats ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-03-20T22:20:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-03-06T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-02T08:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":325}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":65,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:42:12Z","rounded_local_amount":206.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87080174},{"amount":260,"local_amount":800,"processed_date":"2009-11-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:52:57Z","rounded_local_amount":826.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103841974}],"funded_date":"2009-03-20T23:32:10Z","paid_date":"2009-12-15T13:52:58Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kendra Gaete","image":null}},{"id":99708,"name":"Ni Ketut Tiyarmini","description":{"languages":["id","en"],"texts":{"id":"Pada periode pertama, Ni Ketut Tiyarmini menggunakan uang hasil pinjaman dari Dinari untuk memperbaiki kandang babinya.

She is one of the most popular food vendors in her neighborhood. She is 42 years old and married with three children, all of whom are currently in school. \r\n\t\r\n<P>She serves many kinds of local dishes, like fufu, rice balls, and banku, among others. Fufu is a starchy dumpling that is prepared from pounded cassava and plantains and is eaten with soup.

SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self-esteem.\n\n\n *Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

C) as its name indicates is a network of women who engage in trading. It is based in Grand Thies and was set up since 1992 by Madam Maty Niakh, the current chairwoman of the network. This woman got this idea at the end of a training course that she had received from an NGO OXFAM in Thies. Thus, She knows group management, entrepreneurship etc. The members of the network are extremely dedicated and they meet once in a month. So, each member is required to make a monthly contribution of 200 FCFA to a mutual fund after subscription fees to the network. Hoping to finance themselves, they decided to join U-IMCEC. Their network was thus split to 19 sub-groups of 5 individuals in order to take better advantage of the funding. They are each requesting for the second time a loan of 100 000FCFA that is 500 000FCFA for each sub-group in order to grow their various businesses. Meanwhile, payments are made to the chairwoman assisted by the treasurer of the association, Madam Coumba Seck, during their  monthly meetings. These two are required, in turn, to repay U-IMCEC. This network, says the chairwoman, has only one noble objective:  fight poverty in the household. Currently, the network has 19 sub-groups with each having a chairwoman  and a treasurer.  Femmes Commercantes  No 9 is directed by Oumy N.. She 's been selling couscous made of millet for 20 years.

When you take care of them from infancy, you are living all their first experiences with them. Some that are now grown still come to visit me.\u201d \r\n\r\nAna\u2019s own children are also grown. Her son lives nearby and helped her to make a website for her business, but her daughter and other relatives live in Peru.  Ana loves that she is able to visit her family each year for the holidays. Before opening her daycare she held a number of jobs, and her schedule was determined by the needs of her bosses rather than her own. \r\n\r\nShe began taking Child Development classes and discovered that it was something she not only was passionate about, but also could turn into a profession. After receiving her certification as a childcare provider, she established her in-home daycare business in 2004. \u201cEvery child has their own history and needs help to come out of their shell. Every day I can hug and pay each one special attention. Preschools are bigger, and they just don\u2019t have the capacity to provide such close care.\u201d\r\n\r\nThis will be Ana\u2019s third loan from Opportunity Fund since 2007.  The financing has helped her to install new recreational equipment, including a swing set in her back yard, and to hire an employee to help her with the children. With an $8,000 loan, Ana will continue to make safety improvements to her facility and upgrade the education materials she uses each day.

Altagracia operates her own `fritura\u00b4, a small business that makes homemade snacks such as empanadas and minced meat. She is requesting a loan so that she can buy more flour, oil, pork and chicken so that she can meet the demands of her customers. After preparing the food in her house, she goes out into the community to sell. In the Dominican Republic, it is very common for people to buy a snack on the street corners as they walk to work, their homes, or simply when they are out and about. Altagracia has continued to grow since her first loan of $100.  Her loan amounts and ability to repay have increased over the years and she is now on her 7th loan in the amount of $900. She hopes that her business will continue to grow and become more stable with the help of this loan. In her free time, Altagracia enjoys spending time with her 8 grandchildren.

the way of life for many people in their village. Through her small variety store business, she hopes to make it more convenient for people to access their basic needs, especially food. Their village is very far and is inaccessible to transportation, markets and hospitals. These concerns led Teresa to think of a business that would help people in their village. Therefore, when she had access to a loan through her membership in ASHI, she put up a small variety store. From then on, her business has not only been helping her own family through her profits, but also other families through the access to goods that she has introduced.\r\n\r\nTeresa wants to develop her business further through the loan she is requesting. She hopes that the time will come when her business will become sustainable and profitable to be able to achieve her personal dreams of educating her only child at college.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":427442,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery

She is the coordinator for her group, Caminando con Jes\u00fas (Walking with Jesus), and her story is representative of the other borrowers in the group.\r\n\r\nAna and her husband live with their four children, ages ten to nineteen. They live in a simple house near Santiago, the second largest city in the Dominican Republic with a population of over a million people. Life around the city can be difficult with little access to reliable electricity and running water. Despite any difficulties she may face, Ana runs a successful shop from her home selling clothes. She plans to use this loan, her third from Esperanza International, to purchase new blouses for women and pants for both men and women. She will then sell the clothes to her friends and neighbors at a small markup.\r\n\r\nAna is very grateful for her newfound access to financial services such as loans and savings, as well as health services for her family.

For example, she has a regular post at the fair of Alasita that she can rely on working; in this manner, going from fair to fair, she supports herself throughout the entire year.\r\n\r\nThese three people are the head of the Banco D. Empredimiento, which is maD. up of ten people who, because they all know each other, form a guarantee amongst themselves that they will not miss their payments, making the bank a reliable institution.\r\n\r\nA majority of the members rely on their own fixed place of business to earn money.  The other 10% takes merchandise to peoples' homes, delivering goods to a regular group of customers, since they do not own their own homes from which they could work.  All the members are very hard-working, and their businesses are their only source of income, which they rely upon to maintain their homes and families.  They are responsible with their loans.  Currently, they are working with their fourth loan from Kiva and have not had a single problem.  They all know each other very well and work together to assist each other.\r\n\r\nThe loan they now request is to be used for purchasing merchandise and, in a few cases, to increase capital to put towards improving work places.  \r\n\r\nAll of the members are very thankful to both Emprender and Kiva for the confidence those groups have displayed to them in offering loans to the members to improve their businesses.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Kevin Lenhart, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2025,"image":{"id":483198,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"COMPRA DE MERCADERIA","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"La Paz","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.5 -68.15","type":"point"}},"partner_id":110,"posted_date":"2010-02-04T21:00:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2025,"lender_count":60,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Justina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Carla Delia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Doris Carmi\u00f1a","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Natividad","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jose Luis ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Frida Beatriz","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jeanneth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Carol  Ogalin","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lilian Betzabe","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Silvia Armanda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-01-15T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":13948.72,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":2025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":1490.99},{"due_date":"2010-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":1694.35},{"due_date":"2010-03-09T08:00:00Z","amount":1722.03},{"due_date":"2010-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1750.15},{"due_date":"2010-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1778.74},{"due_date":"2010-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1807.79},{"due_date":"2010-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1837.32},{"due_date":"2010-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1867.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":216.45},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":245.98},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":254.07},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":258.23},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":262.45},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":266.73},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":271.09}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":216.45,"local_amount":1490.99,"processed_date":"2010-02-09T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T09:47:59Z","rounded_local_amount":1508.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123901693},{"amount":245.98,"local_amount":1694.35,"processed_date":"2010-02-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T09:48:34Z","rounded_local_amount":1714.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123901694},{"amount":250,"local_amount":1722.03,"processed_date":"2010-03-09T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T08:46:24Z","rounded_local_amount":1742.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128936100},{"amount":254.07,"local_amount":1750.15,"processed_date":"2010-03-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T08:46:58Z","rounded_local_amount":1770.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128936101},{"amount":258.23,"local_amount":1778.74,"processed_date":"2010-04-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:09:54Z","rounded_local_amount":1799.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136663651},{"amount":262.45,"local_amount":1807.79,"processed_date":"2010-04-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:10:48Z","rounded_local_amount":1829.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136663652},{"amount":266.73,"local_amount":1837.32,"processed_date":"2010-05-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:07:41Z","rounded_local_amount":1859.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144696460},{"amount":271.09,"local_amount":1867.35,"processed_date":"2010-05-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:08:26Z","rounded_local_amount":1889.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144696461}],"funded_date":"2010-02-09T02:50:23Z","paid_date":"2010-06-15T09:08:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kevin Lenhart","image":null}},{"id":178115,"name":"Rosa Mercedes","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"A primera vista es claro que Rosa Mercedes E.

R. is a very entrepreneurial woman. She is 40 years old, lives in the Villa del Carmen de Soledad neighborhood, and has 2 daughters, ages 11 and 2. She holds several jobs to improve her life, mostly tailoring and retail sales. She has been a client of Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo for 3 years and this is her third loan, which will be invested in the purchase of merchandise, specifically school supplies, beauty products, fabrics and supplies for tailoring.\r\n\r\nShe taught herself how to sew and started her business 10 years ago, making bedspreads, sweatshirts, and custom clothing for her friends. As she gained experience, she earned more income that she used to buy a multifunctional printer\/copier that allowed her to offer photocopy services to her neighbors, and a display case to sell beauty products and herbal supplements. Rosa is also a connoisseur of food: she makes fried foods such as deditos (cheese roll), empanadas, and french fries in the evenings and hallacas (meat and vegetables wrapped in cornmeal and banana leaves) on the weekends. She prepares these foods with the help of her mother and her sister-in-law. She says her micro-loans have helped her develop her business because she never had access to financial resources before working with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.\r\n \r\nSince her divorce 2 years ago, Rosa has had to face many challenges alone while caring for her family. Her goal is to buy her own house for her and her daughters. She also wants to open a restaurant offering Afro-Caribbean food, which consists of a lot of fish dishes. With this end in mind, she is currently taking a culinary course at SENA de T\u00e9cnico, a technical college. The schedule, 10:00 at night until 5:00 in the morning, is difficult, but she is motivated by her dream of starting a restaurant.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Vivian Lu, Kiva

Life in rural areas of the Dominican Republic can be rough, with no potable running water, frequent power outages (if one has power to begin with), and inadequate access to healthcare, among other dangers. Despite these difficulties, Santa runs a successful business making housing crafts, embroidery, and home decorations. With this loan, she plans on purchasing a sewing machine, fabric, and other sewing supplies for her business.\r\n\r\nThis is Santa\u2019s seventh loan with Esperanza International. With her access to capital, she hopes to continue the growth of her business. Santa has used her profits from her sewing business to help pay for food and medicine that would otherwise be too expensive. Santa also has been able to use profits to pay for school supplies, including backpacks, notebooks, and shoes for her children. With her continued income, she hopes to one day purchase a computer for her family and build her own home \u2014 two very important symbols in the climb out of poverty. Santa looks forward to taking out larger loans with Esperanza, and is content in knowing that, with her work stability, her children will receive a great education so that they can become professionals in whatever they choose.\r\n\r\nEsperanza International seeks to free children and their families from poverty through initiatives that generate income, education and health, restoring self-worth and dignity to those who have lost hope.
