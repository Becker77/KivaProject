The distribution of farming inputs is part of One Acre Fund\u2019s integrated agriculture package, which includes training, reliable input supply (such as fertilizer and seeds), credit and insurance.\r\n\r\nWith the income from maize sales, Bridgity intends to buy livestock and to get food for her family.\r\n\r\nIn 2012, members of the Sibale Youth Group will each plant maize plots between \u00bd and 1 acre of land.\r\n\r\nIn the picture above, some children of a Sibale group farmer have joined in the photo and the farmers are holding maize cobs from the recent harvest."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":877096,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To source farming inputs, such as seeds and fertilizer, at low prices for the 2012 planting season","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Chwele","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2011-09-22T04:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":475,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alfred ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"David","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Teresa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bridgity","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Janet","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hellen ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-09-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":43400,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43400}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":475}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":475,"local_amount":43400,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-27T10:14:52Z","rounded_local_amount":45766.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315680417}],"funded_date":"2011-09-23T04:13:31Z","paid_date":"2012-11-27T10:14:52Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":343128,"name":"Daniel","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"\n     Don Daniel vive, en el  barrio  asunci\u00f3n, el es casado con la se\u00f1ora adula y con quien procreo  tres hijos quienes  dos ya est\u00e1n casado  y una  a su responsabilidad.\n\n     El  solicito e l pr\u00e9stamo para invertirlo en la compra de  herramientas para  su taller mec\u00e1nico, en donde viene trabajando  hace  ocho  a\u00f1os y   ocho meses y comenta que le va bien ya que   con ello  a sacado a delante  a su peque\u00f1a familia.\n\n   Su inspiraci\u00f3n \u00b4por esta actividad comenz\u00f3  desde muy peque\u00f1o  ya que  su papa lo corri\u00f3 de su casa y busco la  manera de  sobrevivir  y trabajo  en un taller mec\u00e1nico en  la que aprendi\u00f3 y desidia  dedicarse a  lo  mismo .\n     Lo que desea  es que con esta p\u00e9quela actividad pueda  ir a aumentando  su    negocio para  poder  apoyar otras personas que deseen  trabajar con \u00e9l  y as\u00ed logren tener sus propios ingresos.\n","en":"Daniel lives in the Asunci\u00f3n neighborhood.

She was an employee of her province' general store.  When it disintegrated, her life became much more difficult because her husband was away in the army and she was the sole bread-winner of her family (with two kids at school).  In 2002 Mrs. P. borrowed 50USD to buy vegetable and sell it in the local market.  When another store was about to disintegrate, she found it a good opportunity to buy those household products at cheap price for her grocery store.  With her great experience and the high demand of local people and students from nearby schools, her store always attracts a lot of customers with a variety of products.  The smile on her face proves how her life has improved.  Her husband is now retired and helping her with her store.  Her oldest son graduated from college and starts to work.  Mrs. P. would like to borrow 450USD to invest more on her business.\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Vietnamese by Anh Hoai Nguyen, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nC\u00f4 Nguy\u1ec5n Th\u1ecb Ph\u1ea5n, 52 tu\u1ed5i, s\u1ed1ng t\u1ea1i ph\u01b0\u1eddng Xu\u00e2n H\u00f2a, th\u1ecb x\u00e3 Ph\u00fac Y\u00ean l\u00e0 nh\u00e2n vi\u00ean HTX d\u1ecbch v\u1ee5 t\u1ed5ng h\u1ee3p c\u0169, sau khi chuy\u1ec3n \u0111\u1ed5i c\u01a1 ch\u1ebf HTX gi\u1ea3i th\u1ec3, khi \u0111\u00f3 cu\u1ed9c s\u1ed1ng gia \u0111\u00ecnh c\u00f4 g\u1eb7p nhi\u1ec1u kh\u00f3 kh\u0103n, ch\u1ed3ng c\u00f4 \u0111ang c\u00f2n trong qu\u00e2n ng\u0169, m\u1ed9t m\u00ecnh c\u00f4 xoay s\u1edf nu\u00f4i 2 con \u0103n h\u1ecdc.

Ni Kadek Artini wishes that her hog farming can grow without further buying piglets from other farmers or insemination. Good boar typically is 8 or 10 month old. An old enough boar can be loaned to breed other farmers' sow. Each week 3 to 5 people loan Ni Kadek Artini's boar for 50,000 IDR. Each week the boar can produce 150,000 IRD to 250,000 IDR. Ni Kadek Artini maintains the quality of feed given to her boar. Beside polard and concentrate, Ni Kadek Artini also feed the boar with free range chicken eggs to maintain the boar's condition to breed a high quality piglets. The meat producing side costs 500,000 IDR for animal feed, giving her a gross of 900,000 IDR. Hence the total income from breeding and meat producing is 1,000,000 to 1,500,000 IDR per month\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Bahasa Indonesia by Arliadi Mahadi, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\nDari dulu Ni Kadek Artini berkeinginan untuk pelihara pejantan dan penggemukan.

Ni Kadek Artini berkeinginan supaya usaha ternak babinya bisa berkembang biak tanpa harus membeli bibit di peternak lain atau memakai kawin suntik. Pejantan yang bagus berumur 8 atau 10 bulan. Pejantan yang sudah cukup umur, bisa disewakan untuk mengawini induk peternak lainnya. Setiap satu minggu, 3 s\/d 5 orang yang menyewa pejantan milik Ni Kadek Artini dengan ongkos Rp. 50.000.- sekali kawin. Dalam satu minggu, penghasilan yang didapat dari pejantan bisa mencapai Rp.150,000,- s\/d Rp.250,000,-. Ni Kadek Artini menjaga sekali mutu makanan yang diberi untuk pejantannya. Selain dedak padi dan konsentrat, Ni Kadek Artini juga memberi  telur ayam kampung supaya kondisinya tetap kuat dan sehat sehingga mampu menghasilkan keturunan yang berkwalitas. Sedangkan untuk penggemukan sampai panen menghabiskan pakan Rp.500.000.- dengan hasil kotor Rp. 900.000.- . Jadi keuntungan bersih pejantan dan penggemukan per bulan rata-rata Rp.1.000,000,- s\/d

She started her business with Rp 150,000 as the initial capital. The business gives her Rp 125,000 income a week. Even though earns small amount, she is not pessimistic. Ni Komang Sutarsini manages her business diligently to help her husband who is a truck driver paying their two children tuition fees with a hope seeing their bright future.

Untuk menyiasati hal ini kebanyakan dari mereka memilih untuk mengadakan segala sarana ritual tersebut dengan membeli yang sudah jadi sehingga tidak perlu membuat lagi. Hal inilah yang membuat Ni Komang Sutarsini melihat peluang yang besar dalam usaha produksi jajanan seperti: jajan uli, satuh, pelpelan (rengginang) yang juga termasuk salah satu bagian dari sarana ritual tersebut.\r\nMemulai usaha dengan modal Rp  150.000,- setiap minggunya usaha produksi jajan ini memberikan keuntungan Rp 125.000,-. Walaupun keuntungan yang diperolehnya tidak banyak namun hal ini tidak membuatnya berkecil hati. Dengan tekun usaha ini dikelolanya untuk membantu suaminya yang bekerja sebagai sopir truk pasir, menyekolahkan kedua anak  mereka supaya bisa sukses dan memiliki masa depan yang cerah. Keinginannya untuk bisa hidup lebih baik membuatnya tambah semangat apalagi setelah mendapat pinjaman modal usaha dari DINARI yang kemudian dipergunakan untuk meningkatkan omzetnya dengan membeli bahan baku dan produksi jajan lebih banyak

Thanks to her son they constructed the house where they now live peacefully.  She has always sold a variety of products, an activity that came to her in the streets of her city as she worked in travelling sales.  With the passing of the years she had serious health problems that impeded her abilities to carry on her work as a travelling saleswoman.  However, her son supported her in constructing a store in her home; which she has been running for two years.  Since then she has given all of her attention to her store, everyday from 6:00 in the morning until 11:00 at night.  But her working hours are less because the store is in her home and her home activities are not disrupted.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. Additionally, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\nIMON's History\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

They never had any children.  This hardworking gentleman is dedicated to his farm work.  At a young age, he learned by watching all the necessary techniques that are needed to plant and harvest crops.  When he got married, Cipriano continued with his farm work and now has the help of his wife.  He says that the land in this part of the country is very fertile.  For this reason he is growing beans, potatoes, and peas.  The work in the fields is never easy, but Cipriano cares for his crops with great dedication.  His farm work begins every day when he wakes up at dawn.  He applies the necessary substances, such as compost and fertilizers, to prepare the land for a productive harvest.  When the time comes, he will hire workers to help gather the crops to sell to the wholesalers who offer good prices.  The income he earns allows him to save and live comfortably with his wife.  Being an enterprising individual, he plans to grow more peas since the price is very good at the market.\r\n<p>\r\nThis is his fourth loan with MFP.  Cipriano is satisfied with the work of his Communal Bank because all the members complete their payments on time.  He will invest the loan he requested in the purchase of seeds for planting peas and beans.  Cipriano will begin planting in the month of May, so he wants to have everything he needs to begin a successful crop.  \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva

Julie has been engaged in her business for over 2 years and earns approximately 3000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Julie joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Julie is requesting a new loan of 3000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional inventory & working capital. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Julie from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement the family's income. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.

Her dream is to reach her goals as a family, to see her children grow into professional adults and she plans to do so caring for her business, getting more loans and saving through Esperanza.\r\n\r\nThis Esperanza associate started with us because she needed to invest capital in her business and because she believes in the program.  Her history is being used to exemplify her other group members as well as clients of Esperanza, both the Haitians (who for the most part have emigrated to the Dominican Republic from Haiti, some of them quite recently) as well as the Dominicans who generally live in very poor communities like this zone and many others like it in the Dominican Republic which have few resources; they lack drinking water and reliable electricity.\r\n\r\nThis group is located in an area of few resources called Puerto Plata, a city whose economy depends primarily on real estate and Tourism although the latter has recently been overshadowed by new, emerging tourist areas.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2000,"image":{"id":612570,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Natural

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

They engage in a variety of business activities such as general retail, providing services, and other trades.  A short time ago they learned about the benefits offered by Fundaci\u00f3n ESPOIR, so they decided to join together in order to access the loans provided by the organization.  This is their first loan as a Communal Bank and they hope to do very well so that they can continue receiving loans.\r\n<p>\r\nIt is in this place where Sra. Virginia lives.  She is 24 years old, married, and has a five-year-old son who is in kindergarten.  Her husband is an auto mechanic.  Virginia is a young homemaker who sells clothes through catalogs of various brands so that she can earn her own income.  She works four days a week by going door-to-door and taking orders.  Virginia offers her products on credit and collects payment each week.  She takes advantage of the morning hours while her son is at school and has been able to improve her sales.  Virginia receives her products at a distribution center.  She has been in business for more than a year and has done very well.\r\n<p>\r\nHer loan will be used to buy trousers, shirts, blouses, and children\u2019s clothing since she has several orders.  This is her first loan cycle with the Communal Bank.  Virginia serves as the president and enjoys the speed by which she was able to secure the loan.  Her dream is to continue forward in her business.  \r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4075,"image":{"id":964702,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"to buy trousers, shirts, blouses, and children\u2019s clothing.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Portoviejo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2011-12-29T11:10:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":4075,"lender_count":126,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Virginia Lisseth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nancy Lidia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Cinthia Monserrate","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Zobeida Armandina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nereida Juliana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jos\u00e9 Kenedy","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Stephanie Alexandra","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Patricia Maribel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yenny Aracely","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Holger Amador","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Carmen Asunci\u00f3n","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Vanessa Guadalupe","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-12-21T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":4070,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":4075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":508.75},{"due_date":"2012-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":508.75},{"due_date":"2012-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":508.75},{"due_date":"2012-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":508.75},{"due_date":"2012-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":508.75},{"due_date":"2012-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":508.75},{"due_date":"2012-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":508.75},{"due_date":"2012-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":508.75}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":509.38},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":509.37},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":509.37},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":509.38},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":509.37},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":509.38},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":509.37},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":509.38}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":1018.75,"local_amount":1017.5,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T10:17:37Z","rounded_local_amount":1018.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257183287},{"amount":1018.75,"local_amount":1017.5,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:30:48Z","rounded_local_amount":1018.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263318916},{"amount":1018.75,"local_amount":1017.5,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T09:27:03Z","rounded_local_amount":1018.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270033782},{"amount":1018.75,"local_amount":1017.5,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:37:54Z","rounded_local_amount":1018.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276645860}],"funded_date":"2011-12-29T21:17:03Z","paid_date":"2012-05-15T09:37:54Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ronan Reodica","image":498323}},{"id":380034,"name":"Gloria Maria","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Do\u00f1a Gloria, continua vendiendo en su pulperia, en donde su objetivo es invertir mas en productos, ya que tiene poco en mercaderia, ya que ha sido un a\u00f1o dificil para ella,  primeramente se enfermo de sus pies, y luego su hermano murio, en donde tuvo que hacer gastos.\nSiempre cuenta con el apoyo economico de su esposo, quien vende productos lacteos, sus hijos trabajando, y hoy con esta nuevo financiamiento desea, comprar en mas cantidad, productos de granos basicos en quintales de arroz, frijoles, azucar, maiz, caja de jabon, bidon de aceite, golosinas, productos de la coca cola, cereales y otros que son mas demandados por los clientes.\nLo cual espera poder seguir equilibrando sus ventas y tener mejores ganancias.\n","en":"Gloria continues to sell goods in her grocery store, and her goal is to invest in more products as she doesn't have much in stock because it has been a difficult year for her.

She left school after the third graD. because her mother did not have the means for her to continue her education.  She has four children, none of whom rely on her economically.  Telvina is engaged in selling groceries in her neighborhood's market.  The first business she started was selling clothing but she had to put this asiD. to care for her children.  She was selling condiments and plasticware for almost five years until she acquired her stand in the market where she now sells groceries.  With her earnings she has been able to build her stand in the El Cortijo market where she is currently developing her business.

He has been a farmer since a very young age but this occupation does not provide him with steady income to contribute to his family's support so 5 years ago he acquired a mototaxi (a motorized, 3-wheel vehicle used to transport passengers and cargo) with which he works when he isn't doing his farming chores.

ella est\u00e1 acostumbrada a caminar  diariamente, desde las 6: 00 A.m. hasta las 11:00 A.m. recorriendo mas de 10 barrios aleda\u00f1os a su vivienda en Villalozano, ubicada en el municipio de Soledad - Atl\u00e1ntico.\n\nSobeida sinti\u00f3 la necesidad de trabajar cuando su esposo muri\u00f3 dej\u00e1ndola con 5 hijos, al principio fue empleada dom\u00e9stica,  pero una amiga viendo la necesidad y la tristeza  que expresaba al dejar a sus hijos menores solos,  le recomend\u00f3 buscar un negocio independiente que le permitiera atender de cerca a sus hijos y a la vez generar ingresos; fue as\u00ed como con su ayuda se inici\u00f3 en la venta de pescado y mariscos, negocio del cual se siente orgullosa porque con el sostiene su hogar, apoya el estudio de sus hijas y hasta compr\u00f3 una nueva mejora y se traslad\u00f3 a ella arrendando la vivienda que le dej\u00f3 su marido al morir, la cual representa un nuevo ingreso.\n\nAunque Sobeida no estudi\u00f3 sabe lo importante que es educarse para la vida por esos su m\u00e1ximo prop\u00f3sito es que sus dos peque\u00f1as hijas de  13 y 15 a\u00f1os lleguen  a ser profesionales, para eso les ense\u00f1a a ser persistentes y  les proporciona lo necesario para que Angie Paola cumpla su sue\u00f1o de ser fisioterapeuta y Marcela tenga la oportunidad de estudiar y ser profesional de la hoteler\u00eda y el turismo. \n\nEl negocio de Sobeida tiene m\u00e1s de 5 a\u00f1os, pero solo ingres\u00f3 a la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo desde hace dos, a ella le recomend\u00f3 su amiga Diosa, que tambi\u00e9n es financiada por esta entidad, porque observaba que sus deudas con pagadiario \u201cno le rend\u00edan el dinero por los onerosos intereses que pagaba\u201d;

It is then she takes her cooler full of ice, fish and seafood, puts it in her wheelbarrow and goes off happily fulfilling the orders she took from customers the previous day. Sobeida is used to walking daily between 6 and 11 a.m., traveling through more than 10 neighborhoods surrounding her home in Villalozano, Soledad - Atl\u00e1ntico. She felt the need to work when her husband died, leaving her with five children. At first she was a housemaid, but a friend saw the sadness she showed in leaving her small children alone and recommended that she look for an independent business that would allow her to be close to her children and at the same time generate income. This is how she started selling fish and seafood, a business that she feels proud of because it is her family's sustenance. The business supports her children's education and even helped her buy a new and improved home that the family moved to, and she rents the home her husband left her when he died, which adds to her income. Although Sobeida didn't go to school, she knows the importance of education in life, and for this reason her biggest goal is for her two small daughters, ages 13 and 15, to become successful. That is why she teaches them to be persistent and provides what is necessary for Angie Paola to fulfill her dream of being a physical therapist and for Marcela to have the opportunity to study hotel management and tourism and become a professional. Sobeida's business is more than five years old, but she has only worked with Kiva partner Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo for the past two years after her friend Diosa, also a client of the institution, recommended it to her after seeing her debt payments. \"Don't give up your money to the onerous interest you pay,\" she told her. This is how Sobeida came to request financing, and since then she has taken out two loans, the latest of which she plans to use to purchase higher volumes of fish and specialty seafoods. She tells us that her clientele has grown to more than 100 customers and her goal is to make some basic adjustments to her new home with her added income. In the future she wants to set up a sales post selling seafood cocktails prepared with delicious sauces, cilantro and onions picked from the outskirts of her neighborhood, and the people will walk from far away to enjoy her delicacies. Her customers prefer her products because she shows them how to prepare the fish by using unique recipes, which adds to the value of her business. It is very normal to see Sobeida explaining to housewives and small restaurant owners how to add carrots, beans, garlic, onion, lemon pepper to their fish, season it to taste, tie it with string and put it to roast. This is her famous Cabrito, which is served with fried plantain or cassava, green salad and sweet water. This is how she won the hearts of her customers and positioned herself to sell her exquisite products.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Marty Greenstein, Kiva

Occidental. She earns her living as a Pepsi products wholesaler and operating a general store business. Her husband Escolastico, who is 56 years old, is a businessman, and also helps in Florentina's business activities. They have four children who are 20 to 27 years old.\r\n\r\nFlorentina  joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2001 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her previous 19 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Florentina has been incrementally lifting her family's quality of life by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 23,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 20,000, uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her 20th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 26,000, which she intends to use as capital so she can sell soft drinks in the local school canteen, and expand her business.  She will continue to save up for future business improvements so that she can help in the education of her niece, nephew and her extended family. Florentina C. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

He learned about Hluvuku through coworkers who are also clients of the organization.

Micro-financing permits people who have limited resources and have a small business to have an opportunity as a business-person in the labor market.\r\n\r\nJose began his business renting sound systems and animation service to parties and festivities that take place in the city of Caman\u00e1.  He is able to earn an average of 450 soles from his weekly contracts,  which allows him to save a small quantity of money for the quiet season.\r\n\r\nThanks to the loan of 1,000 soles that he will receive thanks to Kiva, Jose will be able to purchase two large speakers to improve the sound quality at the events where he is hired, and so be able to gain recommendations for other clients from his current ones.  The trust that's being put in him allows him to think of a better future, and with great effort and dedication he will be able to purchase a plot of land, where he wants to build his own home."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":938906,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to purchase two large speakers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Caman\u00e1","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":139,"posted_date":"2011-12-07T16:10:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jose Luis","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-12-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":84.26},{"due_date":"2012-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":87.34},{"due_date":"2012-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":92.53},{"due_date":"2012-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":93.92},{"due_date":"2012-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":98.13},{"due_date":"2012-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":100.96},{"due_date":"2012-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":105.19},{"due_date":"2012-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":108.5},{"due_date":"2012-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":112.48},{"due_date":"2012-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":116.69}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.6},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.75},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.7},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.22},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.8},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.86},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.44},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.69},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.18},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.76}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":31.6,"local_amount":84.26,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T09:45:53Z","rounded_local_amount":85.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257142493},{"amount":32.75,"local_amount":87.34,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T08:56:42Z","rounded_local_amount":88.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263271084},{"amount":69.92,"local_amount":186.45,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T08:45:12Z","rounded_local_amount":188.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":269993736},{"amount":36.8,"local_amount":98.13,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T08:59:43Z","rounded_local_amount":99.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276601641},{"amount":37.86,"local_amount":100.96,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T11:32:08Z","rounded_local_amount":102.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283090774},{"amount":39.44,"local_amount":105.19,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:08:30Z","rounded_local_amount":106.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294297952},{"amount":40.69,"local_amount":108.5,"processed_date":"2012-08-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:23:59Z","rounded_local_amount":109.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301350746},{"amount":42.18,"local_amount":112.48,"processed_date":"2012-09-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T09:22:36Z","rounded_local_amount":113.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308108387},{"amount":43.76,"local_amount":116.69,"processed_date":"2012-10-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T12:11:27Z","rounded_local_amount":118.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315344553}],"funded_date":"2012-01-04T14:28:15Z","paid_date":"2012-11-15T12:11:27Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Arabella Pollack","image":null}},{"id":371855,"name":"Samiah","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Samiah is a 40-year-old married woman from Al Hashmi, Amman, Jordan.

She had 13 children, of which 4 are still living and 3 of those live at home. When her husband was alive they planted large areas of citrus fruits, bananas and coffee in her in-law\u00b4s fields. But now her harvests have diminished because her children do not like agricultural work and she cannot work with the same intensity as when she was younger. Since then, six months ago, she began selling candies with the help of her son who works in Lima and sends her the merchandise. But she still would like to improve her business with display cases, shelves and greater inventory so she can compete with her neighbors, get more income and improve her standard of living and not just rely on the harvest of her crops, which often do not live up to her expectations.

S. was born in the Inhambane province of the Vilanculos district (790 km north of Maputo). She is married and is the mother of 2 children between the ages of 21 and 24. Her first son works in a business in Boane while the other studies. She stopped her studies in the 5th grade because her parents did not believe in the value of education. <p\/>\r\n<p\/>\r\n\r\nShe has lived in Boane more than 10 years, having come from Maputo, where she moved with her whole family, in her own home with her mother, whom she supports. Her husband works in the Cimentos de Mo\u00e7ambique (Cements of Mozambique) factory while she has run the business for the last 12 months without employees. <p\/> \r\n<p\/>\r\nShe learned how to run the business during her 24 years in the Fajardo market in the city of Maputo. She sells grains (corn which she buys at 120,00 MT per sack and sells for 255,00 MT per sack). They bring in a daily revenue of 2.500,00MT and she saves the money in a traditional rotating method (called an xitique). <p\/>\r\n\r\n<p\/>\r\nShe has never taken out a loan with any other bank. She learned of Hluvuku-Adsema (a Kiva partner) through her neighbors and has been given 3 loans (10.000,00MT; 20.000,00MT and 30.000,00MT), all for her business.<p\/>\r\n<p\/>\r\nWith this loan of 15.000,00MT she hopes to buy more products (corn and other grains) to fortify her business. She decided to ask for a smaller loan than before because of the saturation of the market. <p\/>\r\n<p\/>\r\nShe plans to pay without problems so that she can take out more loans with the objective of expanding into new areas and to hire workers to help with marketing.  \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Michelle Harrison, Kiva

She lives in her own home with her two children: Jhon, 3, and Lizbeth, 1, for whom she wants to make a better life. Ana spends her time knitting sweaters, scarves, gloves, etc., which she sells to clothing shops. Her knitted products sell very well and are in high demand. She works hard to satisfy her customers, and this has allowed her to provide her family with a good income. Weaving is Ana's favourite part of her work, and she does so with great skill. She has been weaving for nine years, and still considers it the most difficult way to make a garment. Ana hopes to one day have her own clothing store, where she will be able to sell her own work and further improve her family's income. This is Ana's fifth loan with MFP; she's already putting money away so that she'll be able to make her payments on time. She is happy to be a member of her community bank, and doesn't wish to cause it any problems. With her loan, Ana will be able to buy more wool, which will allow her to make more garments and offer more variety to the shops that sell her work. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Corinne Gilroy, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":379485,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Weaving","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"Buying wool","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Juliaca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15.5 -70.133333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-08-30T01:10:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-08-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2010-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2010-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":165}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-09-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:36:19Z","rounded_local_amount":173.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87081266},{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-10-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:05:48Z","rounded_local_amount":173.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96997417},{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-11-11T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:54:21Z","rounded_local_amount":173.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103842762},{"amount":174.65,"local_amount":499,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-16T10:47:03Z","rounded_local_amount":516.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734339}],"funded_date":"2009-08-30T01:39:03Z","paid_date":"2010-01-16T10:47:03Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":137467,"name":"Ber\u00e9e Plus Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Guislain B. est pr\u00e9sident de la Banque Communautaire d\u00e9nomm\u00e9e \u00ab Ber\u00e9e Plus \u00bb,  compos\u00e9e de 27 micro-entrepreneurs qui ont solidairement d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de contracter des cr\u00e9dits aupr\u00e8s des pr\u00e9teurs du monde \u00e0 travers Kiva.\nGuislain g\u00e8re sa propre maison de Pompe fun\u00e8bre et poss\u00e8de aussi une petite usine de production d\u2019eau pure dans la partie nordique de Kinshasa.

She is 38 years old and the mother of an adolescent son.  She makes a living by selling garments, which she does in her house, after bringing her merchandise back from the city of Lima to sell.

A desire for a happy home and a successful business venture is something Helen is working hard to obtain. Evelyn is ever determined to break people's low expectations of her. She is a CCT* community partner and is married to Romeo, an auto mechanic. They live in Caloocan City, Philippines.\r\n\r\nHelen's home serves both as an abode of rest and a venue for business, because at her home she has set up a sari-sari (variety) store to earn a living. She sells a wide range of products to the neighborhood, which includes items from rice and noodles to detergent powder and soap bars. With this, Evelyn earns a net average of PHP400 per day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operation of her business, Helen is requesting for a PHP20,000 loan. Adding more products to her store is a priority for her to improve her business, and the money from the loan would certainly be used to purchase these additional products. She looks forward to making the store grow and eventually to expand.\r\n\r\nAt present, Helen finds it hard to follow up customers who do not pay their debts on time. But just like any other hardworking entrepreneur, Helen sees to it that no challenge will ever wear her out.

She lives in Valladolid, Negros Occidental. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2006 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard on her vegetable farm, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 13,000. Ronita is borrowing PHP 19,500 so that she could purchase seeds, fertilizers and other farm inputs. This will be her eighth loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 15,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Ronita aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future wellbeing by following the Dungganon way.

On leaving her native town of Imata, having only finished her primary education, Beatriz decided to work, which she has done since her youth. Three years ago, she saved up a little capital and managed to open a food store in her home, from which she looked after her children and earned money to support them.

On the other hand, having to serve in the store all day long makes her tired, but she will continue working until she achieves all her goals.

This is a Junior Secondary School with classes I \u2013 III.  It was built for girls in September of 2005 by FAWE, a local NGO, for the promotion of the girls' education. The school has a total number of 296 pupils and with a staff of nine teachers and two security guards.<P>\r\n\r\nLast academic year, the school sent thirty-three candidates for the Basic Education Certificate Examination (NPSE) and twenty-six candidates passed with flying colors. This was a very good result by national standards. FAWE, a donor-supported school, is the only school in Waterloo small-town that teaches basic computer skills to its pupils. However, to assist other schools, FAWE allows pupils from other schools to take computer lessons in their school.<P>\r\n\r\nTeachers and other professional workers come to SMT to seek loans for different reasons. For some, since salaries are usually very small, they are prompted to engage themselves in businesses to supplement their meager salaries. Others, however, can not directly do business themselves; rather, they will invest whatever little they have into their wives\u2019 businesses. Some seek a loan in order to pursue further studies or to pay school fees for their children. And  others want a loan in order to buy pieces of furniture like chairs or a bed. Some want to either start building a house or continue with a house-building project they have already begun. It is for some of these reasons that teachers from FAWE have come to SMT to seek a loan. <P>\r\n\r\nAminata Victoria L. (first row, second from right) is the acting principal of the school. She has been in the teaching profession for thirty-three years. She was born in Songo, about eight miles from Waterloo. She is fifty-five, a widow with five children. Two of her children are grown-ups, one is in his second year in Fourah Bay College, University of Sierra Leone, the next is in Port Loko Teacher\u2019s Training College and the last is in secondary school.

She is a native of Chone, to the north of Manab\u00ed, and currently lives in Montechristi, a beautiful area where many handicrafts are produced.  She settled there 4 years ago, and now lives in the home of her in-laws, but she hopes to eventually have her own house; this is one of her dreams.  She is very pleased to work with the Foundation; thanks to the loans she has taken she has been able to improve herself both personally and in her work.  She hopes to continue working for the welfare of her family.  She sells at a snack bar during school recess from 12 to 12:30 from Mondays to Fridays.  In addition, she sells clothing in the streets.  With the loan she obtained through the Foundation she has managed to increase her business.  Now she has various orders from her customers, principally from Montechristi and Manta; the majority of them are her relatives and neighbors.  She travels every 2 months to Guayaquil to acquire merchandise directly from the distributors to increase her earnings.  Once she collects the orders she hopes to gather the money and continue buying to satisfy the orders of her select clientele.  Now she will invest the loan in her 2 businesses; she will buy bread, potatoes, candy, and soft drinks to supply her snack bar, and in addition she will acquire pants, shirts, blouses and women's underwear for her clothing business.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Lisa Grobar, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":900,"image":{"id":461175,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy bread, potatoes, candy, and soft drinks, pants, shirts, blouses and women's underwear","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Portoviejo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2010-01-04T16:30:18Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":900,"lender_count":30,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":" Maria Eugenia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-12-14T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":880,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2010-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2010-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2010-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2010-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2010-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2010-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2010-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":110}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":110,"processed_date":"2010-01-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:33:22Z","rounded_local_amount":112.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118074659},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":110,"processed_date":"2010-01-19T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:33:37Z","rounded_local_amount":112.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118074660},{"amount":263.39,"local_amount":257.54,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:07:45Z","rounded_local_amount":263.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123910648},{"amount":74.11,"local_amount":72.46,"processed_date":"2010-03-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:00:15Z","rounded_local_amount":74.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128946286},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":110,"processed_date":"2010-03-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:00:31Z","rounded_local_amount":112.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128946287},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":110,"processed_date":"2010-03-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:00:51Z","rounded_local_amount":112.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128946288},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":110,"processed_date":"2010-04-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:18:14Z","rounded_local_amount":112.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136674615}],"funded_date":"2010-01-05T18:56:28Z","paid_date":"2010-05-15T10:18:14Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lisa Grobar","image":264298}},{"id":170507,"name":"Las Fatiguillas Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El banco comunal \u201cLas Fatiguillas\u201d esta representado por la se\u00f1ora Janet  y conformada por 15 miembros que han empezado en su 1er  ciclo, la mayor\u00eda son de la misma zona y se conocen bastante bien de manera que es un grupo muy solidario por que entre todas se ayudan para que el grupo marche bastante bien, los integrantes  son 10 mujeres y 4 varones.

This will help them generate more income, and therefore allow them to better maintain their homes and improve the standard of living for their families.  \r\n\r\nA majority of the members are new, and know their products very well.

Juan is a responsible, hard-working, and above all very entrepreneurial man. Several years ago he managed to establish a small store in his home residence which has allowed him to give his family their daily bread. Keeping the business going has not been easy, expresses Juan, as in the area where he resides there are other businesses that compete with his store, and day by day there are more businesses that by one way or another are gaining ground in the area and consequently taking way customers in their favor. But for Juan this is not an obstacle but rather a challenge since this has made him be alert to the changes in the market. He counts on many advantages since he has a lot of experience and moreover, has already won the trust of his neighbors. The most important thing to him is that his customers are satisfied, which is why he always puts a great deal of effort to have everything they need. Juan is a daring and safe man, and does not fear any challenge. All of this has motivated him to apply to Integral for a loan with the faith in God that in this way he will manage to keep his business running for many more years. With the loan he plans to buy a variety of store items like drinks, rice, sugar, beans, detergent, oil, candy, etc. so that his customers continue to prefer him because of his excellent service. In this way, he hopes to be able to obtain a better opportunity in life for him as well as for his family."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":876778,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

She moved the business to a store front and started a website for skaters who don\u2019t have access to a local skate shop. She dedicates most of her time to her main job, but hopes to be at the store full-time after the business grows. Emily\u2019s derby coach volunteers his time at the business to facilitate repairs and sales.\r\nBlue City Skates sells roller skates, protective equipment and accessories for roller derby, hockey, figure skating, speed skating and skateboarding. The business has become increasingly successful, and Emily believes it\u2019s due to the need for recreational skating equipment in her community. She opened the only local skate shop within 200 miles, and most of her advertising has been by word of mouth. \r\nEmily will use this loan to stock up on skating equipment for the web store.

She attended school only up to the 6th grade due to her family's financial situation. Her father worked as a servant for the Ministry of Planning and Finance and had many children. <P> \r\n\r\nAt the age of 22, she married and had 4 children. However, her marriage only lasted 8 years. After her separation, she studied typing and found a job right away as a typist. She held this job for 3 years but had to leave it due to the long distance between her home and the workplace. In order to survive, she became involved in small businesses and in 1989 obtained another job at the Ministry of Agriculture, where she worked until she got back on her feet.

At her young age, she feels responsible for helping out with the family expenses. She lives in her parents\u2019 house, and what she wants the most is to help them have a peaceful life.  For Bertha, her youth has not impeded her from getting ahead in life. She has been working in her own general store for 5 years, and what she likes most about her business is having conversations with her customers because it makes her long work days more enjoyable. Bertha was able to set up her general store thanks to her parents, who did not think twice about investing their life savings so that their daughter can be happy and form her own future.  Bertha hopes to have a bigger store in which she can sell her products with ease. What she most dislikes is that because of her small shop, she cannot serve too many customers at a time.

The crops that are designated for consumption are sold directly at the wholesale market in Tarma (which is a one hour drive from their farm).  The potato seedlings are sold in town and can generate a good profit.  \r\n<p>\r\nRosalbina hopes to increase her plantings so that she can earn more revenue when she sells her products.  She will be taking her ninth loan with MFP, which she promises to repay on time.  She hopes to receive more loans in the future so that she can continue growing her crops.  At the moment, she is using animal manure to fertilize her fields.  With the current loan she requested, she plans to buy chemical fertilizers.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1025,"image":{"id":379535,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Purchase fertilizers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-08-29T08:40:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1025,"lender_count":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosalbina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-08-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":3000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1025}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":1025,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2010-04-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:37:32Z","rounded_local_amount":3034,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136717237}],"funded_date":"2009-08-29T13:59:08Z","paid_date":"2010-05-15T11:37:32Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ronan Reodica","image":498323}},{"id":137499,"name":"Stella Osbohen","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Stella Osbohen is 37 years old and married with three children.

Together they live in her own house.  Her work is to elaborate and sell decorative garments woven by hand.  This provides the necessary income to contribute with her husband to household costs.\r\n\r\nFrom a very young age, she learned this skill from her mother, who with much patience taught her the secrets of realizing good weaving.  Today she puts into practice these techniques to achieve a high quality of goods.\r\n\r\nMaria does weaving by request, taking advantage of residing in a zone where the culture leads one to be a good weaver. This has given her an advantage in this art; the work is very profitable.  In the future, she wants to work very hard to have her own workshop, and in addition, to buy weaving machines.\r\n\r\nThis is Maria's 6th loan with MFP, and she has committed herself to being very punctual in all her payments.  With the loan she solicits, Maria will buy supplies, including wool and new needles, in order to continue weaving and in this manner, to augment her production.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from

She earns her living by operating 2 business ventures:  general store and pig fattening.\r\n\r\nSylvia joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2001 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 14 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Sylvia has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow.

suburb of La Cruz in the city of San Lorenzo. Each one of the members has their own business. They are very close and determined to move forward in life. Each one carries out different activities, which are as follows: \r\n\r\nMaria Lidia G. is 33 years of age, married and has three children who rely on her and her husband. Maria runs a small local store and also makes tortillas. She works in the store each morning until 2pm and afterwards she makes and sells tortillas. She will use this loan to purchase groceries to stock up her store.\r\n\r\nReyna Isabel G. is 47 years of age and a single mother to four children. Reyna makes and sells tortillas and also raises pigs. She will use this loan to purchase corn, wood and lime to increase her tortilla production. Reyna's dream is to have her own home, now that she has a site where she will build her house. \r\n\r\nJose Francisco G. is 38 years of age and single, but he has two children who rely on him for support. Jose lives in his mother's house and he has sold white fish, red fish and aloe vera plants for the past year. He will use this loan to purchase fish. A little while ago he purchased a car to transport his products and this made his sales easier.

This got me interested in woodcarving, and I also did well in art classes at school. After graduation, I decided to go back and assist the carvers. Even though they couldn't pay me much, I felt happy and satisfied, and was glad to go to work with each new day. Now I work on my own. The most challenging part of this craft is when am designing my work, and the nicest part is when I mix colors to paint.
