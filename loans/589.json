Sales are made at the house, door-to-door, and at the marketplace, cash or credit accepted from customers composed of men and women. \r\n<p>\r\nThe group members envision realizing an average monthly profit of 22,500 francs CFA that will be used to make loan payments and to help cover family expenses.  \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":290127,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"To buy condiments, peanuts, fonio, and potatoes ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"S\u00e9gou","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2009-04-01T07:00:28Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":700,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mah                             ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Assan    ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatoumata                          ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sayon    ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mach\u00e9   ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mah   ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mass\u00e9tou                      ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-03-06T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":350000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":58333.33},{"due_date":"2009-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":58333.33},{"due_date":"2009-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":58333.33},{"due_date":"2009-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":58333.33},{"due_date":"2009-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":58333.33},{"due_date":"2009-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":58333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.67},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.67},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.67},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.67},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.67},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":116.66,"local_amount":58333.33,"processed_date":"2009-04-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:28:19Z","rounded_local_amount":58718.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36033737},{"amount":116.67,"local_amount":58333.33,"processed_date":"2009-05-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:38:56Z","rounded_local_amount":58718.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44621104},{"amount":116.67,"local_amount":58333.33,"processed_date":"2009-06-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:21:18Z","rounded_local_amount":58718.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53020070},{"amount":116.68,"local_amount":58333.33,"processed_date":"2009-07-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T19:19:07Z","rounded_local_amount":58718.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63242815},{"amount":116.67,"local_amount":58333.33,"processed_date":"2009-08-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T22:42:23Z","rounded_local_amount":58718.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73678431},{"amount":116.65,"local_amount":58333.35,"processed_date":"2009-09-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T03:55:11Z","rounded_local_amount":58718.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87112463}],"funded_date":"2009-04-05T02:05:18Z","paid_date":"2009-10-16T03:55:11Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Daniel Kuey","image":669418}},{"id":100208,"name":"Mery Marina","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Mery es socia del Banco Comunal Azucenas.\nMery es casada, tiene 25 a\u00f1os y 3 hijos, Mery vende comida y gelatinas sus ventas los realiza en un terminal de buses de transporte urbano, actividad que realiza todos los d\u00edas con el apoyo de su mama.\nMery necesita un pr\u00e9stamo de 800 soles dinero que ser\u00e1 invertido en la compra de arroz, az\u00facar.\nLos sue\u00f1os de Mery son construir su casa y tener un carro para que su esposo trabaje.\n","en":"Mery is a member of Banco Comunal Azucenas.

The 12 members of the group have chosen Lotty as their representative. Lotty and most of the group sell products such as groceries in neighborhood stores, food, clothing and shoes and the rest of the group work at different activities such as making wood furniture, public transportation and cutting hair in beauty shops. There is a lot of competition in the marketplace and the members have to try doubly hard to earn money for their households. For this reason they need financing which will help them grow their small businesses so that with more merchandise and working tools in good condition they can generate more income, thus providing a better standard of living for their families.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Molly Puglisi, Kiva

It was the location for the end of Alexander the Great's rule, and is known for its great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country, with its epic mountain passes, is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mix of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<br>However, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the USSR, damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 per cent of the country is mountainous and only 7 per cent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands of people to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>More about IMON International<\/b><br>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition.

By working hard in her general store and photography business, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 28,000.\r\n\r\nAlicia is now borrowing PHP 17,000 so that she can sustain her general store. This will be her 18th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 19,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Alicia aspires to elevate her family\u2019s living conditions and ensure their future wellbeing by following the \u201cDungganon\u201d way.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress out of earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":509626,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

M., 57, is married to Ricardo M., a farmer.

She regularly attends their weekly fellowship meetings and pays her weekly dues consistently. Because of her good repayment performance with her previous loans, she was able to borrow quite a few times from CCT\u2019s Cooperative. She uses the money she borrows to expand and improve her fruit business.     \r\n\r\nTo ensure the success of her business, she would like to apply for a PHP 10,000 loan to replenish and maintain her fruit inventory.

Mohira grew up in a home where the principal work was, and is, agriculture. She acquired skills in this field when she was very young from working with her parents. Agriculture has become her principal source of income and she dedicates most of her time to the attention and care of her agricultural products. Through her daily work, she looks to give her family security and economic stability. However, due to unexpected difficulties, she cannot cover all of her expenses, and she needs a loan to improve her products and increase her sales.

It was the site of a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, Western culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n\t\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after it gained its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History \r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

S. is from the village of San Roque, Enrile, Cagayan. She is 46 years old. Gemma is married and has 4 school-aged children. To make a living, Gemma operates a family member's business venture in the retail sector running a general store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling daily use products such as shampoo, soap & toothpaste in the local community. Gemma has been engaged in her business for over 3 years and earns approximately 2,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Gemma joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Gemma has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from ASKI. Gemma is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP, which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This loan will be the third loan taken out by Gemma from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to financially support immediate members of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines.

She is 45 years old, is widowed and has two children. Julia's level of education is elementary school. \r\n\r\nShe has been working with field partner Movimiento Manuela Ramos for a year. Her initial loan was for 200 nuevos soles (PEN) which she used in her business selling clothes.

Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed not-creditworthy by financial institutions as they lack tangible collateral assets.  This leads to poor financial support, hence poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.\r\n\r\nSELFINA buys and leases equipment to women.

is already 53 years old and happily married to Cirilo B., who is a farmer. They live in Barangay Sto. Tomas, Alicia, Isabela. They were blessed with four children who are: Loren, 31 years old; followed by Lea Amor, 25 years old, married; next to her Rosalie, 21 years old, a college undergraduate; and the youngest. Merriam Mae, 17 years old, a special child due to her physical and mental disability (cerebral palsy). Frenelinda and her husband work together for the progress of their family. They consider their special child as a motivating factor to achieve their goals for their family.  \r\n\r\nOne source of their family income is the village store aside from farming. Frenelinda maintains the business while her husband maintains their farm with the help of their sons-in-law. She was a rolling store vendor in the past, but after a few years, she shifted into managing a store in order to take good care of her special child at home while doing the business at the same time. Frenelinda hopes to improve the business. Thus she wants to borrow a loan amounting to PHP8,000 to purchase more inventory, thereby minimizing transportation expenses.

Michelsen","image":23924}},{"id":120704,"name":"Gladys","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Gladys I. is a married mother of three, living in Geneku, Cameroon. She has been a member of GHAPE since 2006 and has borrowed from the organization twice before. Through these loans, she has been able to establish for herself a restaurant and bar.\n\nThrough her first two loans, Gladys has seen her home life improve, has been able to pay school fees, provide for her family, and has been able to give them better food. In addition to that, Gladys is now able to ensure that her family will have access to quality medical care.\n\nFollowing her first and second loans, Gladys has requested another loan from GHAPE. This time around, she is requesting 150,000 Fcfa from the organization. With this next loan, Gladys hopes to be able to expand her restaurant and include a provisions store where beer will also be sold.\n\nBy expanding her business, not only will Gladys be making more money and be helping her family, but she will also be providing a valuable service to different members of the community. As it stands right now, some members of the community need to travel long distances just to be able to get something to eat. By expanding her business, Gladys will be able to shorten the distance that many people have to travel in order to eat, and thus will be improving the quality of life of those folks.\n\nGladys\u2019s business is sure to succeed with these new developments, simply on account of the fact that there are a couple of primary and secondary schools nearby where teachers, students and families often pass by. Beyond this, she has been experiencing an increase in business lately as more customers are patronizing her restaurant. With more services to offer, she is almost sure of further growth and success.\n\nGladys chooses to work with GHAPE empowerment credits not only because of the favorable terms of the loans, such as the low interest rates and lack of requisite collateral, but also because of the ability for borrowers to make payments over time, thus relieving the financial burden on individual borrowers, and freeing them from a potential debt trap or cycle.\n\n\nAbout GHAPE\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon. GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach. Every client is trained in business management, basic health, life skills, financial management, profit and loss, and family values. Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement. GHAPE instils a sense of family and community within its clients and staff and has developed a strong bond of trust between the organization and its clients.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":349214,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Restaurant","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To

Her divorce has made her a stronger woman and a better mother. She is doing her best to provide for her only son, a school student. As a divorced woman she receives child compensation in amount of four and half dollars a month from the government. So Janyl cannot depend on or ask help from anybody. Now she has to rely on herself. \r\n<p>\r\nEven though she is forty-three years old, her age has not prevented her from making a major change in her life. About two months ago a friend of hers went to trade in another market and left her stall to Janyl. Janyl, who had never done trading before, gave up her former occupation and decided to take a risk. She invested all her money, $700, in women\u2019s clothing and started selling. Very soon the sales started to go well, and she has been able to increase her turnover up to $535. Now she is making $200 a month. \r\n<p>\r\nHer son also helps her run the stall after school. Janyl is teaching him some basic lessons of survival, giving him a chance to earn his own pocket money. Janyl has applied for this loan to purchase more goods, mainly women's seasonal clothes. She is eager to work hard and increase the turnover. She wants to buy a more profitable spot for the stall. \r\n\r\nThese are Janyl\u2019s partners: Aftandil, Jumabubu and Jyrgalbubu. Aftandil, 31, has two daughters. Aftandil\u2019s relative has suggested that she set up in business. This relative trades in bedclothes. So Aftandil has decided to obtain this loan and purchase bedclothes for resale.\r\n \r\nJumabubu, 48, is divorced and has one son. Her husband is temporarily unemployed, so Jumabubu supports her family by selling foodstuffs. She needs a loan to purchase goods, mainly foodstuffs.\r\n \r\nJyrgalbubu, 45, is a widow and has one thirteen-year-old daughter. Jyrgalbubu is engaged in sewing. She makes traditional articles and takes them in to some shops. She needs a loan to purchase fabric at \u201cMadina\u201d market, since fabric is cheaper there.\r\n \r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance, a young and ambitious socially-focused MFI in Kyrgyzstan.\r\n\r\nMol Bulak Finance is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development on the basis of the 3-Ps concept - People (building human capital and taking care of its customers and the society as well), Profit (to be profitable to grow further) and the Planet (taking care of the environment).

That is why she came to the ASDIR Association to ask for a loan.  She will buy raw materials to be able to increase her sales.  She is also hoping to get her family ahead so they can have better living conditions.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva

He found out about Hluvuku from the district secretary, who is also a client of the institution.  This is his first loan with Hluvuku.  He is requesting 10,500 MZN, which he plans to use to buy products (flour, canned sardines, batteries, beer, soda, etc.) to increase his inventory.\r\n\r\nHe promises to pay back the loan on time in order to have access to others in the future.  He plans to request new loans to help him expand his business.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":651940,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To

The ladies raise animals like bulls, cows, pigs, turkeys and chickens.

She is requesting a loan to buy more animals as well as feed to fatten them up and then sell them. With her anticipated income, she will keep supporting the needs and education of her children and in addition, buy fertilizer for her corn and bean fields. \n\nThe women realize that having access to education is of great importance to success in the future. Since the vast majority of them have had no education at all, they understand this and are motivated to see their children stay in school as long as possible. The ladies feel fortunate to participate in educational trainings in their monthly meetings with a Facilitator from Friendship Bridge. \n\nWith capital and education, the women are taking steps to create a more prosperous future for themselves and their families.

They enjoy living in such a town because of its tranquility and low amounts of crime, according to Maria C.. They expressed contentment with their specific loan group because of the support that the women can provide each other in a friendly atmosphere. \r\n\t<P>They are mostly mothers who manage to proudly send their children to school, even while managing and investing in the needs of their micro-enterprises. Seven of the group members are dedicated to hand weaving traditional indigenous clothing, another four, to the resale of imported second hand clothing, and another three to the sale and production of food products. \r\n\t<P>Hand-made guipils traditional top blouses of the high quality that they accustom to sell, usually take one month to produce and sell for amounts between 150 to 220 USD, according to Silvia S.. The resale of clothing is managed by shopping at different used sales stores, finding valuable items, and selling them once more in their town and local, to people interested, hereby gaining a profit. The food producers focus on a series of vegetables, produce and either sell to middlemen or directly at town markets. \r\n\t<P>When asked about how their businesses were going, there was hesitation, but overall, they were content with the rate of growth and income that it had brought them. This was said, despite their recognition that the price of many things has gone up recently and sales drop for the rainy season. \r\n\t<P>Nevertheless, these mothers and businesswomen were proud to have their own business which allowed them a sense of empowerment. With the capability to reinvest their money and return higher profits, this struggle is made easier, according to Rosa M., and their work can carry on while they are \u201csatisfied and tranquil.\u201d\r\n\t<P>Most of the loan that they receive goes to bulk purchasing of the necessary products for their business, be it cloth, threads and dyes for the weavers, or seed, fertilizer and pesticide for the farmers. They continuously need this useful capital to allow them flexibility paying off debts, expanding their business while reinvestment, and living a comfortable life as a family. \r\n\t<P>Karla C. sells \u201cOstra\u201d mushrooms in a home-made wooden house specifically to foster mushroom growth. Her mushrooms are sold in the villages at lower altitudes down by Lake Atitlan. Her business, as well as many others of her group partners, has grown, yet she could still use this loan to make it grow even further. She said she would invest the money from loans in building a large greenhouse to produce much more mushrooms at once. Ingrid D. said she would remodel her local store with loan money to attract more customers. \r\n\t<P>Their dreams with ideal loan sizes only go so far into what it is that makes them perform the way they do. Deep inside, each of these women truly wanted the best for their family (like providing our \u201ckids with education until they have a title\u201d a HS equivalent), to show that they were independent and could actually help out their husbands, while improving their overall living

So, Rosette sold those cows and bought 2 Heifers.  After some time, she took those female cows to be impregnated.  She says that in Uganda, you can use in-vitro fertilization or you can just take your female to a place where there are males and leave them for some time.  <P>\r\n\r\nNow, she has the two original cows, plus three young female ones that are not yet old enough to produce milk.  The cows that are producing milk, produce between 5 and 8 liters per day.  After she milks them, there is a man who comes and purchases the milk for between 400 \u2013 500 USH per liter.    Rosette wants to purchase a male cow so that she will no longer have to pay the fee associated with getting her cows pregnant.  She also wants to buy a few more calves, rather than waiting for her cows to give birth again.  She will use a portion of her 2 mil UGH loan to do these things. <P>    \r\n\r\nRecently, Rosette has noticed that there is a large demand for the products of pig farming so she has decided to branch out into that.  She started by purchasing two pigs, and one is now pregnant!  But, she does not yet have a formal place to keep her pigs.  She is planning to use a large portion of her loan to build a pig pen on her farm.    <P>\r\n\r\n Rosette is a single mother of six children.  Her children range from 9 to 18.  The father of her children left her years ago, and then recently passed away.  Before he passed away, he was helping her to pay school fees for the children, but now that he has passed away it is up to her alone.     <P>\r\n\r\nShe says that as her children age, it is very important to be able to meet their needs.  She says that if you are unable to meet their needs, they will go looking for other ways to get what they want.  As her first-born is a girl who is now 18, she is particularly worried about meeting her daughter\u2019s needs.

She also has a stand selling seasonings. \r\n\r\nHer greatest wish is to continue working to pay off family-related expenses.

Lebanon is rich in its agricultural products and it is common to find vendors selling fresh fruits and vegetables throughout the country. \r\n\r\nThis borrower is requesting a loan of $700 from Kiva partner, Ameen s.a.l., to make much needed repairs to his work vehicle so that he can better serve his customers.\r\n\r\nNote: Based on the political and social challenges of Lebanon, personally identifiable attributes of this entrepreneur have been altered to protect him or her (i.e. blacking out portions of the entrepreneur in his\/her picture, not indicating his\/her name and location, etc.).

is a married woman who lives in Mabinay, Negros Oriental. She earns her living by operating two business ventures:  livestock buy and sell and food vending. Her husband Judie, who is 35 years old, works as a baker to earn his living and helps in his wife's business activities.  They have no children. Jovelyn joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2007 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past six loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Jovelyn has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 12,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 4000, uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her seventh loan, she is borrowing PHP 10,000, which she intends to use as additional working capital for her business activities to save up for future business expansion and financial security for herself and her husband. Jovelyn is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work. Help NWTF continue its mission to help the poorest in the Philippines by joining the NWTF Kiva lending team on

This leads to poor financial support, hence poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.<p>\r\n\r\nSELFINA buys and leases equipment to women. Where a client needs working capital SELFINA buys equipment from said client, extending a loan to her, then leasing back the same equipment\u2014a process called a sale and leaseback arrangement.<p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":155427,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To buy more stock of the crop in bulk.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Kyela","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-9.583333 33.85","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-04-28T09:00:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Tusekilege","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-05-12T13:27:40Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2008-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2008-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2008-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2008-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":85},{"due_date":"2008-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":85},{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":85},{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":85},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":85}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":85,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2008-06-12T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:35:27Z","rounded_local_amount":105230,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":236571},{"amount":85,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2008-07-12T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:38:52Z","rounded_local_amount":105230,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":265362},{"amount":85,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2008-08-12T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:42:31Z","rounded_local_amount":105230,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294318},{"amount":85,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2008-09-12T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-09-22T07:14:10Z","rounded_local_amount":105230,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":324848},{"amount":85,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2008-10-12T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-21T07:18:09Z","rounded_local_amount":105230,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":357331}],"funded_date":"2008-04-28T13:27:40Z","paid_date":"2008-10-21T07:18:09Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":51085,"name":"Victor","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Viktor is married with two sons ages 11 and 12.

Letecia L. is a 57-year-old resident of Pader, Barangay Aguisan, which is a part of Himamaylan City in the Negros Occidental region. She is married to Hilario, who is a construction worker, and blessed with three adult children. Letecia is also an active member of her church council, is the chairwoman of the community outreach committee, and teaches catechism in school. Even while she keeps busy with her community work, Letecia still manages her many businesses very well despite her age. She continues working because it makes her happy to earn a daily income. \r\n<p>\r\nLetecia aimed to help her husband when she opened a general store using her first loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. She noticed that the store provided a steady income if she just stocked it well with goods popular with her customers. To this end she invested in a refrigerator so that she could sell cold food and drinks.\r\n<p>\r\nLetecia did not stop looking for other business opportunities. This led her to invest in a food vending business selling fried chicken in her community. She also started a retail business in rice with her most recent loan. Because of her wise investments and her skillful business acumen, she is able to pay her loan installments on time and in full within the period she has promised. With her excellent credit record with NWTF-Project Dungganon, Letecia is being granted higher loans.\r\n<p>\r\nNow that two of her children are gainfully employed, the L. family\u2019s quality of life is finally on the rise. With her eighteenth loan, Letecia is proposing to use 29,000 PHP to invest in her general store and rice retailing business. She plans to use her profits to continue to expand her business operations while helping to support her family.\r\n<p>\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\n<p>\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the call of not just a few, but thousands of women.

Bertha says that she joined a Communal Bank with Pro Mujer two years ago after receiving a invitation from her niece.  She currently has a business selling seasonal merchandise.  Bertha has been in this business for 40 years and learned the trade from her mother.\r\n<p>\r\nThe loan she is receiving now will be used to increase her capital for buying different goods in Oruro that she will eventually sell at the fairs as a traveling merchant (she does not have a fixed location).  Working in this manner allows her to generate income to support her family as much as possible.  Bertha is in a common-law relationship and has two children.\r\n<p>\r\nWhen asked what she likes about Pro Mujer, Bertha says she enjoys the meetings and the loans.  In the photograph, Sra. Isabel is not present because she had an appointment at the health clinic.  \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1400,"image":{"id":895513,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Products Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy seasonal goods for resale.

This is fifty-nine year old Martha M. from Mwanza. She is widowed with four children, between the ages of twenty and thirty. Additionally, she is responsible for supporting two dependants who are orphans. <p>\r\nMartha has been running a shop selling different commodities since 2005. This client\u2019s business is in selling maize flour, Kilimanjaro beer, Konyagi beer, cooking oil, wheat flour, margarine, soaps, and sugar. She works at the business for twelve hours per day, six days per week. Martha currently earns about 200 USD a month from her business. She is requesting a loan of 425 USD in order to buy more stock of beer for resale. In the future, she plans to increase the range and amount of stock. Martha thanks you for her support!<p>\r\n\r\nABOUT SELFINA:<p>\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility.

She sells food typical to the region which she makes using pork and sheep meat that she has been raising herself in her stable for 10 years.  Carmen began selling these dishes 26 years ago with very little money, buying only a few kilos of meat and over time, with her savings, she was able to buy her own animals.  Each morning, she cleans and takes care of her animals because she spends the afternoons and weekends preparing the food and selling it on the main streets, at festivities, or at any social event in her area.  Over time, she has noticed the results of her efforts in the satisfactory earnings that she has obtained.  As a result, she wants to continue working in this type of business and purchase more animals that will provide her with larger earnings.  This is Carmen\u2019s eighth loan with MFP.  She is very supportive and enterprising at the communal bank and she hopes to continue moving forward with her group.  The money that she is asking for will be invested in the purchase of wholesale pigs and sheep.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Kathleen O&#039;Connell, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":875,"image":{"id":349355,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To purchase more animals","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"HUANCAYO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.066667 -75.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-07-09T02:30:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":875,"lender_count":29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Carmen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-06-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2600,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":875,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":2600}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":875}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":875,"local_amount":2600,"processed_date":"2010-04-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:37:21Z","rounded_local_amount":2664.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136717170}],"funded_date":"2009-07-22T22:34:45Z","paid_date":"2010-05-15T11:37:21Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen O'Connell","image":578556}},{"id":124848,"name":"Progressive Youths Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sunnyboy is a high-school dropout due to financial constraints.

He is 35 years old, married, and the father of 3 children with ages between 1 and 7 years old.  The oldest is in school.  Besides them he is not responsible for anyone else and is able to save 1,500MT each month.  He counts on the help of an employee and pays him 1,000MT monthly.\r\n\r\nTomas left Inhambane when he was 10 years old with his uncle to Swaziland where he went to school through the 8th grade.  He had to interrupt his schooling after the death of his uncle.  As such he was able to arrange a job in the mines of South Africa where he worked on a contract for 5 years.  At the end of the contract he was compensated 80,000MT and consecutively he returned to Mozambique to set up his residence in Namaacha on the border of Swaziland.  He acquired a wagon to help him with his daily work.\r\n\r\nToday he is a traveling vendor (sells from his car).  For more than 5 years he has sold at the informal market two times week (Wednesday and Saturday) from 7:00am until 5:00pm.  His best products are (corn flour, fruit, Omo, and vegetable oil) which he acquires in neighboring Swaziland.  He purchases his goods for 20,000MT per visit, and he earns 5,500MT per month.\r\n\r\nHe approached Hluvuku and solicited a loan for 15,000MT to purchase more products and satisfy the demand of his customers.  This is Tomas' first loan through Hluvuku and Kiva for 15,000MT which will be used to purchase more products.  He is confident that he will pay the loan off before the due date so he can request a new loan to construct his own establishment and cease being mobile.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by

He lives with his parents and is watchful of their needs, since he is a very loving son.\r\n\r\nFrom a very early age, he worked very diligently farming figs, apples and magoes in his native town.  As years went by, his parents moved to the city of Lima with him and his siblings.  This led him to completely stop farming and he bought a vehicle.  Since then, for two years now, he has provided passenger transportation services.  His workday begins at 6am and ends at 10pm from Monday through Friday.

H. is from the \u00c1ngel Corzo shore of the Cop\u00ednala Mescalapa municipality in the state of Chiapas, M\u00e9xico.  She is also known as Guadalupe.  She is 28 years old, and she went to school until the third year of high school.  She lives in a common-law-marriage with Julio Reyes Herenandez, and they have a small seven year old daughter.\n\nShe has been butchering beef since she was young.  She was in a partnership with her sister, and they worked together in the business.  After a few years it came into her ownership.  She comments that it has really helped her with the home and family income.\n\nShe is inspired to work because, thanks to the work, she has been able to get ahead day to day without taking a step backwards.  That is why she requested a loan with the Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad A.C.  She will use the loan for work, and with the earnings she gets she will save and build a place.  At the place she builds she will be able to better take care of her customers, and they will be happy and satisfied with the service.\n\nLizbeth became part of the group because her cousin, Limni, invited her to join the other members.  They named the group \u201cMariposas\u201d (Butterflies) because in their houses there are pools of water where butterflies gather.\n\nThe following people are members of the Mariposas Group:\nMirna A. H.:  Makes blocks\nLimni G. P.:  Sells tamales and snacks\nDellanira Vaquez G.:  Sells fruits and vegetables\nLizbeth, she told her story about her meat business\nEzperanza G. H.:  Has a grocery store\nMirena G.

Canonoy, Brgy. Miranda, Hinigaran, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating two business ventures, a tricycle transport business and a general store. Her husband Jerry P., who is 39 years old, works as a tricycle driver to earn his living and also helps in his wife's business activities.  They have nine children who are between the ages of 18 and 27. \r\n\r\nJuicy joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2002 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 12 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Juicy has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 10,000 PHP helped her earn a monthly profit of about $140, thus raising the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 13th cycle loan, she is borrowing 15,000 PHP which she intends to use for the maintenance of their tricycles and to purchase more stock for her general store so that she can continue to save up for the education of her children. Juicy P. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

He is from the district of San Francisco. He is married to Rosa, who is 50 years old. They have two children together, Edwin, who is 28 years old, and Noely, who is 15 years old. They live in their own house in the community of Las Palmas, which is annexed to the district of Ayna San Francisco. \r\n\r\nFor Patricio, his age is not an impediment to continuing to work and make a good living. From the time he was very young, his parents taught him to work in the fields. He is a farmer and has 6 hectares of land planted with barbasco root, cocoa beans, coca leaves, and plantains, all of which originate in the jungle area of the Aprurimac River Valley. \r\n\r\nHe has been farming for 35 years. During harvest times he has the help of his family and day laborers to bring the harvest in. What he likes most about his work is harvesting. When he sees the quality of his crops, then he sees the return on his hard work. The most difficult aspect for him is transporting his products from the fields to the city of San Francisco, which is where he is offered the best prices for his products and coca leaves. In the future, he would like to replace his plantings of barbasco root with coca leaves, because they generate more income. \r\n\r\nThis is his first loan with Microfinanzas Prisma. He feels that this support will be of much help to him in his work. He is grateful to the institution for granting him this loan. With the PEN 1,500.00 that he requested, he will hire laborers to clean out the weeds in his fields.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":712523,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To hire laborers to clean out the weeds in his fields\r\n","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-02-14T20:10:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Patricio ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-02-08T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":106.62},{"due_date":"2011-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":105.16},{"due_date":"2011-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":108.97},{"due_date":"2011-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":114.31},{"due_date":"2011-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":118.31},{"due_date":"2011-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":121.33},{"due_date":"2011-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":125.72},{"due_date":"2011-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":131.09},{"due_date":"2011-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":135},{"due_date":"2011-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":140.41},{"due_date":"2012-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":144.63},{"due_date":"2012-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":148.45}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.09},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.56},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.96},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.91},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.38},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.49},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.1},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.06},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.5},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.49},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.03},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.43}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":40.88,"local_amount":111.48,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:37:44Z","rounded_local_amount":113.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201327707},{"amount":37.14,"local_amount":101.28,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:33:00Z","rounded_local_amount":102.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206196233},{"amount":40.82,"local_amount":111.33,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:42:25Z","rounded_local_amount":112.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211269912},{"amount":41.73,"local_amount":113.8,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:33:27Z","rounded_local_amount":115.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216549924},{"amount":43.23,"local_amount":117.89,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T09:12:35Z","rounded_local_amount":119.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221718606},{"amount":44.78,"local_amount":122.12,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-17T08:12:36Z","rounded_local_amount":123.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227350034},{"amount":46.38,"local_amount":126.5,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:49:07Z","rounded_local_amount":128.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232850596},{"amount":47.99,"local_amount":130.87,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:56:46Z","rounded_local_amount":132.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238665824},{"amount":100.39,"local_amount":273.8,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:51:08Z","rounded_local_amount":277.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250835199},{"amount":106.66,"local_amount":290.93,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:19:46Z","rounded_local_amount":295.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257245007}],"funded_date":"2011-02-19T01:21:16Z","paid_date":"2012-02-15T11:19:46Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jennifer Day","image":null}},{"id":277305,"name":"Muhammad","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"O.

It was the location for the end of Alexander the Great's rule, and is known for its great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country, with its epic mountain passes, is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mix of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the USSR, damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 per cent of the country is mountainous and only 7 per cent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands of people to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>More about IMON International<\/b><br>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition.

Her parents split when she was young and she lived with her mother, but her mother didn't have the money to pay for schooling, so she only studied through 4th grade.  Life was hard, and she had to get a job at age 15 in a shoe factory where she worked for 5 years.  Her family moved, and because the new house was far from the factory, Lili had to look for work closer to home.  \r\n<p> She became pregnant at age 18 and stopped working.  Life became more difficult all the time since the father of her child was older and had a wife.  Lili had to look for another job in a tailor shop where she worked as a seamstress for a few years.  Later, she got together with a Portuguese man who wanted her to go to Portugal with him.  Out of fear, she refused to go.  After that, she met another man with whom she had 4 children and they still live together to this day.  \r\n\r\n<p>The tailor shop closed and she decided to open her own business by going to South Africa to buy clothes and selling in Mozambique.  After facing some difficulties, LIli decided to move the business and she traveled northern Mozambique buying cows, goats, and cereals to resell in Maputo.  Since this business was so demanding and risky, she quit and traveled to Inhambane where she bought fish and chickens to resell in the capital city.  Some time later, one of her daughters taught her to raise broiler chickens, which she continues to do.\r\n\r\n<p>With the loan, she will buy chicks and feed which will improve her business.

This is L.\u2019s second loan with Esperanza, and she hopes to have more in the future.\n\nSince Guerra is small and located in the interior of the country, it is difficult to access and lacks most utilities. Electricity is unreliable at best, there is no potable water, and sanitation is questionable. Despite these difficulties, L. hopes to raise healthy children with opportunities for a good education. She also hopes that with an expanding business, one day she will be able to have her own shop. Thank you for your loan to L. and to La Casa del Ahorro group!"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2050,"image":{"id":397529,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing
