Zaituni had to improve her customer relationship skills. It was thirteen years ago when she came to terms with this fact. Since then her hotel (restaurant) business has obtained a firm footing in the heart of Jinja.\r\n\r\nBefore enforcing these measures to give her business a new lease of life, Zaituni\u2019s business was fraught with all sorts of image problems. This was mostly due to the fact that most of the workers she hired had minimal training in good customer care. At length, this married mother of five buoyant children has never lived to regret her decision to train all her workers. Her business has been strengthened as a result.\r\n\r\nZaituni\u2019s journey into business began with a small farming venture that she later dispensed with. Honesty and determination have gotten her far in this business, as she currently makes 100,000 shillings, a week.

Thus, he took up his father's line of business at a young age and has operated it for himself for 10 years. He is much sought after by his customers because the less costly and better quality second-hand clothing is much appreciated in Mali. In order to satisfy customer demand, Mr. C. turned to the Soro Yiriwaso microfinance institution, where he has his first loan. He plans to buy 5 bales of second-hand clothing at Burkina Faso with this loan. He conducts his sales principally in cash at the large market in Koutiala under his shed roof to a clientele composed of women and men. With this loan, he expects to make a monthly profit of 100,000 CFA to support himself; namely, to repay the loan, to provide for his family and to invest the rest in his business.  In the future, he plans to expand his buiness in order to attract more customers.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Connie Archea, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1025,"image":{"id":579311,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Used Clothing","sector":"Clothing","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"To buy second-hand clothing","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Koutiala","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1025,"lender_count":36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Seydou  ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-07-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":500000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1025}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":1025,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T16:14:46Z","rounded_local_amount":508399.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177476798}],"funded_date":"2010-09-01T20:51:13Z","paid_date":"2010-11-15T16:14:46Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Connie Archea","image":607010}},{"id":224469,"name":"Aireen's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Aireen T. is from the village of Taboc Sur Oroq.

Her best days for sales are Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.  Her average weekly sales rise to 500,000 Colombian pesos and her profit margin is 30%.  Anlly says that she decided to start this business at her mom's suggestion and because she couldn't manage to get a job after she finished high school.\r\n\r\nIn the future, Anlly would like to sell lunches as well because her customers have requested them.  She is already saving up to buy chairs, tables and the cooking utensils that she will need.  As her business is beside a soccer field, Anlly tells us that she has become an expert advisor to the technical directors who visit her business and many of them seek her advice in determining their team line-ups.  Anlly loves soccer and it isn't unusual to see her shouting from her kiosk, giving the players from her favorite team instructions.  Through her own hard work and the support of Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, Anlly dreams of having her own home so that she can separate her business from her home and, judging by the enthusiasm

Construction, Inc., a commercial sub-contracting firm specializing in concrete installation.  When Jose started this business three years ago, he was his firm\u2019s only employee.  Now, Jose has 16 full-time employees and the capacity to manage multiple projects simultaneously.  Jose began working in construction 17 years ago as a general laborer.  From there, he worked his way up through the construction industry, gaining experience in cost estimating and project management along the way.  \r\n\r\nJose has a degree in civil engineering from the University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP), which he earned while working full-time to support his family.  In the eight years that Jose was a student, he took a variety of odd jobs both within and outside of the construction industry.  Instead of going through the motions as he pursued his goal of becoming a civil engineer, Jose took every job as a learning opportunity and a chance for self-improvement.  For example, Jose credits working at Wal-Mart with building the customer service skills he uses daily as a small business owner.  \r\n\r\nRecently, UTEP began offering graduate studies in construction management.  Jose wants to return to school part-time so that he can learn more about the financial side of project management.  He says that his educational and work experience to this point prepared him to design and implement projects, but that management and finance courses will make him a better business owner.\r\n\r\nJose is using this loan as operating capital for his business.  The construction industry in El Paso was really slow during the first few months of 2011.  In order to support himself and his employees, Jose says he rolled the dice in taking projects with several general contractors he otherwise wouldn\u2019t.  The decision backfired when they didn\u2019t pay on time, and Jose\u2019s cash flow diminished to the point that it threatened his ability to pay upcoming bills.  As someone who stakes his reputation on punctuality, Jose decided to take out a small loan for operating capital until business picked up.  In addition to supplying Jose\u2019s business with needed cash, it allows Jose to build his business\u2019 credit.\r\n\r\nWithin the next two to three years, Jose wants to become a general contractor.  To do so, he says the business will need to expand its services and add expertise, which will take time.  In the meantime, Jose believes that there is enough demand for concrete installation that his business can continue expanding its presence as a subcontractor.  \r\n\r\nS. Construction, Inc. is a family owned and operated business.   Jose employs his dad, who has 37 years of experience in the construction industry, as his chief superintendent of projects.  Jose\u2019s wife, Monica, manages the business\u2019 administrative work and finances.  For the time being, they run the business out of their home to keep operating costs low, though Jose anticipates needing to open an office if business continues growing.  Jose and Monica have three children.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":5575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":5575,"image":{"id":789952,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cement","sector":"Construction","themes":null,"use":"to

is married with three kids. She runs her own business selling children\u2019s clothing in one of the local city markets in Zaporoshye. \r\n\r\nTatyana has been in this trade for two years. Presently, she has about $3,000 of working capital and her monthly profit amounts to $600. There is a lot of competition from similar businesses in the market where Tatyana has her kiosk. However, her competitive prices and client-friendly service give her an advantage in comparison with many of the other typical businesses. Her integrity and determination have helped her enterprise to grow and be successful. \r\n\r\nTatyana realizes that access to loans is important for her business. She is requesting $1,200 to increase her clothing inventory. A good array of child-oriented products will help Tatyana better serve the needs of her clients and increase her sales. Additional income will allow her to invest more in her family\u2019s well-being and provide a better living for them which is her first priority in

They are a very close family. Pedro restores cars, repairing dents and repainting so that they are in optimal condition for the road. He learned this trade from a young age, but he left it for a while to run a telephone booth in his home. When his daughters began making crafts at home they had the idea to take over the management of the phone booth so that their father could return to working with cars and make more money. \r\n<p>\r\nFor Pedro, his work is more than a job, but an activity that he really enjoys. The work is not easy, as it demands a lot of physical exertion, but he is used to the effort. In the future, he would like to have his own auto body repair shop and devote himself completely to it.\r\n<p>\r\nThis is Pedro's first loan from Microfinanzas PRISMA, and he promises to be punctual with his payments. He will use the money to purchase tools he needs to develop his business. He will also invest in his daughters' business by purchasing items they need to create their products (beads, string, wire, etc.).\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Kris Vickery, Kiva

She is 46 years old and is married to a fisherman, Edgardo. She and her husband have three children: two in college and one in high school.\r\n\r\nFebelita and her husband come from very poor families. They realize that their lack of education has led to their poverty, and they want a better life for their children. The couple has a strong belief not to be affected by poverty; instead they are inspired to work hard for their children.\r\n\r\nFebelita joined ASHI (Ahon sa Hirap Inc.), a Kiva partner in the Philippines, in 1995; since then, she has grown to love the organization. ASHI helped her in the start-up of a business, enabling her to support her husband in their daily expenditures.\r\n\r\nFebelita and her husband have been in the fishing business for more than ten years. She now proposes that her eighth loan of Php 25,000 be used to continue their fishing business with the support of her husband. She will purchase assorted equipment for her fishing business like fishing net, rope, and bamboo. The remaining loan will be use to pay for a cow for additional income.\r\n\r\nFebelita hopes that this business will be the source of income to finance the needs of her family and to provide a comfortable house to live in. She is very thankful to all members of ASHI for educating her, especially in dealing with other people, generating an ability to accept new challenges in her life, and helping her to achieve her dreams and improve their standard of living.\r\n\r\nFebelita is grateful to the ASHI-Kiva partnership for supporting people like her who want to get out of poverty and get ahead. She hopes that the partnership continues this way for a long time and helps many poor families.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":475238,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fishing","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To

It was the location for the end of Alexander the Great's rule, and is known for its great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country, with its epic mountain passes, is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mix of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the USSR, damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 per cent of the country is mountainous and only 7 per cent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands of people to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>More about IMON International<\/b><br>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition.

There, she raised her family together with her husband of 27 years, Ignacio.  They had 3 children, who they raised and educated with love and great care.  Now they live alone in their own home.  By working arduously, Melania has been successful in improving her fields.  Every morning, she gets up very early to water her plantings and to offer the same care to her coffee plants and her banana plants.  She sells her fruits in the city of La Merced, which is where she gets the best prices for her products.  What she likes best about her work is that she can enjoy the freedom of working in her fields.  She has been doing this for 30 years and considers that the most difficult part is having to work the soil.  But she sees that she is compensated for her sacrifice when she is able to sell to the wholesalers who frequently visit the area, and from whom she receives good earnings.  She is currently in the midst of the coffee harvest, and she is sure that she will obtain the results she was hoping for.  In addition, she has the support of her husband, who sells fish door-to-door in the settlements in their area.  In time, she hopes to be able to improve her fields so she can plant a lot more coffee.  Melania belongs to the communal bank \u201cAroma de Caf\u00e9\u201d (Coffee Aroma), and this is her fourth loan with MFP, where she hopes for a small loan to achieve her goals.

She lives happily with her husband, Carlos, 64, and their children Mercedes, 31, and Daisy, 27.  They live in a pleasant home which they own and have invested heavily in to insure its good construction.  She prepares all kinds of cakes.  To do so, she equipped part of her house and there produces the most varied flavores of desserts:  turnovers and cakes, among others, which emit a provocative and pleasant aroma capable of convincing the most demanding customer.  She has sweetened tastes for over 20 years, a task she learned in pastry school and, ever so often, through courses she takes in order, as she herself states: \"to be refreshed and up-to-date because everything changes, even cakes.\"  In the beginning, Julia sold to her family and acquaintances but now she sells to many strangers who come to her home anxious to buy from her.  The person writing this account can attest to the delicious delicacies this sweet woman prepares.  This is how this hard-working woman injects herself into each preparation, mixes various select ingredients, and obtains each day the best in each cake.  This is the fifth loan with MFP and she is sure to repay in a timely fashion as she has always done in the past.  The funds requested will be used to buy a greater quantity of ingredients and to innovate some of the types of pastries because she wants to modernize the tools she uses to be able to offer still better desserts.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":420779,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":" To buy ingredients and utensiles for dessert preparation.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-11-05T19:10:12Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":525,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Julia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-10-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2010-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2010-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2010-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2010-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-11-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:55:57Z","rounded_local_amount":253.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103843157},{"amount":175,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-23T12:26:09Z","rounded_local_amount":507.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734737},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2010-02-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:49:15Z","rounded_local_amount":253.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123959802},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2010-03-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:33:08Z","rounded_local_amount":253.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128992647},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2010-04-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:37:50Z","rounded_local_amount":253.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136717432}],"funded_date":"2009-11-06T03:06:21Z","paid_date":"2010-05-15T11:37:50Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":154167,"name":"Kroem","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Kroem K. lives in Tuol Trea village in Takeo province.

She is well known in the Brazilian community and has a good client base. Her son speaks English very well and has helped her improve her business. He assisted her in working with ACCION USA to get a loan.\r\n\r\nThis will be Joselita\u2019s third loan with ACCION USA. Her previous two loans had an almost perfect repayment history. She qualified for her third loan to buy more inventory for the summer and refinance her previous loan. Her store mainly sells dresses, shirts, jeans, shoes and perfumes. Joselita hopes that during the summer months her sales will increase and she wants to have enough products to meet the demand. Her busiest months have always been during the summer and around the holidays. \r\n\r\nACCION USA\u2019s loans have helped Joselita tremendously in growing her business. Since her first loan in 2007, Joselita has consistently expanded her inventory and clientele. She has always imported most of her products directly from Brazil, which is very appealing to her customers. \r\n\r\n<b>About U.S. Microfinance and ACCION USA<\/b>\r\nHave you ever thought about how the cute new caf\u00e9 on your corner or the salon you frequent every month got the financial resources to start their business? Chances are, they drummed up support from their friends and family, dipped into their personal savings, used a high-interest credit card, or all of the above. An estimated ten million small businesses in the U.S. face difficulty obtaining loans from traditional banks, even prior to the current \u201ccredit crisis\u201d. Microfinance institutions, like ACCION USA, support these \u201cunbanked\u201d small businesses by giving them access to fairly-priced capital and business education.\r\n\r\nSmall businesses also help stabilize low- to moderate-income neighborhoods and rebuild the economy through income growth and job creation. Self-employment provides workers with a way to increase their incomes, support their families, and strengthen their communities. As unemployment rises in the U.S., more and more people are turning to self-employment and start-up enterprises as a way to take control of their economic futures and proviD. employment opportunities in their communities. The need for support of small businesses in the U.S. is great, and it is one that ACCION USA has been striving to meet since 1991.

Fresh produce, milk, and staples such as rice, lentils, and flour are purchased daily for cooking in the home.  Owners of small grocery stores use Kiva loans to increase their purchasing power and profit margins.  By keeping inventory strong and purchasing in larger amounts, owners of these small stores are able to increase profitability.  While a typical pasal might be no more than 100 sq. feet, they are always full of bargaining customers, incoming produce, and shrewd businesswomen. \r\n\r\nThis loan was administered by Kiva's local partner MFI, Patan Business and Professional Women. Patan BPW became Kiva's first field partner in Nepal in 2007.  Patan BPW operates throughout the Kathmandu Valley, offering microcredit and business training programs to low-income women.

Ya cancel\u00f3 su anterior Credikiva con gran puntualidad gracias al cual logr\u00f3 aumentar sus ventas, sus utilidades y mejorar las condiciones de su vivienda en lo que se refiere a pisos, pa\u00f1etes y techo. Con el actual pr\u00e9stamo planea comprar cuero, hilos, herrajes y accesorios.

Ya est\u00e1 ahorrando para lograr esa meta. El se\u00f1or Lenin le manda un saludo muy especial a todos sus financiadores de Kiva, dese\u00e1ndoles que tengan un feliz a\u00f1o 2011, pleno de abundancia, mucha salud y prosperidad en compa\u00f1\u00eda de todos sus  familiares.

Jim\u00e9nez makes leather straps, billfolds, purses and handbags in his workshop located in his house in Barranquilla.  His sales location is in the outskirts of the Metrocentro commercial center to the south of the city.  He paid off his previous Kiva loan with excellent punctuality thanks to which he was able to increase his sales and profits, and improve the condition of his home (flooring, plasterwork, and ceiling).  With this current loan he plans to purchase leather, threads, hardware, and accessories.  In the near future he hopes to buy a modern stamping machine so he no longer has to pay for this service, to give his products a better finish.  He is already saving to accomplish this goal.  \r\n\r\nSe\u00f1or Lenin sends a special greeting to all his Kiva lenders, wishing them and their families a happy new year for 2011 full of abundance, health and prosperity.

She earns her living by operating a general store and a fish vending business. Her husband Alejandro, who is 50 years old, works as a fish vendor to earn his living and helps in his wife's business activities. They have nine children who are between 8 and 27 years old. Jenelyn joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2007 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past six loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Jenelyn has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 14,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 5,000, uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her seventh loan, she is borrowing PHP 18,000 to use as funds for her business operations so that she can continue to save up for the future education of her children and family. Jenelyn is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

C. de Lozano is 70 years old, and lives in Ayacucho, Peru. She owns a small corner shop next to her home, and sells \u201cbebidas,\u201d or drinks, such as soda pop, beer, and bottled water. She established her business 27 years ago, to supplement her husband\u2019s income. Her clients consist of people in her neighborhood, who know her as a reliable source for their beverages. <p>\r\n\r\nWhile she runs a successful business now, life has not been easy for Celia. She and her husband had 11 children, 3 of whom died. Furthermore, 21 years ago, her husband abandoned her for another woman, and Celia had to support her 8 remaining children by herself. <p>\r\n\r\nCelia\u00b4s first loan was for US $50, which she paid back $5 a week.

This is 30-year-old Mariam W. from Mwanza. She is married with two children, 7 and 11 years old. Mariam has been running a poultry (\"kuku\") business. Raising \"kuku\" is a popular micro-business in Tanzania, especially amongst our borrowers. Kuku means chickens in Swahili, and raising them for sale is popular for a number of reasons. Firstly, they require little start-up capital. You can start with one or two and either add to them as you go, or wait for them to multiply naturally! Secondly, they require little space, so sometimes you can just let them run around in your garden or compound. Thirdly, while they are growing they produce eggs, which can either be sold to provide a supplementary source of income, or eaten to provide a supplementary source of protein. <P>\r\n\r\nMariam has been in this business since 2000 and her business is doing well. She works at the business for 12 hours per day, 7 days per week, and is assisted by one employee. Mariam W. currently earns about US$ 250 a month from her business. She is requesting a loan of US$ 400 in order to continue with her poultry business.  Mariam thanks you for her support!<P>\r\n\r\nABOUT SELFINA:<P>\r\n\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility.<P>\r\n\r\nCustoms and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. <P>\r\n\r\nOne of the primary advantages of micro-leasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":256919,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy 200 chicks","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mwanza","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.516667 32.9","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-01-18T18:00:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mariam","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-30T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-03-31T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-06-29T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-07-29T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-10-27T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-03-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:53:03Z","rounded_local_amount":52500,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130717},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:57:55Z","rounded_local_amount":52500,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130718},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:27:15Z","rounded_local_amount":52500,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027510},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-05-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:16:24Z","rounded_local_amount":52500,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613511},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-06-29T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:03:27Z","rounded_local_amount":52500,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010590},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-07-29T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:40:03Z","rounded_local_amount":52500,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63232877},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-08-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:53:58Z","rounded_local_amount":52500,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73664678},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-09-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T02:47:53Z","rounded_local_amount":52500,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87105409},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-10-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T06:28:34Z","rounded_local_amount":52500,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97022554},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-11-26T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:42:29Z","rounded_local_amount":52500,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103867803}],"funded_date":"2009-01-18T19:31:52Z","paid_date":"2009-12-15T14:42:29Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":88469,"name":"Flaviano","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Flaviano G. is a \"nipa\" maker, that is, a woven roof which is composed of a very light material from the \"nipa\" plant. \"Nipa\" in the Philippines is used to roof houses; it is an an aquatic plant and is popular in the country.

She is married and has 1 child infant-aged children.  To make a living, Mouena owns & operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising crops.  While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from planting & harvesting taro for sale.  Mouena has been engaged in this business for over 7 years and earns approximately $600 WST a month from these activities.\n\nIn 2008, Mouena joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve  her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Mouena has successfully repaid a previous loan of $1000 WST from SPBD.  This previous loan was used to purchase harvesting equipment.  Mouena is now requesting a new loan of $1500 WST which will be used to purchase fertilizers such as manure.  The loan will be the 2nd loan taken out by the borrower from SPBD.  Mouena plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business  to improve\/expand the borrower's business.\n\nAbout SPBD:\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.\n\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva

the outskirts of Guayaquil that has running water, electricity, drainage, and paved streets.  Six years ago she decided to set up a store in her home so that she could have time to spend with her two daughters.  She works from 8am until 9pm; her 13-year-old daughter helps her with the store.  Zhanny buys frozen treats at $0.30 and she sells them at $0.50 each; notebooks at $0.70 and sells them at $1.20 each and sweets at $0.10 that she sells at $0.15.  One of her obstacles is when she gets sick, although this is rare, she has to go on.  Her husband helps with household expenses; he's an ice-cream peddler, but even so her economic situation is unstable.  Her 4-year-old isn't in school yet and her 13-year-old is in private school, but on scholarship.  With the funding she wants to buy $300 worth of frozen treats and $200 worth of sweets.  Her goal for the future is to enlarge her business so that she can improve her house, which still needs lighting and fencing.  She would also like to see her daughter graduate from secondary school.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":449348,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Frozen treats and sweets.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Guayaquil (Isla)","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":147,"posted_date":"2009-12-15T19:10:22Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":500,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Zhanny Nuve","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-12-03T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":35.09},{"due_date":"2010-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":36.8},{"due_date":"2010-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":38.79},{"due_date":"2010-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":38.72},{"due_date":"2010-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2010-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":40.73},{"due_date":"2010-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":41.98},{"due_date":"2010-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":42.83},{"due_date":"2010-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":43.92},{"due_date":"2010-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":45.15},{"due_date":"2010-11-05T07:00:00Z","amount":46.19},{"due_date":"2010-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":49.8}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.09},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.8},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.79},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.72},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.73},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.98},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.83},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.92},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.15},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.19},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.8}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":35.09,"local_amount":35.09,"processed_date":"2010-01-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:33:13Z","rounded_local_amount":35.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118074047},{"amount":36.8,"local_amount":36.8,"processed_date":"2010-02-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:07:03Z","rounded_local_amount":36.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123910014},{"amount":38.79,"local_amount":38.79,"processed_date":"2010-03-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T08:59:56Z","rounded_local_amount":38.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128945579},{"amount":38.72,"local_amount":38.72,"processed_date":"2010-04-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:17:40Z","rounded_local_amount":38.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136673942},{"amount":40,"local_amount":40,"processed_date":"2010-05-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:16:10Z","rounded_local_amount":40,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144708105},{"amount":40.73,"local_amount":40.73,"processed_date":"2010-06-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:46:05Z","rounded_local_amount":40.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151891313},{"amount":41.98,"local_amount":41.98,"processed_date":"2010-07-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:09:39Z","rounded_local_amount":41.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159631585},{"amount":86.75,"local_amount":86.75,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:14:29Z","rounded_local_amount":86.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166845481},{"amount":45.15,"local_amount":45.15,"processed_date":"2010-10-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T13:54:58Z","rounded_local_amount":45.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177405200},{"amount":46.19,"local_amount":46.19,"processed_date":"2010-11-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T14:04:00Z","rounded_local_amount":46.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182543701},{"amount":49.8,"local_amount":49.8,"processed_date":"2010-12-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T13:07:59Z","rounded_local_amount":49.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188680489}],"funded_date":"2009-12-15T21:14:50Z","paid_date":"2011-01-15T13:07:59Z","journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":166578,"name":"Sokhatile","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Madame Sokhatile D. est une femme de 71 ans qui vit dans le quartier de Mbenguene dans la localit\u00e9 de Yoff.

I Made Wirya has been in this business for over eight years and earns approximately 875,000 Indonesian rupiah (IDR) a month. His favorite part of the job is feeding the cows because it makes him feel at peace.

I Made Wirya is requesting his first loan from MUK. He is requesting a loan of 10,000,000 IDR which will be used to purchase livestock feed and other supplies. I Made Wirya plans to use additional revenue to improve and expand his business.\r\n\r\n<b>About MUK<\/b>\r\nThe mission of Koperasi Mitra Usaha Kecil (MUK) is to assist small businesses in Bali by providing training, business consultation and loans, thereby helping the owners and their families improve their everyday lives.\r\n\r\nI Made Wirya 0 (0) merupakan 53 tahun pria.

I Made Wirya berencana untuk menggunakan pendapatan tambahan yang dihasilkan dari bisnis  untuk meningkatkan\/memperluas bisnis peminjam.\r\n\r\nTentang MUK:\r\nMisi Koperasi Mitra Usaha Kecil (MUK) adalah untuk membantu usaha kecil di Bali dengan memberikan perlatihan, konsultasi bisnis, dan pinjaman uang, dengan demikian membantu pemilik usaha dan keluarga mereka memperbaiki hidup sehari-hari.\r\n\r\nPesan untuk Peminjam Kiva: Grup ini memakai model pinjaman komunitas\/\"\"community lending\"\" (biasanya dijuluk Bank Desa\/\"\"Village Banking\"\") yang populer di Asia. Di model ini, sejumlah representatif dari grup akan meminjam uang sejumlah lebih besar untuk seluruh grup (kadang-kadang seluruh desa). Representatif ini akan distribusi dan mengendalikan pinjaman, dan mengkoleksi pembayaran untuk peminjam akhir. Ini adalah praktek umum dan efisien di daerah ini, tapi merumitkan cara lapor untuk Kiva. Tidak serupa pinjaman lain, partner Kiva, MUK, akan menjadi kontak utama dengan tim kepemimpinan grup, yang sebaliknya menjadi kontak dengan peminjam akhir. Demikian, jurnal yang ditulis akan merefleksikan hasilnya tim kepemimpinan, bukannya peminjam-peminjam akhir.\r\n\r\n\r\nUntuk belajari lebih banyak tentang Village Banking di Wikipedia, mohon

Isha is forty years of age. She was born in Kono, in Eastern Sierra Leone. She is currently residing in Makeni, together with her husband who is a soldier. The two have five children \u2013 two of them are already on their own and three are still going to school. Isha sells cloth \u2013 cottons, \u201cwax\u201d and \u201claise\u201d (\"laise\" are usually more expensive cloth than cotton and \"wax\"). Isha has been in the business for over twelve years.<P>\r\n\r\nWith this loan, Isha will add to her initial working capital to buy additional bales of cloth. She will buy a bale of cotton and a bale of \"laise\". A bale of cotton costs Le 1,400,000 and a bale of \"laise\" costs Le 1,800,000. She will have to travel to neighboring Guinea to buy these bales of cloth. Prices in Guinea are more reasonable than in Sierra Leone. The cost to and from Guinea is Le 100,000.  <P>\r\n\r\nThe major challenges for Isa in her business are that of occasional slow sales and high customs duties at the border post. Apart from these, everything in her business is going fine.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets. Women are considered non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This situation leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that it allows clients to use their equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":269785,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To purchase maize, beans, and rice in bulk.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbeya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.9 33.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-02-12T00:10:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":625,"lender_count":4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Neema J.

She is an active and responsible woman, but unlucky in marriage. She got married once but was divorced because she and her husband did not get along well. She single-handedly raises up her son. Thus, she faces many difficulties, as she does not only have to worry about finances but also shoulders the responsibility of being both a mother and a father for her son. Everyday, besides working on the farm and rearing pigs, she also does carpenter works at home to increase income. Her average daily income is about 80,000 to 100,000VND. Though facing hardship, she was still able to repay well her previous loan. This time, she would like to borrow 4,704,000VND over the course of 50 weeks to rear pigs. Her group also consists of:\r\n<li> Mrs. N. Thi Hang, borrows 2,016,000VND to purchase bran for pigs. <\/li>\r\n<li> Mrs. N.

","en":"Hilda is 58 years old, is from Iquitos (a city in the Peruvian jungle), and lives with her partner who is a mechanic and her sons Goldi, 39, and Henry, 37 in a home she owns.  Since she was 25 years old she has been working in sewing.  She likes very much to make clothing with her sewing machine and she puts all her ingenuity and creativity into each garment.  Around her neighborhood her services are in high demand, because she is very good at her work, and obtains good earnings for her household.  But this business has sporadic demand, and Hilda would like an occupation that would generate daily earnings, and this is why she had the idea to invest in a restaurant which would offer a large number of dishes.\r\n\r\nThanks to her efforts, she managed to find an appropriate location for her new business and to rent and buy that which is necessary for getting started.  Hilda has placed great hope in this enterprise, trusting in her good timing and business instincts, but also continuing working on that which she likes the most, which is making clothing.  \r\n\r\nThis is her 14th loan with Microfinanzas PRISMA, and she is currently forming a group with two of her friends who work well together, to be punctual in their payments.  With the money she is asking for she will buy furniture and utensils for starting her restaurant.  She is hoping for a very prosperous future.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Donna Yates, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":291273,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Restaurant","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Investment in a new food sales business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-03-22T20:20:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":650,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hilda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-03-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":211.58},{"due_date":"2009-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":226.9},{"due_date":"2009-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":229.6},{"due_date":"2009-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":244.7},{"due_date":"2009-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":254.05},{"due_date":"2009-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":265.87},{"due_date":"2009-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":279.11},{"due_date":"2009-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":288.19}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.76},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.74},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.62},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.53},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.57},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.41},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":90.71},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":93.66}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":68.76,"local_amount":211.58,"processed_date":"2009-04-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:44:43Z","rounded_local_amount":216.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36012272},{"amount":76.81,"local_amount":236.34,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T01:01:51Z","rounded_local_amount":241.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44595854},{"amount":71.55,"local_amount":220.16,"processed_date":"2009-06-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:39:32Z","rounded_local_amount":225.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52990121},{"amount":79.53,"local_amount":244.7,"processed_date":"2009-07-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:41:28Z","rounded_local_amount":250.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63211247},{"amount":82.57,"local_amount":254.05,"processed_date":"2009-08-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:20:19Z","rounded_local_amount":259.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73640757},{"amount":86.41,"local_amount":265.87,"processed_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:43:44Z","rounded_local_amount":271.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87080221},{"amount":90.71,"local_amount":279.11,"processed_date":"2009-10-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:04:41Z","rounded_local_amount":285.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96996485},{"amount":93.66,"local_amount":288.19,"processed_date":"2009-11-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:54:12Z","rounded_local_amount":294.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103841993}],"funded_date":"2009-03-22T23:56:49Z","paid_date":"2009-12-15T13:54:12Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Donna Yates","image":146613}},{"id":100773,"name":"Arubaine C Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. H.

She rises early to open her store and knows that her customers need her products in the morning more than at any other time; she sells food and other items necessary for the home.  The most enjoyable thing about her job is to discuss neighborhood news with her customers.  She has operated her store for ten years and considers the most difficult part of her job that she must remain in the store the entire day and may not go outside into the street or do other things.  She hopes that her business will grow and become the most important store in her neighborhood.  This is Elsa's seventh loan with Microfinanzas PRISMA.  She has been very punctual with her payments and expects to continue to be so.  In her cooperative bank, she is very active and well-liked by the other members.  With the $700 she has applied for, she will increase the number of products that she has in stock.  She wishes to offer greater variety to her customers.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jeff Schell, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":370530,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Increase of merchandise","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Juliaca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15.5 -70.133333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-08-18T02:40:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":700,"lender_count":27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elsa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-07-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":333},{"due_date":"2009-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":333},{"due_date":"2009-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":333},{"due_date":"2009-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":333},{"due_date":"2009-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":333},{"due_date":"2010-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":335}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.55},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.55},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":116.55},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":116.55},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":116.55},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":117.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":116.55,"local_amount":333,"processed_date":"2009-08-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:23:02Z","rounded_local_amount":341.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73641712},{"amount":116.55,"local_amount":333,"processed_date":"2009-09-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:36:14Z","rounded_local_amount":341.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87081164},{"amount":116.55,"local_amount":333,"processed_date":"2009-10-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:06:52Z","rounded_local_amount":341.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96997315},{"amount":116.55,"local_amount":333,"processed_date":"2009-11-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:54:26Z","rounded_local_amount":341.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103842659},{"amount":233.8,"local_amount":668,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T21:07:29Z","rounded_local_amount":685.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734241}],"funded_date":"2009-08-18T18:53:51Z","paid_date":"2010-01-15T21:07:29Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jeff Schell","image":null}},{"id":133576,"name":"Julian's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"K.

Sidoine has lived in Cocotomey, in the village of Abomey Calavi, for 15 years.  Married to Salomon Gonsaves, a shipping agent, Sidoine is the mother of one child who attends school.  Sidoine has one other child in her care. Together, she and her husband meet the different family responsibilities.  Sidoine attended very little school, and she learned hairstyling. This is the type of work Sidoine has been doing for about 15 years and it allows her to meet her needs.  Along with this work, she sells hairpieces, jewelry and various other beauty products at her shop in Cococodji, in the village of Abomey Calavi.  Sidoine buys her products in Dantokpa, the international market of B\u00e9nin.  She has already benefitted once before with a loan through ALID\u00e9, a loan which she has repaid.  Sidoine is requesting a second loan to increase the level of her business and to satisfy her customers better.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Shannon Arnold, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":512059,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty Salon","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to buy hairpieces and jewelry","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BJ","country":"Benin","town":"Cotonou Agence principale","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"9.5 2.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":104,"posted_date":"2010-03-25T18:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":300,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sidoine ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-04-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":140000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":14000},{"due_date":"2010-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":14000},{"due_date":"2010-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":14000},{"due_date":"2010-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":14000},{"due_date":"2010-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":14000},{"due_date":"2010-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":14000},{"due_date":"2010-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":14000},{"due_date":"2010-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":14000},{"due_date":"2011-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":14000},{"due_date":"2011-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":14000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":30,"local_amount":14000,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T08:40:32Z","rounded_local_amount":14519.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144653297},{"amount":30,"local_amount":14000,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-20T07:28:48Z","rounded_local_amount":14519.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151835504},{"amount":30,"local_amount":14000,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T09:10:01Z","rounded_local_amount":14519.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159575901},{"amount":30,"local_amount":14000,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-30T08:14:43Z","rounded_local_amount":14519.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166954415},{"amount":30,"local_amount":14000,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-28T09:52:03Z","rounded_local_amount":14519.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172056073},{"amount":112.29,"local_amount":52400,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-03T10:26:04Z","rounded_local_amount":54343.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177347607},{"amount":5.57,"local_amount":2600,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T11:57:28Z","rounded_local_amount":2696.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182482676},{"amount":2.14,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-26T09:06:20Z","rounded_local_amount":1037.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191360929},{"amount":30,"local_amount":14000,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-28T09:13:22Z","rounded_local_amount":14519.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195779620}],"funded_date":"2010-03-29T12:56:38Z","paid_date":"2011-03-28T09:13:22Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Shannon Arnold","image":null}},{"id":191760,"name":"Chhlat","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. P., 26, resides in a small wooden house with other family members.

They have three children who are 11 to 20 years old. \r\n\r\nGenie joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2006 because she aspired for something better for her family.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to epic mountain passes, a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC, and communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still lives in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He is an ever smiling youthful 22-year-old farmer from Endebes, a remote village in the Kitale area of Kenya. Paul is elegant and admirable in spirit and effort. He is a role model, a mentor, and an inspiration to many young farmers in his village because of his resilience despite personal challenges and his passion to support his parents and siblings as a primary source of income. The living conditions in the Endebes, Kitale area are very tough and one needs to have tough skin in order to survive. Paul has always shown the resilience to beat all odds. Because of the hardcore poverty in his village, Paul started practicing mixed farming and has been doing it for the past 3 years. Paul's sources of income are from producing vegetables, maize, and eggs. These products are very perishable and require timely delivery to the market, which is a problem for Paul. The Endebes area has a poor road network and poor feeder roads that really hamper timely delivery of products to the market. Paul with great humility is kindly seeking a loan to buy a motorbike. With the motorbike he will deliver products to the market on time and reap more profits because the products will still be fresh. Paul is very determined to succeed, and because he is much disciplined with finances, he plans to accumulate profits to provide a secure future for himself and for his parents and siblings. Paul's dream is to provide a secure future for his siblings. Through your loan you will help him realize his dream. Paul promises to make his payments punctually and is thankful to all those who will support him in acquiring the motorbike, all he can tell them is \"Thank

She also has another business, which is animation for children's parties, which she primarily does with great joy on the weekends.  Rosario loves children, and for her they are beings full of energy that transmit joy and a thirst for life, unlike adults who are always worried and serious.  This is why her work always tends to have something to do with children.<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\nRosario wants, in the future, to have more candy shops near the other four schools in the area to be able to create jobs for other people, as well as a better income for her family.

This is 24-year-old Rosemary Mshumbus from Mwannza. She is married and supports one dependent who is an orphan. Rosemary has run a beauty saloon since 2008 -- a place where customers can come to buy long hair, short hair, curly hair, straight hair, or hair in various colors, and then have it attached to their heads, woven, cut, or braided so that it looks like their own. She works at her business for seven hours per day, seven days per week, and earns about $240 a month. She is requesting a loan of $400 to buy hair, weaves and other items. In the future, she plans to expand her business. Rosemary thanks you for your support!\r\n\r\nABOUT SELFINA!\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":350619,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty Salon","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"To buy hair and other items for a beauty parlor.

Akram is a good father, hard working, and steadfast in his endeavors as a farmer and in raising animals. Thanks to his wife\u2019s assistance (pictured), he is able to care and feed the animals for sale later at both fairs and marketplaces in nearby towns. Traveling to nearby towns increases his costs, but that is offset by the higher asking price he gets there. For this reason, Akram and his wife take care to feed them properly in order to bring in more profit. Nevertheless, they would now like to increase the number of cattle. In order to buy cattle he needs a loan of $1500 USD and promises to be responsible and prompt in repaying it.  \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is highly appreciated and sought-after by her customers. She aims to use her loan in order to purchase sewing and embroidery thread, needs and other materials necessary for her work.

She is currently separated from her spouse. The zone where she lives is an agricultural zone that mainly produces mango, lemon and passion fruit. It belongs to the Piura province and is located in the region of the same name, more than three hours from the city of Chiclayo, the capital of the Lambayeque region. Grimaneza sells basic staples and clothing items in a small store in her home. The business has allowed her to get her family ahead during this time. She makes an effort every day to make the store succeed, offering good service and quality products to her customers. Thanks to this, she has become known in the area and her establishment always has loyal customers. Grimaneza wants to expand her store with the purchase of more basic staples in order to increase her sales and make more income, which will allow her to get her family ahead. For this reason she has decided to request her first loan, 1000 soles, with Edyme Alternativa. She is a hard-working woman who gives all of herself to get her children ahead. Those who know her in the area where she lives consider her to be a calm and reliable woman.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Christine Cooper, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":603748,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"The purchase of basic staples and groceries to expand the store in her home","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Tambogrande -
