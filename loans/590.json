This bank is made up of a group of members who have their dreams and the strength to get ahead, showing their children the value of work and the way of improving themselves every day. This bank is in the Cumbe parish, a place that is privileged with its livestock and farming produce.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda lives in the 3 de Noviembre suburb in the Cumbe parish. She is a happy and charismatic member of the bank and she gets on well all her fellow members. She is 41 and married. In her married union she has had 5 children who are 23, 21, 19, 15, and 12. Her first child works in a factory called Indurama and he does not financially help in the living expenses. Her second child works in a hardware store and her salary is for her personal expenses. Her third child helps in the home because he still has not found work and her other two are still students. Her husband works as a truck driver and it is their greatest pride to be able to have their own home.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda has raised animals since she was very young. She has cows, chickens and guinea pigs. Her cows' milk is taken by the milk trucks and she sells her chickens and guinea pigs to her neighbours in the community or when she has some financial need.\r\n\r\nShe has been making use of the foundation's loans for 11 years and became a member because she heard an announcement over a loadspeaker in her community. She has used the loans for the education of her children and now with the new loan she is going to buy chickens, guinea pigs and their feed such as grass, nutritional feed and maize.\r\n\r\nHer aim is to build a shed to raise more hens to expand her farm.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Catherine Dent, Kiva

She plans to use this loan to invest in her business by buying rice, flour and other foods. She will use the profits to invest in her business. \r\n\r\nThis Esperanza associate began with us because she needed capital for her business. Her story is representative of her group and of Esperanza's Haitian and Dominican (many of whom recently emigrated to the DR from Haiti) clients generally. Her group is located in San Pedro de Macoris, a city famous for baseball players and sugar cane industries. The main economic activities are free trading zone and a cement factory. This area, like nearly all impoverished areas in the Dominican Republic, suffers from unreliable running water (none of which is potable) and electricity.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3725,"image":{"id":651284,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

She is doing all she can to achieve just that. One effort to reach this goal is to have a means of sustainability. Thus, Lourdes joined CCT* as a community partner, and, with the entrepreneurial learning she gains there, she is able to run her own small business. Lourdes is married to Rolando, who is a water tender. They have a child who is now in high school.\r\n\r\nLourdes directly sells beauty products, such as local brands M.S.E., Natasha, and Board Walk,  and other accessories to friends, neighbors, and business connections. She also sells silver jewelry chosen for her clients' tastes. Rolando, on the other hand, makes money by delivering gallons of water to the homes of fellow community members with the use of his side car. Their monthly family income reaches around Php10,000.\r\n\r\nTo help grow her business, Lourdes decided to ask for a Php14,000 loan. She intends to use this loan money to purchase her own stock of products, accessories, and jewelry items for sale. She needs enough money on hand to buy her customers' orders even before their initial payments. The loan money, Lourdes says, increases her capacity to earn and helps to augment the needs of her family.\r\n\r\nOne major problem she faces is the fact that some customers do not pay on time. Lourdes takes the responsibility of paying for the sold item. But Lourdes is willing and ready to face whatever challenge lies ahead, just for their lives to be sustained and be in order. She commits herself to financing the studies of her child until she sees this child graduate from college.

In spite of their age, Juana tells us that they are very responsible and help her in caring for her crops.  Juana has been in this business for 16 years and, as she is a good farmer, she spends most of her day amongst her potato and vegetable crops.  She tells us that every harvest time they provide her with good profits as she travels to the central market in the capital where she sells them wholesale.  However, during periods of lower production, the retailers in her town buy her crops at a lower price.  This bothers her a lot.  However, she does not lose heart.  On the contrary, it gives her the strength to get ahead.  On Wednesdays and Sundays she sells meat from sheep in the wholesale market in town.  This makes her additional money.\r\n\r\nJuana belongs to the 'Miraflores de Casacoto' community bank and this is her fourth loan from MFP.

For the past six years she has made a living baking artisan bread. Her mother taught her this trade. She was a widow and had to raise Ver\u00f3nica and her three siblings on her own, so she taught her children how to fend for themselves and get ahead in life. They made tamales and pupusas before her father died. To buy the materials she needs to make her products, such as corn, flour, cheese and other items, Ver\u00f3nica has to travel to the city once a week, boarding a bus that takes five hours round trip from her house. She is requesting the loan from Kiva partner Fundaci\u00f3n Campo to purchase the ingredients she needs to fulfill the orders she has in her community. Her demand is really high since her handmade products, such as quesadillas, tortas and cupcakes, are uncommon. She bakes the bread and goes out to sell it door to door through the community three times a week. With the loan, she hopes to earn more profits and in this way she can help her husband with household expenses like food, health and education, and pay for medicine for her son, who is sick and has costly treatments, and right now their income isn't enough to cover it. Ver\u00f3nica wants to save what she makes from increasing her production to help her husband buy a lot and build a home, since they live in the house of one of her spouse's relatives.

In search of income sources for his family, he started his own animal husbandry and farming business in 2002.  He grows potatoes, corn and wheat on three hectares of arable land, and also has three heads of cattle and five sheep.  Thanks to Sarybay's tenacity and persistence, his business yields from 5,000 to 25,000 som (KGS) per season today.  He also provides a taxi service during the off-season.  In order to further expand his business, Sarybay requested a loan in the sum of 50,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company to purchase wheat and potato seeds, treat land and purchase mineral fertilizers.  He plans to invest the profit from this loan into building a more comfortable and spacious barn and building a fence.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":946710,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase seeds and fertilizers ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Kyrgyz-Ata village, Osh region","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2011-12-16T23:10:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1075,"lender_count":41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sarybay","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-12-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1075}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":1075,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T12:02:25Z","rounded_local_amount":50103.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331070926}],"funded_date":"2012-01-19T02:04:02Z","paid_date":"2013-01-15T12:02:25Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Anna Sorokina","image":null}},{"id":375316,"name":"Rosalita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rosalita is a married woman and has two children.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Baptist Model Secondary School was established by the Baptist mission primarily to educate the children of Allen town and its environs. The school is staffed with fifty teachers and has 2,100 pupils.\r\n\r\nThese hard-working and dedicated teachers have come to SMT to seek a loan of SLL 7,400,000. With the help of this loan, these teachers can embark on some meaningful project that their mere salaries alone cannot do. Some of them will use the loan to buy pieces of furniture, others to buy house building materials, buy a piece of land or pay school fees for their children, while some of them will invest the loan in a business. \r\n\r\nJohn A. B. is the leader of this group of teachers. He is age thirty-eight. Abu is married and has two children. Mr. B. will use part of his share of the loan to pay school fees for his children and will use the remainder of the loan to pay school fees for himself to pursue further studies. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1900,"image":{"id":584856,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Primary\/secondary school costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Conflict Zones"],"use":" pay school fees for his children and  for himself ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SL","country":"Sierra Leone","town":"Waterloo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"8.5 -11.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":57,"posted_date":"2010-08-20T01:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1900,"lender_count":67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"John A.

She lives in Purok Palasan, Brgy. Pilar, Hinigaran, Negros Occidental. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2002 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts.\r\n\r\nBy working hard in her general store business, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 8,000. Rosene is now borrowing PHP 12,000, so that she can purchase more stock to sell.  This will be her 10th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 20,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Rosene aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams.

Chill\u00e1n es conocida como \u201cCuna de la Patria\u201d o \u201cTierra de Artistas\u201d, debido a que en la ciudad han nacido destacados personajes de la historia de Chile, como por ejemplo el conocido pianista Claudio Arrau.\n","en":"This communal bank is called \"Looking at the Future\" and is composed by 17 members who are dedicated to differing activities, among them the making of empanadas, tortillas, sale of firewood and coal, also sale of groceries in a mini market.  They are all from the city of Chilan.  Nancy, who in the picture is in the first row, second from the right, is dressed in a black jacket, pink polo shirt and boots on top of her jeans.  She has been a seamstress for the last 21 years, and has a shop in her home. \r\nNancy makes her clothing based on the season and the orders she receives from her customers.  Her customers are frequently students during the school season, for the independence holiday season (Chilean independence day festivities) her clothing is based on native folk attire.  Starting with the month of August her sales increase due to the making, renting and selling of costumes.  In her shop Nancy has the necessary machinery to carry out her craft, an overlock machine, a multipoint and a straight machine.  She says that her sales are doing well. \r\nShe buys her supplies in stores that specialize in sewing supplies.  \r\nWith the loan she will buy material, elastic, thread and sequins, specifically supplies to make costumes.\r\nHer goals are to continue working in her business to increase her income.  She would like to perfect her ability to make costumes and she wishes to have a store specializing in the sale and rental of these.\r\nNancy lives with her husband and two children of 11 and 13 years of age.  Her dreams for her family are for her children to become independent and professionals.  She also finds herself helping her husband with the start of a grocery store business.\r\nNancy is very happy and grateful with the help that she gets from the Esperanza Fund.  She says that the meetings have been a way to meet and share experiences from different point of view.  This way confidence and solidarity is generated with the other member of the communal bank group.  Besides, the group is very caring and committed.  \r\nChill\u00e1n is a community in the south central area of Chile.  The name means \" seat of the sun\" in mapudungun, the language of the indigenous Mapuches.  Chill\u00e1n is known as the \"cradle of the country\" or \"land of artists\", due to several famous persons in Chile's history being born there, as for example the known pianist Claudio Arrau.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2550,"image":{"id":796815,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Tailoring","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to

She is now 32 years old and lives with her husband and 1-year-old daughter in Bayanhongor province, one of Mongolia's central provinces. Her husband currently stays home and takes care of the baby.\r\n\r\nSelenge used to mine for gold by hand like many locals do at the gold-mining site. She gave up the dirty mining and decided to sell clothes at the local market. Since July 2008, she has been renting a small stall at the local black market and retailing women\u2019s and men\u2019s clothes. She purchases inventory clothes from China, where many of cheap products flood into the country and resells them at her stall. She hopes to expand her business and rent one more stall to sell more clothes.\r\n\r\nSelenge requests a loan to purchase more inventory for her retail business.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>About XacBank:<\/b>\r\nXacBank was founded in 2001, and listed its first loan on Kiva in January 2009.

G. is a 48-year-old married woman who lives in Nangka, Bayawan City, Negros Oriental. She earns her living by running a rice retailing business.\r\n\r\nHer husband, Ricardo, is 51 years old and works driving a habal habal (a single motorcycle that is the only mode of transportation in most  mountainous areas). They have two children who are 20 and 21 years old.  One works as a delivery boy and the other helps her parents in their business.\r\n\r\nRosemarie joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2002 in the hope that she would be able to help her husband improve their family's quality of life. With the help of her loans from NWTF-PD she has been able to increase their family income by engaging in the rice retailing business. Now she earns an average monthly income of $326 from her business activities.\r\n\r\nRosemarie is a member in good standing. Her previous loan of 19,500 PHP was used to fund the operations of her rice retailing business, and it had a positive impact on both the business and the family\u2019s living conditions. Now she is on her 15th cycle loan, in the amount of 23,000 PHP, which she intends to use as additional working capital for her rice retailing business. Rosemarie is working hard to achieve her dreams and aspirations for her family, which is to provide them with a brighter future and a more comfortable life.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress out of earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest

It's in the province of the same name and in the Libertad region, over an hour away from the city of Chiclayo, capital of the Lambayeque region.  \r\n\r\nHe offers transportation services to passengers and cargo with his mototaxi (a motorized vehicle consisting of a motorcycle with a compartment for the purpose of transportation).  He offers this service in the district where he lives and, thanks to the income it generates, he covers his personal costs and helps support his family.  This business is in high demand in the area and is relatively economical and quick.  \r\n\r\nContant use during the time he has been working with his vehicle has meant that the vehicle has begun having several problems and needs constant maintenance to keep it working.  This is why he is requesting from Edpyme Alternative a loan of 1500 nuevos soles.  Carlos is an honest person and very hardworking.  His dearest wish is to continue working hard to be able to take care of his parents and give them a better quality of life.  He worked previously with Nuestra Institucion and showed punctuality and responsibility for achieving his quotas.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Nadine Riopel, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":593328,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Rickshaw","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"Repair and maintenance costs for a mototaxi","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Chep\u00e9n, La Libertad","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":143,"posted_date":"2010-08-31T19:00:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Carlos Enrique","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-08-04T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":104.74},{"due_date":"2010-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":106.6},{"due_date":"2010-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":111.55},{"due_date":"2010-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":115.15},{"due_date":"2011-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":117.72},{"due_date":"2011-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":121.65},{"due_date":"2011-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":128.38},{"due_date":"2011-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":129.23},{"due_date":"2011-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":135.52},{"due_date":"2011-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":138.81},{"due_date":"2011-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":143.44},{"due_date":"2011-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":147.21}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.4},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39.09},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.9},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.22},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.17},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.6},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.08},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.38},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.69},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.9},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.59},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.98}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":38.4,"local_amount":104.74,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T09:56:37Z","rounded_local_amount":107.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172099628},{"amount":39.09,"local_amount":106.6,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-16T10:43:38Z","rounded_local_amount":109.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177555004},{"amount":40.9,"local_amount":111.55,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T13:46:58Z","rounded_local_amount":114.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182530398},{"amount":42.22,"local_amount":115.15,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T12:54:51Z","rounded_local_amount":118.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188666523},{"amount":43.17,"local_amount":117.72,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T02:54:32Z","rounded_local_amount":120.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191409848},{"amount":44.6,"local_amount":121.65,"processed_date":"2011-02-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T08:31:23Z","rounded_local_amount":124.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":196108281},{"amount":301.62,"local_amount":822.59,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T10:48:44Z","rounded_local_amount":843.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201270417}],"funded_date":"2010-09-01T16:16:06Z","paid_date":"2011-04-15T10:48:44Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Nadine Riopel","image":496782}},{"id":231888,"name":"Benjamin Kiprotich","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Benjamin Kiprotich M. is a 32-year-old man who is married to Ursila Jepchirchir.

Zenaida Requentosa, 47, is one kind of a typical mother. She was not able to go to high school, but because she is a community partner in CCT*, she receives entrepreneurial training and biblical encouragement to help her start and run her own business. Zeny, as she is called by friends, is the wife of Rodrigo, a mason, and the loving mother of three children who are all in high school.  They live in Baseco, Manila.\r\n\r\nZeny runs a business in which balut (fertilized duck egg with an undeveloped embryo) is made and sold to the community. Balut is a common food in the country and is often sought after at night. Zeny capitalizes on this big market and produces quality balut. She also adds fish and pork crackers, which are the best accompaniment for balut. Zeny has been in this business for seven years  and earns around Php12,000 every month.\r\n\r\nTo help her grow her business, Zenaida seeks a Php17, 000 loan. She intends to use this to improve her balut-making business\u2014buying quality ingredients, paying hired men, and other business expenses. She is sure that the loan will increase the profitability of her business and will help finance the schooling of her three children.\r\n\r\nZenaida worries about the financial stability of her family.  There are times when the balut sales are low, and some customers who borrow do not pay. Nevertheless, she does not give up hoping and believing that her business will grow, and that it will be God\u2019s way of blessing her family with a life of peace and good health.\r\n\r\nAs a CCT community partner, she faithfully attends the group's weekly fellowship* meeting where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she received.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance loans.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":719935,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Balut-Making","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To purchase more raw balut eggs for selling ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Baseco, Manila","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2011-02-25T20:30:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Zenaida","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-02-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":17000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1133.33},{"due_date":"2011-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":1133.33},{"due_date":"2011-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1133.33},{"due_date":"2011-03-29T07:00:00Z","amount":1133.33},{"due_date":"2011-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1133.33},{"due_date":"2011-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1133.33},{"due_date":"2011-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1133.33},{"due_date":"2011-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":1133.33},{"due_date":"2011-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1133.33},{"due_date":"2011-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1133.33},{"due_date":"2011-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1133.33},{"due_date":"2011-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1133.33},{"due_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","amount":1133.33},{"due_date":"2011-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":1133.33},{"due_date":"2011-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1133.38}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.67},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.66},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.67},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.67},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.66},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.67},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.67},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.66},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.67},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.67},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.66},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.67},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.67},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.66},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":106.67,"local_amount":4533.32,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T10:37:49Z","rounded_local_amount":4660.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201256848},{"amount":106.66,"local_amount":4533.32,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T10:33:51Z","rounded_local_amount":4660.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206123541},{"amount":133.34,"local_amount":5666.65,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T10:49:34Z","rounded_local_amount":5825.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211194862},{"amount":53.33,"local_amount":2266.71,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T10:43:18Z","rounded_local_amount":2330.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216474000}],"funded_date":"2011-02-25T22:55:46Z","paid_date":"2011-07-15T10:43:18Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Juliet Nagle","image":null}},{"id":281063,"name":"Julio Cesar","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Julio Cesar es un hombre muy trabajador y ha demostrado ser un excelente cliente.

She is a cheerful, friendly and enterprising woman. She lives with her spouse, with whom she has three children aged 20, 17 and 12 years old. The oldest is independent and with his own family, while the two youngest still depend on her and her spouse to have a good education. She lives in her own house where she shares her days with her spouse who also works a lot to offer a better quality of life to their family. Disnarda's job is selling all types of bread, beverages and ice cream flavored with regional fruit, of which there are many because of the intense heat in the area. She sells all of the products in her house, where her customers go. On the other hand she works for some people harvesting citrus, which generates additional income for the home. She has been doing these activities for three years and she started by selling a little, and now her business has stabilized. She loves working like this, since she managed her own schedule and generates income for her family. She has a lot of plans for the future, but at this time she just wants to consolidate her work and in the future expand her business. This will be her first loan with MFP. She is very excited to know that they will offer her financial backing in order to start to invest more in her business. She is very committed to making her payments on time and be able to integrate quickly into the communal bank, since it is a very solid and above all responsible group.

He has been able to support his family by learning how to manage his crops in the short growing season. To illustrate, he grows crops such as wheat, onions, potatoes, tomatoes, and cucumbers.  Each year his yield is sufficient to meet his family's consumption needs and to sell crops for a profit. The business is the main source of his family's income, yet generating a stable income requires considerable funding. <p>\r\nThus, now Ruziboy would like to purchase mineral fertilizers and seeds for planting, so he is seeking a loan in the amount of $1,000 over a 6-month term. With the loan proceeds, Ruziboy would buy supplies for the harvest and to improve production so that he can increase the quality of his yield and his earnings in turn. After making a good profit from his business, he is planning to send his younger son to the University because he recently finished school. With your help, this will be possible, so he thanks everyone for supporting him and promises to repay the loan on time."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":176912,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To increase and improve his crop yield by purchasing additional seeds and mineral fertilizers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Istaravshan","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39.910833 69.006389","type":"point"}},"partner_id":100,"posted_date":"2008-07-14T00:30:12Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ruziboy","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-07-30T02:52:54Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-08-29T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2008-09-29T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2008-10-29T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2008-11-29T08:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2008-12-29T08:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2009-01-29T08:00:00Z","amount":166.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":166.65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":167,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2008-08-16T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T03:42:31Z","rounded_local_amount":167,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":298183},{"amount":167,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2008-09-16T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-09-17T07:13:03Z","rounded_local_amount":167,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":328767},{"amount":167,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2008-10-16T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-17T07:13:55Z","rounded_local_amount":167,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":362713},{"amount":332.35,"local_amount":332.35,"processed_date":"2008-12-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-15T23:44:55Z","rounded_local_amount":332.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9943351},{"amount":166.65,"local_amount":166.65,"processed_date":"2009-01-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T13:13:54Z","rounded_local_amount":166.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":10220437}],"funded_date":"2008-07-16T02:52:54Z","paid_date":"2009-02-15T13:13:54Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":58969,"name":"Martha's Mercy Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Martha C. is 25  years old.

She really likes working with her Community Bank, Estrella Azul, because all of them are good friends.\r\n\r\nShe will use the money she is asking for to buy a greater quantity of clothes for the winter season.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":357638,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"Increase merchandise","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-07-24T03:10:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Zenayda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-07-09T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2009-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2009-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2009-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2009-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2010-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2010-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2010-03-09T08:00:00Z","amount":375}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":125,"local_amount":375,"processed_date":"2009-08-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:20:44Z","rounded_local_amount":379.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73641628},{"amount":125,"local_amount":375,"processed_date":"2009-09-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:33:46Z","rounded_local_amount":379.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87081068},{"amount":125,"local_amount":375,"processed_date":"2009-10-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:04:08Z","rounded_local_amount":379.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96997218},{"amount":125,"local_amount":375,"processed_date":"2009-11-09T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:53:53Z","rounded_local_amount":379.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103842562},{"amount":500,"local_amount":1500,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T15:24:54Z","rounded_local_amount":1517.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734138}],"funded_date":"2009-07-24T15:41:24Z","paid_date":"2010-01-15T15:24:54Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ginny Kalish"}},{"id":128625,"name":"Kukapakia Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Belekai never went to school and is a widow with six children who are all high school graduates.

She has raised and sold chickens for consumption since 2007.  She buys lots of 100 one-day-old hatchlings from a distributor in the city of lima and she raises them until they are 45 days old.  At that point, she distributes them among establishments that sell chicken meat in the city's market and in a few stores near her home.  The demand for her chickens has grown because she feeds them nutritionally balanced feed in very good conditions.  Libbne is thinking of buying a new lot of 150 chicks in order to enlarge her business but she lacks sufficient funds to do so.  For this reason, she is asking Edpyme Alternativa for a 1000 new sol loan.

He lives with his wife who supports him in everything. For five years, he has been dedicated to agriculture, cultivating yucca and citrus fruits in the four hectares of land that he owns. However, while he awaits harvest season, he raises hens which he feeds adequately so that when he sells them they are the right weight and are valued at a good price.\r\n\r\nFor these activities, he counts on the support of his children and his wife who take advantage of spaces of land on his farm to sow some bread products for their daily consumption.\r\n\r\nWhat Fredy likes about his job is keeping active and teaching his family what he's learning about farming. At the same time, it is very profitable because he has a consistent buyer for his yucca and citrus produce and respect for his hens. His earnings are good when he sells them.\r\n\r\nThis is his second loan with MFP and what he likes about his community bank is that all the people are trustworthy and, above all, very responsible with their payments. With the money he is requesting, he will buy more yucca plants to continue planting (with 200 soles) and with the rest, he will buy fertilizer to strengthen his land so that his crops grow strong and healthy.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Kate Divjak, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":447723,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Purchase yucca plants and fertilizer.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-12-13T21:30:17Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"lender_count":1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Fredy","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-11-13T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-12T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":350}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":350,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2010-07-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:36:31Z","rounded_local_amount":1004.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159672724}],"funded_date":"2009-12-13T21:50:00Z","paid_date":"2010-08-15T11:36:31Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":165768,"name":"Santa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Santa L. is currently in the business of selling beans and peas in the market and is requesting a loan to purchase bags of rice and corn meal to sell.

","en":"Mrs. Consuelo V. V., 47, is married and has three children.  She has worked making typical sweets for 12 years with her husband and children that help her make cocadas (coconut bars), higos (candied figs), camotes (candied sweet potatoes) and other varieties.\r\n\r\nConsuelo used to not make much, just enough to stock her stand in Antigua\u2019s market.  Because of lack of capital she was only able to make the bare minimum variety.  Because many people sought her out, however, she decided to solicit a loan from a Communal Bank although it was difficult for her because she wasn\u2019t used to having debts.  However, facing the need to help her business grow she asked for 5000 quetzals and, thanks to God, earned good profits and became better known still for her delicious, fresh sweets.  She currently supplies sweets to Antigua\u2019s best known hotels.\r\n\r\nNow that her doors are open she wants to invest more so that the business will grow.  Her dream is to buy a large locale where she can work because she is currently working at home and this had caused problems in that the sweets she makes attract a lot of bees and this annoys her neighbors.  She also wants her children to get ahead and attend the university so that they can become professionals and have good jobs later on.  For these reasons she has called upon Fape to request a loan so that she can reach her goals.\r\n"}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":610748,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To make typical sweets.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GT","country":"Guatemala","town":"Jocotenango Sacatepequez","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15.5 -90.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":97,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1175,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Consuelo ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-09-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GTQ","disbursal_amount":9500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":1175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-27T07:00:00Z","amount":527.74},{"due_date":"2010-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":527.78},{"due_date":"2010-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":527.78},{"due_date":"2011-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":527.78},{"due_date":"2011-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":527.78},{"due_date":"2011-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":527.78},{"due_date":"2011-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":527.78},{"due_date":"2011-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":527.78},{"due_date":"2011-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":527.78},{"due_date":"2011-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":527.78},{"due_date":"2011-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":527.78},{"due_date":"2011-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":527.78},{"due_date":"2011-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":527.78},{"due_date":"2011-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":527.78},{"due_date":"2011-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":527.78},{"due_date":"2012-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":527.78},{"due_date":"2012-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":527.78},{"due_date":"2012-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":527.78}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65.27},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65.28},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65.28},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65.28},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.28},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.27},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.28},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.28},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.28},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.28},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.27},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.28},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65.28},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65.28},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65.28},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65.27},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.28},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.28}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":240105,"name":"December 8 Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Para la formaci\u00f3n el presente comit\u00e9 inicio la se\u00f1ora Doralicia Ben\u00edtez quien est\u00e1 domiciliadla en el Barrio San Roque de C.D.E.

Amongst her steady clients are three schools, some kindergartens and individual clients. During the year she works alone, but in January and February she hires another person to help her because she receives many orders from schools at this time of year. \r\n\r\nWith this loan she will purchase an industrial sewing machine. This is what she needs right now, even though she has four other sewing machines, which she uses for other work. Her goal is to continue expanding her business and increase both her workshop space and her client base.\r\n\r\nAdriana is very grateful for the help from Fondo Esperanza, both for the loans they provide her and for the workshops, which they run regarding business administration. The workshop that has helped her the most up until now was the workshop that taught her how to record her expenditures and income in an accounts book, which has helped her to better organize both her time and her money.\r\n\r\nVi\u00f1a del Mar is both a city and a commune located in the region of Valpara\u00edso on the central coast of Chile. It is known as the Garden City because of its beautiful places and courtyards and is considered to be the tourist capital of Chile. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":875,"image":{"id":639030,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"Industrial sewing machine","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CL","country":"Chile","town":"Vi\u00f1a del Mar","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-30 -71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":157,"posted_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:15Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":875,"lender_count":27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Adriana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-11-15T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"CLP","disbursal_amount":413612,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":875,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":31718},{"due_date":"2010-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":32516},{"due_date":"2010-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":32939},{"due_date":"2011-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":33368},{"due_date":"2011-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":33802},{"due_date":"2011-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":34243},{"due_date":"2011-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":34688},{"due_date":"2011-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":35140},{"due_date":"2011-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":35598},{"due_date":"2011-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":36061},{"due_date":"2011-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":36531},{"due_date":"2011-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":37008}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":67.1},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.79},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":69.68},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.59},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71.51},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.44},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.38},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.34},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.31},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.29},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.28},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.29}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":205.57,"local_amount":97173,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T13:04:52Z","rounded_local_amount":98776.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188679453},{"amount":142.1,"local_amount":67170,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T03:22:13Z","rounded_local_amount":68278.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191420887},{"amount":145.82,"local_amount":68931,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T08:38:30Z","rounded_local_amount":70068.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195839713},{"amount":149.65,"local_amount":70738,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T10:59:45Z","rounded_local_amount":71905.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201282207},{"amount":153.57,"local_amount":72592,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T10:56:27Z","rounded_local_amount":73789.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206150217},{"amount":78.29,"local_amount":37008,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:11:10Z","rounded_local_amount":37618.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211223311}],"funded_date":"2010-12-02T02:29:48Z","paid_date":"2011-06-15T11:11:10Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Suzanne Grasso","image":357930}},{"id":252400,"name":"Jeffren Antonio","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El joven Jeffren Antonio tiene 25 a\u00f1os, es casado El se dedica a la venta y reparaci\u00f3n de celulares.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists, and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture, and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, contains epic mountain passes, and is a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n\r\nTajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

San Rafael is a rural community where most people raise livestock for milk and meat.  It has a warm climate and is very popular with tourists who come to see the Arenal volcano, the clear blue rivers, hot springs, lakes, mountains and the natural beauty of the region.  Pineapple, cassava, oranges and beans are some of the crops grown in the surrounding agricultural areas.\r\n\r\nSilvia is married to Carlos Garc\u00eda and they have a two-month-old daughter named Jimena.  Silvia and Carlos work together on a 12-hectare farm which they rent; this is also where their home is.  They have been raising livestock on this farm for two years.  Her family has a long tradition of raising livestock as both her father and grandfather were in the livestock business.  Silvia is also working hard to finish her university degree which she pays for with the revenues from farming.\r\n\r\nBecause she wants to increase her income to improve her quality of life and be able to continue studying, Silvia needs a microloan of USD $1,000.

She plans to sell the cattle at one of the many local auctions.\r\n\r\nSilvia is part of the Florencia community bank, one of the more than 100 member organisations of EDESA in Costa Rica.

Maria Luz has been engaged in her business for over 5 years and earns approximately 4000 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Maria Luz joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Maria Luz has successfully repaid a previous loan of 3000 PHP from GDMPC. She used her previous loan to purchase new equipment and tools to expand her business. Maria Luz is requesting a new loan of 5000 PHP to buy more firewood to sell. This will be Maria Luz's second loan from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to save as a reserve for future emergencies. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.

Vista Alegre, Ilog, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating three business ventures:  carpentry, buying and selling charcoal and selling chicken. She has three children who are 2 to 7 years old. Maricel joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2007 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past six loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Maricel has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 15,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 9,000, improving the family's standard of living. This time, for her seventh loan, she is borrowing PHP 19,000, which she intends to use to purchase more materials for her carpentry business so that she can continue to save up for her children's education. Maricel C. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work. Help NWTF continue its mission to help the poorest in the Philippines by joining the NWTF Kiva lending team at Kiva.org.

They have 2 children: Jesus, 8, and a beautiful baby daughter, only recently born.  They live in a house they own in the town of Sanchirio (in a forested region of central Peru).  Rodrigo has operated a farming business for 6 years.  He grows coffee, maize and yucca.  After much work, he sells his coffee crop to a local cooperative that stores the coffee and exports it all over the world.  They just started exporting coffee to France and they hope to expand their sales to other countries in the near future.  He takes his other crops--maize and yucca--to the market in the city of La Merced, a trip he makes every 15 days.  In the future, Rodrigo would like to buy more land to grow more coffee.

She opened a breakfast restaurant, while still selling fruit.  Her business has grown since.  She is now able to buy other furniture in the house and provide her children with a good education.  This time Mrs. H. would like to borrow 19,000,000 VND (approximately 1150 USD) to buy more fruit and food, in order to provide better service to her customers.\r\nOn average, her family income is 6,000,000 VND (i.e., 375 USD) per month.\r\n\r\n<p><b>Translated from Vietnamese by Phuong Nguyen, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nCh\u1ecb Tr\u1ea7n Th\u1ecb H\u01b0ng n\u0103m nay 36 tu\u1ed5i,  gia \u0111\u00ecnh ch\u1ecb hi\u1ec7n c\u00f3 3 con \u0111ang tu\u1ed5i \u0111i h\u1ecdc.
