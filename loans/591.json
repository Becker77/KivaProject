He has his own motorboat and works with their children. Teresa runs a convenience store selling ice cream sandwiches and other items. Her aspirations are to grow her business and invest in more products, and in this way she can strengthen her inventory since she currently doesn't have enough selection to satisfy demand. Of course, through the loan she expects to keep making improvements. Her business is located in Salinas Grandes, where she lives, and she's been doing it for 15 years. The idea came to her after they opened up a new storefront where she lived and there were no businesses, so she thought of setting up the convenience store until she made it a reality. Along with offering household products like rice, sugar, oil, milk and other items, she also sells ice cream sandwiches and fish brought in by her husband. The loan will be used to improve her inventory to satisfy her customers demands.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Marty Greenstein, Kiva

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n<P>\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

collective farm as a common worker. He is 57 years old, he is married. Even by the middle eastern standards he is considered a father of many children - he has six. His older children have already grown up and are helping their mother and father. Beside his job at the farm Olimchon also feeds cattle. Right now he has several heads of cattle and sheep. His wife and older daughters are taking care of the cattle (his older daughter is on the photo). Additionally, Olimchon plans to buy one more calf and fodder.

Rosa\u2019s cheese stand is located in the Santa B\u00e1rbara Market (an important market in the city of Juliaca). She is a very charismatic and candid saleswoman who always waits on her customers with a smile on her lips.  What she likes most about her business is conversing with her neighbors in the market.  She has been involved in this activity for three years and considers the most difficult part of her job obtaining the tastiest cheeses since she has a well-earned reputation and people know her cheeses are highly sought-after.  In the near future, she hopes to have a very large shop in which she can sell many more products and, thus, improve her income so that she can give her parents a peaceful old age.\r\n<p>\r\nThis is Rosa\u2019s fourth loan with MFP, and she is committed to making her payments on time, just as she has done with prior loans.

He lives alone in a rented room, and what he wishes for the most is to live out his old age peacefully.\r\n\r\nBecause of his high quality workmanship and reasonable prices, Leoncio\u2019s carpentry business is one of the busiest in the city of Juliaca.  He decided to go into woodworking as a youngster, to make items that people can utilize.  This drove him to learn how to be one of the most well-known carpenters in the city.  What he enjoys most about his work is transforming a piece of raw wood, and he has been in this line of work for 20 years.  He considers one of the most difficult aspects of his business the carrying of heavy large pieces of wood, since he is not as strong as he once was.\r\n\r\nFor the future of his business, he would like to buy new machinery to compete with other larger carpentry workshops.  This is Leoncio\u2019s second loan with MFP, and he is committed to making all his payments on time since he doesn\u2019t want to create any problems for the other members of the cooperative bank where he is well-liked.  With the one thousand Peruvian soles he is requesting, he would like to purchase more wood so he can increase his furniture production.  \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Mary Lynn Malaby, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":410327,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Carpentry","sector":"Construction","themes":null,"use":"To purchase wood.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Juliaca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15.5 -70.133333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-10-21T01:00:13Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Leoncio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-09-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2010-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2010-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2010-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":165}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-10-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:13:24Z","rounded_local_amount":168.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96997696},{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-11-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:55:31Z","rounded_local_amount":168.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103843069},{"amount":175.35,"local_amount":501,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T21:07:21Z","rounded_local_amount":504.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734647},{"amount":57.75,"local_amount":165,"processed_date":"2010-03-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:33:07Z","rounded_local_amount":166.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128992576}],"funded_date":"2009-10-21T08:31:49Z","paid_date":"2010-04-15T09:33:07Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":150058,"name":"Mercedes","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Mercedes es una socia din\u00e1mica y optimista, vive en la ciudad D.

Widowed and blessed with a child, she makes sure that she earns so that her family can have a better life. She has been selling health supplements and vitamins for quite some time now.\r\n\r\nElizabeth has been a regular member of Center for Community Transformation* (CCT) for more than a year. She regularly attends their weekly fellowship meetings and pays her weekly dues consistently. Because of her good repayment performance with her previous loans, she was able to borrow quite a few times in CCT\u2019s Cooperative. She is consistent in paying her dues because she used the money she borrowed to expand and improve her business.     \r\n\r\nTo ensure the success of her business, she would like to apply for a 45,000 Philippine peso loan.

This was after realizing the readily available market in the area for a tea factory, that she developed an interest in growing and selling tea leaves alongside her banana plantation business. This enterprise has seen her earn 200,000 Ugandan shillings on a monthly basis, which has greatly had an impact on her standard of living.\r\n\r\nHer main drawback is the land being infertile with low yields, therefore, with this loan she will buy fertilizer and manure and further expand the tea plantation through buying more seedlings and doing it on a large scale. This will improve her yields, sales, and enable Jovlet to take care of her family's needs.\r\n\t\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1925,"image":{"id":579299,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy fertilizer and seedlings for the tea plantation.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Kihihi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"2 33","type":"point"}},"partner_id":84,"posted_date":"2010-08-05T19:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1925,"lender_count":57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jovlet","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Moses","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ireen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Erasto","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ireen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Adrine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Emmanuel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Annet","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hope","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Norah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Emmanuel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Grace","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mackline","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eliphaz","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Charles","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"James","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Edward","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Zeldah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Abel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Erinah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Medard","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-07-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":4200000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":1925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1050000},{"due_date":"2010-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1050000},{"due_date":"2010-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":1050000},{"due_date":"2010-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":1050000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":481.25},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":481.25},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":481.25},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":481.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":481.25,"local_amount":1050000,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:48:19Z","rounded_local_amount":1061156.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166903706},{"amount":481.25,"local_amount":1050000,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-16T09:15:28Z","rounded_local_amount":1061156.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172297173},{"amount":481.25,"local_amount":1050000,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T15:36:02Z","rounded_local_amount":1061156.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177467448},{"amount":481.25,"local_amount":1050000,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:22:47Z","rounded_local_amount":1061156.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182605538}],"funded_date":"2010-08-06T15:39:10Z","paid_date":"2010-12-15T15:22:47Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Brett & Margaret Silberg","image":null}},{"id":224536,"name":"Mar\u00eda Olinda","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Mar\u00eda Olinda M. de 49 a\u00f1os de edad, reside en el municipio de Ilopango, lugar en el cual vive junto a su grupo familiar el cual esta conformado por: su esposo el cual trabaja para una empresa privada, y junto a sus dos hijos.

She is 48 years old and leads an eight-person loan group affiliated with ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all responsible for paying back the loans of fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nSherlita is married, has three school-aged children and makes a living by raising pigs. She has been in this business for more than 10 years and earns about 9,000 PHP from her work.\r\n\r\nIn 2006, Sherlita joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her life and ability to engage in business. She has successfully repaid nine previous loans from ASKI and is applying for a new one, her ninth, to buy feed and other supplies she needs to run her business. She will use to use the additional revenue made possible by this loan to continue expanding her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 38 branches covering the Central and Northeastern parts of the country. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fishermen and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partners to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva

Jr. is from the town of District 1, Benito Soliven, Isabela. He is 32 years old. Loreto is married and has one school-aged child. To make a living, Loreto owns & operates transportation services. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from operating motorcycle transport services. Loreto has been engaged in his business for over 6 years and earns approximately 4,500 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2011, Loreto joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Loreto is requesting a loan of 4000 PHP which will be used to repair existing vehicle for better service. This will be the 1st loan taken out by Loreto from ASKI. He plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand his business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 38 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

After exercising his profession for twenty years in the Republic of C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, he returned home seven years ago and began a small retail business buying and selling cigarettes, candy, matches, chewing-gum, powdered milk, tea, sugar, soap, and recently selling pre-paid mobile phone cards and telephone cards, and recharging batteries.\r\n\r\nIn his neighbourhood, he is also the local representative of the National Society of Tobacco and Matches of Mali (SONATAM SA). He is quite sought after for the quality and diversity of his products. Over three years ago he decided to join the Soro Yiriwaso MFI to satisfy his ever-increasing number of customers. He is now requesting his fourth personal loan, all preceding loans having been correctly reimbursed.\r\n\r\nWith his new loan he intends to buy 15 cartons of various cigarettes, 5 bags of sugar, 8 packages of candy, 2 cartons of tea, 6 packages of chewing-gum, 7 packages of matches, 2 cartons of soap, 5 additional battery chargers, 40 Orange\/Malitel telephone recharge cards, etc.\r\n\r\nHe

This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.\r\n\r\nOne of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the

B. is from the village of Sto. Ni\u00f1o, Tukuran, Zamboanga del sur. She is 26 years old. Leonisa is married and has 3 infant-aged children. \r\n<p>\r\nTo make a living, Leonisa owns & operates a business venture in the retail sector operating a \"sari-sari\" or general store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from selling daily use products such as shampoo, soap, toothpaste etc. in the local community. Leonisa has been engaged in her business for over 3 years and earns approximately 5000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2008, Leonisa joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Leonisa has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5000 PHP from GDMPC. This previous loan was used to invest in expanding the business. Leonisa is requesting a new loan of 5000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the second loan taken out by Leonisa from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her  family. \r\n<p>\r\n<p>\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n<p>\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three unit offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n<p>\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":125,"image":{"id":388418,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to purchase additional products to sell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Sto.

Nancy has been engaged in this business for over seven years and earns approximately 18,000 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2001, Nancy joined NWTF to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Nancy has successfully repaid a previous loan of 18,000 PHP from NWTF. Nancy is now requesting a new loan of 15,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell.  The loan will be her 17th loan from NWTF. Nancy plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay tuition fees for her two children still in school.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the calling of not just a few but thousands of women.

Mercedes is the group's president.  She is a very hard-working woman.  For a long time she has looked after her household alone.  When she separated she had to find a way of making a living since she had 3 children to support.  They were her inspiration to get ahead.  She remembers that when she used to work as a nurse people were always offering her different products and many people bought them.  So, conquering her fear, Mercedes began to do the same with her friends and family members who began to buy from her.  She started selling different products according to the season.  During the back-to-school season she would offer uniforms, shoes, tights, etc.  Now the Christmas season is here her loan will be used to buy toys.\r\n\r\nMercedes has a lot of orders from her customers and, thanks to her work, she can cover her family's main expenses.

Jinna Lou is requesting a new loan of 4000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional fish like salmon and mackerel. This loan will be the 1st loan taken out by Jinna Lou from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand the borrower's business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

With the help of her past 17 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Emelie has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 50,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 30,000, uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time for her 18th loan, she is borrowing PHP 50,000 to use as additional funds for her business operations so that she can continue to save up for the future and to hire other people for her business and provide income for them. Emelie is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

Represented by their leader Moustapha M., the group describes their business plan as follows: <p>\r\n\r\n\u201cElinkine is a fishing village located 15 km from the departmental capital and 55 km from Ziguinchor [the capital of the southern Casamance region of Senegal].  Its geographic position makes it an incontrovertible hub because it is the only village that serves as a link between the mainland and the islands.  Furthermore, Elinkine is one of the villages with the greatest number of fishermen in the entire country.  <p>\r\nIn order to take advantage of this niche, which has up until now been neglected simply because the majority of people in the fish market dedicate themselves exclusively to the production and sale of dried fish, the Cougu\u00e9lil group has taken the initiative to invest in this business.  We plan to provision the market with fresh fish from our fishing village of Elinkine which is 15 km from the departmental capital and 55 km from Ziguinchor.  <p>\r\nOur group hopes to have a loan which would allow it to purchase fish from the fishermen, purchase ice, and rent a car to transport the product to distant places.  The enterprise will consist of marketing fresh fish, buying it from the fishermen and going to resell it in the city markets and all over the country.\u201d <p>\r\n\r\nOriginal French: <p>\r\n\r\n\u00ab Contexte du Projet: Elinkine est un  village de p\u00eacheur distant de 15 Km de la capitale d\u00e9partementale et de 55Km de Ziguinchor.\r\nSa position g\u00e9ographique lui conf\u00e8re de carrefour incontournable du fait qu\u2019il est le seul village qui sert de relais entre la terre ferme et les \u00eeles.\r\nIl s y ajoute que Elinkine est l\u2019un des village qui compte le plus grand nombre de p\u00eacheurs dans l\u2019ensemble du pays.\r\nPour exploit\u00e9 ce cr\u00e9neau, qui est jusque l\u00e0 laiss\u00e9 en rade simplement parce que la plus part des exploitants des produits de la p\u00eache se donnent \u00e0 la transformation et \u00e0 la vente de poisson sec, le groupement Cougu\u00e9lil \u00e0 prix l\u2019initiative de s\u2019investir dans cette activit\u00e9. <p>\r\n\r\nObjectifs du Pr\u00eat : Le groupement Cougu\u00e9lil \u00e0 pour objectif : de pouvoir ravitailler le march\u00e9 en poisson frais a partir de Elinkine village de p\u00eacheur distant de 15 Km de la capitale d\u00e9partementale et de 55Km de Ziguinchor.\r\nLe groupement souhaite avoir un pr\u00e9financement lui permettant de pouvoir achet\u00e9 le poisson aupr\u00e8s des p\u00eacheurs, achet\u00e9 de la glace et louer une voiture pour achemin\u00e9 le produit vers d\u2019autres horizon. <p>\r\n\r\n Activit\u00e9s : L\u2019activit\u00e9 consiste \u00e0 commercialiser le poisson frais c\\'est-\u00e0-dire l\u2019achet\u00e9 aupr\u00e8s des p\u00eacheurs et aller le revendre dans les march\u00e9s de la place et partout dans le pays. \u00bb <p>\r\n\r\nBackground <p>\r\nSenegal is one of the world\u2019s poorest countries, yet its solid democratic tradition and highly developed associational life distinguish it from other countries in its income group. Especially remarkable are Senegal\u2019s networks of rotating savings and credit associations, which provide the rural poor throughout the country with small loans to finance modest income-generating activities. Repayment rates within these groups are excellent, because they are based on local reputation and personal trust between the members. However, their financial resources are limited to the contributions of their members, frequently subsistence farmers with very little disposable income. This has prevented the traditional associations from meeting the demand for rural microenterprise loans and restricted their impact on the economic development of their communities. Senegal Ecovillage Microfinance (SEM) works with our partner organization CRESP to bridge this gap by linking traditional village credit associations with outside sources of finance.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1375,"image":{"id":6872,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish

That is why I Gede Suendra requested a loan from Dinari Foundation.

Oleh sebab itu I Gede Suendra mengajukan pinjaman kepada Yayasan Dinari,pinjaman ini dipergunakan untuk membeli bibit unggul,pupuk dan juga obat-obat vestisida dan penggarapannya pun menggunakan tenaga traktor karena I Gede Suendra tidak mempunyai Sapi untuk membajak disawah. Hal ini diharapkan panen yang akan datang  mendapatkan hasil yang bagus,dan keuntungan yang diporolehpun  akan meningkat.

is a group loan to be shared by five entrepreneurs from the Diama association in the village of Oussouye in southern Senegal.

Our purpose is to combat migration from rural areas and create employment for the young members of our group.  Our business activities include the purchase and retail sale of cosmetic products such as lotion, perfume, and other beauty products.  These products will be purchased from wholesalers in Dakar, then sold in Oussouye in order to serve the rest of the county.\u201d <p>\r\n\r\nOriginal French: <p>\r\n\u00ab Contexte du Projet: Le groupement  Diama est un groupement de jeune de  Escale \u00e0 Oussouye  qui travail depuis tr\u00e8s longtemps dans le cadre de d\u00e9veloppement et cr\u00e9ant une centrale d\u2019achat de vente de produits cosm\u00e9tique et divers. <p>\r\nObjectifs du Pr\u00eat : Lutter contre l\u2019exode rural et cr\u00e9er de l\u2019emploi pour les jeunes membres du groupement. <p>\r\nActivit\u00e9s : Achat et vente de produits Cosm\u00e9tique tel que : lait de toilette, parfum, et autres mat\u00e9riel de beaut\u00e9.\r\nCes produits seront achet\u00e9s \u00e0 Dakar chez les commer\u00e7ants grossistes puis vendus \u00e0 Oussouye afin de pouvoir servir le reste du d\u00e9partement. \u00bb <p>\r\n\r\nBackground <p>\r\nSenegal is one of the world\u2019s poorest countries, yet its solid democratic tradition and highly developed associational life distinguish it from other countries in its income group. Especially remarkable are Senegal\u2019s networks of rotating savings and credit associations, which provide the rural poor throughout the country with small loans to finance modest income-generating activities. Repayment rates within these groups are excellent, because they are based on local reputation and personal trust between the members. However, their financial resources are limited to the contributions of their members, frequently subsistence farmers with very little disposable income.

She lives in the Kawangware area in Nairobi. Besides her immediate family, she takes care of her 22-year-old sister-in-law, whose mother died. Because Jacqueline\u2019s husband is the eldest in his family, it is therefore his responsibility to take care of his sister, till she finds a job in order to support herself.\r\n<p>\r\nEver since she can remember, Jacqueline had been interested in becoming a tailor. To accomplish this, she joined a training class at Redeemed Gospel Church at Huruma in Nairobi for classes and practical training, which lasted for two years. After training, she started her business in 1996 with about US $147, which she borrowed from her sister. She has since paid that off. She started by making petticoats, which she sold from house to house for a period of six months. The business picked up very well, and with this income she built a stall of her own in Kayole, where she could carry out her business more effectively. She later expanded her business and started making clothes and curtains. And she started offering training; at the moment she has three trainees. Jacqueline was doing well, but unfortunately, her stall was broken into and two of her sewing machines were stolen. Because of this, she had to rent two machines for four months, at about $7 per machine per month. This eventually became too much of a burden and made her business shrink, and she even lost customers.

She is a 54-year-old widow with a child who helps her on the plantation. Although she and her child try to work hard, they still cannot support themselves well. Thus, Mrs. Tang S. decided to ask for a loan to buy two piglets to start a breeding business and she hopes to improve her living conditions after she sells the pigs. <p>\r\nAll members in this group have end-of-term loans, so they are not required to pay any principal on the loan until the very end of the loan term.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.<P>\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<P>\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

The couple share in supporting their family. Nestor left school at the secondary level, then learned barbering. He has been working at this business for 10 years; the income from it allows him to support his family only with great difficulty.  \r\n\r\nNestor is asking for a loan, for the first time, from ALID\u00e9, so as to acquire certain necessary materials that will allow his barber shop to function better so that he can satisfy his clientele. Later on, Nestor would like to open other barber shops so as to grow his clientele. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Teresa Kramer, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":546557,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Barber Shop","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"purchase of clippers and adjustable chairs","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BJ","country":"Benin","town":"SEME-PODJI","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"6.383333 2.616667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":104,"posted_date":"2010-05-27T18:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":300,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Boya  Nestor","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-04-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":150000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2010-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2010-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2010-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2010-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2010-11-07T07:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2010-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2011-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2011-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2011-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2011-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2011-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":12500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":25,"local_amount":12500,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:08:57Z","rounded_local_amount":13343.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151835725},{"amount":25,"local_amount":12500,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T09:10:15Z","rounded_local_amount":13343.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159576122},{"amount":25,"local_amount":12500,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-30T08:14:33Z","rounded_local_amount":13343.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166954636},{"amount":25,"local_amount":12500,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-30T08:51:59Z","rounded_local_amount":13343.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172056293},{"amount":25,"local_amount":12500,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-03T10:26:43Z","rounded_local_amount":13343.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177347828},{"amount":25,"local_amount":12500,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T11:57:17Z","rounded_local_amount":13343.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182482864},{"amount":25,"local_amount":12500,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T11:57:54Z","rounded_local_amount":13343.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188617679},{"amount":25,"local_amount":12500,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-27T09:14:23Z","rounded_local_amount":13343.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191361076},{"amount":25,"local_amount":12500,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-27T09:14:44Z","rounded_local_amount":13343.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195779776},{"amount":25,"local_amount":12500,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-16T08:08:24Z","rounded_local_amount":13343.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201401582},{"amount":50,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T10:03:49Z","rounded_local_amount":26687.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206089313}],"funded_date":"2010-05-30T17:13:54Z","paid_date":"2011-05-15T10:03:49Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":208198,"name":"Sophea's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This group loan consists of four people who live in Preaek Anhchanh village in Kandal province.

She is married and has one child, aged 3.  In 2000, she established her vegetable farming business.

She thanks you for your support. \r\n\r\nOver 70% of Nepal's economy is agricultural.  Typically, Nepali households grow crops on small plots of terraced land.  Rice (bhat), lentils (daal), and vegetables (thakari) are the staples of the Nepali diet.  With a Kiva loan, BPW's borrowers are able to purchase greater amounts of seed and fertilizer.  With more seeds and fertilizer, a borrower is able to grow cash crops to be sold in the local market.  Such crops allow households to move beyond subsistence and provide much-needed cash income throughout the year.  \r\n\r\nThis loan was administered by Kiva's local partner MFI, Patan Business and Professional Women. Patan BPW became Kiva's first field partner in Nepal in 2007.  Patan BPW operates throughout the Kathmandu Valley, offering microcredit and business training programs to low-income women.  In addition to providing economic opportunity to their clients, Patan BPW seeks to empower Nepali women within the home and community.

There he has a cabinet maker's shop, an activity that he learned while working in a business with these same characteristics. He worked with the previous business for 10 years, and has been independent for five years, having purchased his own tools and machines to start his own micro business, which is how he and his family live now.  His future goal is to have an industrial machine and to work particularly on doors in order to distribute them weekly via vendors.  In his shop he works on many different pieces, including beds, dining room tables, shelves etc.  In Gabriel's shop, his clients order products and give him a percentage of the price of the product so that he can get started on his business.  Currently his capital is not sufficient to be able to grow the business and to respond to the needs of his clientele in the periods of highest sales for his products.  For that reason he approached Fundacion Mario Santo Domingo, a Kiva field partner, in order to buy raw materials and agricultural products with his first Kiva loan.  This is also the first financing that he has done with this organization.  With this investment he will succeed in making new designs and exhibiting them in his shop.

Her shop is located at the busy intersection of two major streets in San Ignacio. This business is her livelihood and has helped her sustain her family. Maria, now 50 years old, is married with two daughters, one of whom helps her in her shop and the other is now married and lives with her husband.<p>Like many women in Paraguay, Maria worked in Argentina for a number of years. The economic situation is good enough in Argentina to allow these women to work and save money, rather than living day to day. It is in this way that Maria was able to save the money to open her store by renting some space. She is also grateful to her husband who helped maintain the family during this time. Today she lives in her own house in a preferred neighborhood in San Ignacio, Paraguay.<p>With the credit she has requested, Maria will repair a small-refrigerated cart, which will be of much use

She saved some money and managed to buy back these shops. Eventually, she sold them to buy an empty building, and made it into a pub. Now she earns twenty five dollars monthly.

It was the site of a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, Western culture and Central Asian traditions. <p>\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after it gained its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <p>\r\n\r\nIMON's History <p>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has 2,255 inhabitants.  San Juan Ahuehu\u00e9yo is at 1,160 meters in altitude.  It has an indigenous population of 262.  The indigenous languages are Nahuatl and Mixteco.  The population is economically active.  The meaning of \u201cAhuehu\u00e9yo\u201d comes from tree and its name in N\u00e1huatl is \u201cAhuehuete\u201d.  That is the name of the group that we will talk about.\r\n\r\nThe four members are Mar\u00eda Concepci\u00f3 Gonz\u00e1lez Garc\u00eda, Marina de Jes\u00fas S. S., Gina Rebeca L. G., and Emilia Hern\u00e1ndez Carre\u00f1o.  The last one is who we will discuss.\r\n\r\nEmilia Hern\u00e1ndez Carre\u00f1o\u2019s name does not have any significance.  She is 33, and she went to school until the third year of high school.  The school\u2019s name is Licendiado Benito Juarez, and it is in the same area.\r\n\r\nThe loan she is requesting is to buy raw materials like bulk natural soy and bags of wheat by the kilo.  She makes natural products like wheat milanesa, soy chicharron, soy hamburgers, soy meatballs, and others.  She makes them herself without any chemicals.  Everything is natural.\r\n\r\nHer business does not yet have its own name.  She has been making and selling natural products for 15 years.  She learned together with her husband when they were working in a well-known restaurant in the center of Cuautla.  There they learned the job and the product.  Before starting the production of soy food they sold natural yogurt, fruit, and granola.  It did not go very well for them because they did not have the money to continue producing the dairy products.  But, upon learning to make the products like milanesa and sausages, etc. they saw that this was profitable.  They did not invest much, and they got more earnings.\r\n\r\nHer business is in her house, where she makes her product.  It is important to them to not add preservatives; everything they use is natural.\r\n\r\nShe has a great satisfaction from what she does and that her husband helps her in the business.  Her customers are her neighbors, and they are the best promotion she has where she lives.  She also sells her products in the area markets.  She has two very good buyers who buy wholesale.  She has the desire that someone will get to know them so that they can export their products to other states and they get to know the products.\r\n\r\nThe challenge in her business is the rise in prices of the raw material she uses.  This greatly affects her at vacation time because things don\u2019t sell the same then.\r\n\r\nEmilia has been married to Mariano V\u00e1squez Acevedo for 18 years.  They have four children.  The first is Domingo Vazquez H..  He is the oldest sibling, is 17, and he works independently.  The second is Emilio Vazquez H..  He is in the first year of high school with his brother, Mariano Vazquez H..  They are twins, and go to the same high school.  The little one is Gema Vazquez H..  She is 7, and she is in the second grade.\r\n\r\nEmilia describes her area as a place where there is lots of vegetation, fields, and corn, onion, sugar cane, and bean crops.  Upon entering her community we can observe all of this nature.\r\n\r\nHer house is small; there are three rooms.  They need to finish the walls and the floor, but it has a small garden, which is very pretty.  In the future she wants to give her three small children a good education and a better quality of life.  She was doubtful about the loan, and then it was granted.  She did not believe it was true.\r\n\r\nShe wants to use her own words to say the following, \u201cI am very grateful to the Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad A.C. institution because without their help we would not be able to make this small advance in our business.  It is also very good that they support women and single mothers because they are the ones who fight more to improve their quality of life.  They do not have anyone to join in this battle shoulder to shoulder.\u201d\r\n\r\nShe joined the group by the invitation of Marina de Jes\u00fas S. S\u00e1nchez.  She is currently the group\u2019s representative, and she is the one who puts pizzazz in the group.  They are very united.  She is followed by Gina Rebeca L\u00f3pez Gatita.  She sells sweets in her area.  Then there is Mar\u00eda Concepci\u00f3n Gonz\u00e1lez who sells Mexican snacks (sandwiches) in the primary school cooperative, which is close to her community.  Finally, there is Emilia, who we have discussed.  They form the \u201cAhuehuete\u201d Communal Bank.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1175,"image":{"id":460615,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Manufacturing","sector":"Manufacturing","themes":null,"use":"Buy soy and wheat","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"morelos","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2010-01-05T23:30:18Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1175,"lender_count":35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marina De Jesus","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gina Rebeca ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Emilia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Concepcion","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-12-21T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":15000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":1175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":937.5},{"due_date":"2010-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":937.5},{"due_date":"2010-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":937.5},{"due_date":"2010-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":937.5},{"due_date":"2010-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":937.5},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":937.5},{"due_date":"2010-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":937.5},{"due_date":"2010-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":937.5},{"due_date":"2010-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":937.5},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":937.5},{"due_date":"2010-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":937.5},{"due_date":"2010-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":937.5},{"due_date":"2010-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":937.5},{"due_date":"2010-03-29T07:00:00Z","amount":937.5},{"due_date":"2010-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":937.5},{"due_date":"2010-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":937.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":73.44},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":73.44},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":73.43},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":73.44},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":73.44},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.44},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.43},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.44},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.44},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.44},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.43},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.44},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.44},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.44},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.43},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.44}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":440.63,"local_amount":5625,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:38:51Z","rounded_local_amount":5674.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118080366},{"amount":293.75,"local_amount":3750,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:15:23Z","rounded_local_amount":3783.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123916686},{"amount":367.19,"local_amount":4687.5,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:06:14Z","rounded_local_amount":4729.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128952418},{"amount":73.43,"local_amount":937.5,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:58:37Z","rounded_local_amount":945.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136681245}],"funded_date":"2010-01-06T04:20:35Z","paid_date":"2010-05-15T10:58:37Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ginny Kalish"}},{"id":170782,"name":"Tita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Tita A. is from the village of Bucana-Sicayab.

Dentro de unos d\u00edas espera cosechar sus productos y venderlos a buen precio en el mercado y as\u00ed poco a poco reunir dinero para instalar una tienda de abarrotes en su barrio.\n\nEste es el noveno pr\u00e9stamo de Jaime con MFP, sabe que tiene que pagar todas sus cuotas puntualmente si no desea causarle problemas a su banco comunal, en el cual es un socio muy responsable y puntual. Con los dos mil nuevos soles solicitados comprar\u00e1 nuevas semillas de alverja y papa, tambi\u00e9n adquirir\u00e1 abono e insecticidas.","en":"Jaime is 39 years old. He has always worked very hard to get his family ahead. He lives in his own home with his wife Lourdes, 39, and his minor children, who are the reason for all his work. \r\n\r\nPotato, corn and pea crops are what he does for a living. Every morning he works his land so it will be more fertile and productive. While he does this activity, his wife raises cows. They provide milk for the family and to sell. They know that they have to work in everything they can, since their children's educations require a lot of expenses. \r\n\r\nWhat Jaime likes the most about his work is protecting his crops from the pests that can plague them. He has been doing this for 23 years and he considers that the hardest part is transporting the products to market of the city of Tarma, where he sells his crops. Within a few days he hopes to harvest his products and sell them at a good price at market and thus little by little get the money together to open a grocery store in his neighborhood.  \r\n\r\nThis is the ninth loan that Jaime has had with MFP. He knows that he has to make all of his payments on time if he doesn't want to cause his communal bank problems. With the two thousand nuevos soles he is asking for he will buy new pea and potato seed, and he will also acquire fertilizer and insecticides.   <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ellen Donohue, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":503635,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Purchase seed, fertilizer and insecticide","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-03-10T19:30:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":725,"lender_count":26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jaime","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-02-19T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":725}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":725,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:40:01Z","rounded_local_amount":2051.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166886862}],"funded_date":"2010-03-16T07:01:27Z","paid_date":"2010-09-15T10:40:01Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ellen Donohue","image":541577}},{"id":187730,"name":"Kinta","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Kinta Y. est \u00e2g\u00e9e de 44 ans, elle est mari\u00e9e et m\u00e8re de 6ans.

is a married woman who lives in Binalbagan, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating three business ventures: a general store, a sugarcane plantation, and a rice field. \r\n\r\nHer husband Ramelo, who is 40 years old, works as a jeepney driver to earn his living, and also helps in his wife's business activities.  They have three children who are between 3 to 15 years old; two of them are currently going to school. \r\n\r\nSusan joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2000 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 6 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Susan has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. \r\n\r\nHer previous loan of 15,000 Philippine Pesos (PHP) helped her earn a monthly profit of 9,500 PHP, raising the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 7th loan, she is borrowing 23,000 PHP, which she intends to use to buy stock for the store and fertilizer for the rice and sugarcane. She wants to continue to save up for future education costs and family needs. \r\n\r\nSusan is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She earns her living by operating a grocery store, a livestock business and buying and selling gasoline. Her husband Roel, who is 48 years old, works as a driver to earn his living and helps in his wife's business activities.  They have four children who are between 10 and 16 years old. Antonieta joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2010 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past two loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Antonieta has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 10,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 9,800, uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her third loan, she is borrowing PHP 10,000 to buy more stock for the store so that she can continue to save up for future improvement in her business. Antonieta is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

The official name of this borrowing group is \u0110\u00f4ng Th\u00e1i 1 - nh\u00f3m 11 (11).\r\n\r\nHu\u1ec7 is married and has two adult-aged children. To making a living, Hu\u1ec7 owns and operates a business making food items such as beef noodle soup and bun cha, and selling food. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling snacks and other delicacies in the local community.  Hu\u1ec7 has been engaged in this business for over two years and earns approximately 3.000.000 VND a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Hu\u1ec7 joined SEDA to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Hu\u1ec7 has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5.152.000 VND from SEDA. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. She is now requesting a new loan of 7.392.000 VND, which will be used to purchase raw ingredients needed to make food items for sale. The loan will be the second loan taken out by the borrower from SEDA. Hu\u1ec7 plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to save as a reserve for future emergencies.\r\n\r\nAbout the Other Borrowers in the Group:\r\n\r\n1.

Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in Vietnamese while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\r\n\r\n\r\nHu\u1ec7  l\u00e0 53 tu\u1ed5i n\u1eef.

After the harvest, she sells her crop in the Alto Palomar Cooperative. But what generates her daily but less profitable earnings are her banana and avocado crops, which she markets every 15 days in Punte Paucartambo, a marketing annex between the cities of Villa Rica and Oxapampa.
