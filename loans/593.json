(age 24) married in 2002 and has two children (see photo).  She and her family live in a small village across the Mekong River about fifteen kilometers north of Phnom Penh.  She is requesting this, her second loan with Maxima, to buy materials for weaving.  <P>\r\n\r\nSokphun learned to weave when she was a teenager over the course of a year in which she traveled to a nearby island in the Mekong.  It\u2019s not uncommon in this area for young people to apprentice with experienced weavers.  Initially they weave the simplest designs and, as their skills improve, their output is exchanged as fees for instruction. Sokphum has since passed along the craft to a younger sister.<P>\r\n\r\nIn addition to weaving, Sokphun and her husband also farm rice to feed the family.  He also does construction work in the area.  She explained that the loan will help her by allowing her to buy weaving materials for cash rather than by barter with a middleperson.  If she works with a middleperson, she trades two of every three finished pieces just to pay for the weaving thread.  She, in turn, gets the sales price from a single piece.  If she pays cash for the thread, the cost is cheaper.  If she sells for cash, she can increase her profit by as much as 10% or more per piece. Sokphum smilingly expressed confidence that she could easily repay her loan because, with the quality of her weaving, she can sell all she makes."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":93367,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Weaving","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"To purchase thread and other weaving materials","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KH","country":"Cambodia","town":"Khsach Kandal district","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 105","type":"point"}},"partner_id":61,"posted_date":"2007-12-05T16:20:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":300,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sokphun","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-12-19T17:52:36Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":300,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":25}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":25,"local_amount":25,"processed_date":"2008-01-19T10:15:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T01:42:32Z","rounded_local_amount":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118281},{"amount":25,"local_amount":25,"processed_date":"2008-02-19T10:15:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T01:43:19Z","rounded_local_amount":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":138380},{"amount":25,"local_amount":25,"processed_date":"2008-03-19T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T01:44:24Z","rounded_local_amount":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":161386},{"amount":25,"local_amount":25,"processed_date":"2008-04-19T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T01:45:50Z","rounded_local_amount":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":186448},{"amount":25,"local_amount":25,"processed_date":"2008-05-19T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T01:49:48Z","rounded_local_amount":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":214376},{"amount":25,"local_amount":25,"processed_date":"2008-06-19T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T01:54:50Z","rounded_local_amount":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":242476},{"amount":25,"local_amount":25,"processed_date":"2008-07-19T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T01:58:34Z","rounded_local_amount":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":271494},{"amount":25,"local_amount":25,"processed_date":"2008-08-19T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T02:01:46Z","rounded_local_amount":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":300724},{"amount":25,"local_amount":25,"processed_date":"2008-09-19T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-09-20T07:22:07Z","rounded_local_amount":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331432},{"amount":25,"local_amount":25,"processed_date":"2008-10-19T09:00:03Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-20T07:15:14Z","rounded_local_amount":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":365491},{"amount":25,"local_amount":25,"processed_date":"2008-11-19T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-16T09:18:49Z","rounded_local_amount":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5332336},{"amount":25,"local_amount":25,"processed_date":"2008-12-19T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T01:05:12Z","rounded_local_amount":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9953514}],"funded_date":"2007-12-05T17:52:36Z","paid_date":"2009-01-16T01:05:12Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":30501,"name":"Dafrosa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Dafrosa, age 33, is married with a 4-year-old child.

Thanh Hoa City is the provincial capital of Thanh Hoa province, one of the poorest provinces in Vietnam.

She will use the proceeds from her loan to buy clothes for her market stall.  \r\n\r\nShe buys women's clothes in the Vuon Hoa market and sells them in the Dong Thanh market. With this loan, she will be able to buy 10 jackets on which she expects to make a 13% profit. She buys jackets for 160,000 VND (~US $9.15) and sells them for 180,000 VND (~US $10.30).  On a good day when the weather is chilly (as it is now), she can sell 5 jackets a day.\r\n\r\nMrs. Luong will use the profits from her loan to pay for her children's school fees and for general household expenditures. \r\n\r\nThe loan will be split equally between 6 borrowers. The other borrowers in the group will use their share of the loan as follows:\r\n\r\n* Mrs. Yen is borrowing 1,626,900 Vietnamese Dong (~ US$93) to buy material that she will use to make and sell women\u2019s clothes.\r\n* Mrs. Chien will buy many kinds of small fish to sell in the Dong Thanh market.\r\n* Mrs. Bien will buy outfits to rent to others for special occasions (Teacher Day, Army Day, etc.)\r\n* Mrs. Nguyet will buy pork to make lean pork paste and grilled chopped meat to sell in the Dong Thanh market.\r\n* Mrs. Minh Quyet will buy bowls and dishes to sell in the Dong Thanh market."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":255569,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"To buy clothes to sell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"VN","country":"Vietnam","town":"Thanh Ho\u00e1","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"16.166667 107.833333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":121,"posted_date":"2009-01-16T05:20:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":575,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"L\u01b0\u01a1ng","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Y\u1ebfn","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Chi\u1ebfn","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bi\u1ec3n","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nguy\u1ec7t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Minh Quy\u1ebft","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-10T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"VND","disbursal_amount":9761400,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":1626900},{"due_date":"2009-03-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1626900},{"due_date":"2009-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1626900},{"due_date":"2009-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1626900},{"due_date":"2009-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1626900},{"due_date":"2009-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1626900}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":95.83},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":95.83},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.83},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.83},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.83},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.85}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":95.83,"local_amount":1626900,"processed_date":"2009-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T08:28:56Z","rounded_local_amount":1683600,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20398717},{"amount":95.83,"local_amount":1626900,"processed_date":"2009-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T18:20:26Z","rounded_local_amount":1683600,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27090644},{"amount":95.83,"local_amount":1626900,"processed_date":"2009-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T16:14:03Z","rounded_local_amount":1683600,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35984011},{"amount":95.83,"local_amount":1626900,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T22:56:50Z","rounded_local_amount":1683600,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44444664},{"amount":95.83,"local_amount":1626900,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T20:28:00Z","rounded_local_amount":1683600,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52955276},{"amount":95.85,"local_amount":1626900,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T13:39:49Z","rounded_local_amount":1683600,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63172627}],"funded_date":"2009-01-16T09:31:46Z","paid_date":"2009-08-15T13:39:49Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"June Blender","image":123338}},{"id":87868,"name":"Aditcha","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Dame A.

To make a living, Felicidad owns and operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising livestock.

Felicidad is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP, which she will use to purchase livestock feed and other supplies. This will be Felicidad's first loan from ASKI.

Los a\u00f1os le han ense\u00f1ado a Artemio que tiene que trabajar muy duro si quiere que sus cultivos sean los mejores de su poblado.

He is a man who has always struggled to get ahead in life. He lives alone in his own house, and what he desires the most is to have a peaceful retirement. Through the years, Artemio has learnt that he needs to work very hard if he wants his crops to be the best of his village; and so, with great effort he has succeeded in becoming a leader in the production of potatoes, peas, spinach and carrots. Every one of his crops is highly requested in the markets of the town of Tarma, which is where he gets the best incomes. He has been engaged in this activity for 45 years. What he likes the most about his job is harvesting his products, and he thinks the most difficult part is keeping his lands free form the weeds that constantly grow in his crops. He also says that in his free time he works as a farmhand in other farm lands, as well as by transporting products from the countryside to the city using donkeys, which is known as \"aseminas\". He is now getting ready to harvest his next \u201cAndina\u201d potato crop, which will be ripen by next week. He is a member of the Banco Comunal \u201cVigen Mar\u00eda\u201d (Virgin Mary Communal Bank), this is the ninth loan he has requested to MFP, and he hopes for its cooperation to keep on working towards his goals. On the other hand, he once more commits to complying with the repayments of his dues, as he has done with the previous loans he has requested. On top of this, he likes being a part of his communal bank because all of its members are very responsible and caring people.\r\nUpon receiving the loan, Artemio will invest the money he has requested to buy a bag of pea seeds and 25 kilos of spinach seeds, and he will use them to start his next crop.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":806496,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy a bag of pea seeds and 25 kilos of spinach seeds.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-07-12T08:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Artemio ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-06-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":375}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":375,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T10:30:16Z","rounded_local_amount":1029.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276712705}],"funded_date":"2011-07-14T13:03:10Z","paid_date":"2012-05-15T10:30:16Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Emanuela Villa","image":625792}},{"id":318170,"name":"Asha","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Asha, 36, is the married mother of two children.

Life in rural areas of the Dominican Republic can be rough, with no potable running water, frequent power outages (if one has power to begin with), and inadequate access to healthcare. Despite these difficulties, Sujeiri runs a successful business running a small eatery. With this loan, Sujeiri plans to purchase more food including rice, beans, and sugar.\r\n \r\nThis is Sujeiri\u2019s sixth loan with Esperanza International, and she hopes to continue taking out loans to grow her business and improve life for her family. With her profits, Sujeiri hopes to purchase equipment so that she can also start baking cakes. She will also use her profits to purchase school supplies for her daughter, including a backpack, notebooks, and pencils. Sujeiri is currently studying as well, and her loans have provided her business with the profits that will get her through school. In the future, Sujeiri hopes to build a house of her own that she can pass along to her family.\r\n\r\nEsperanza International seeks to free children and their families through initiatives that generate income, education and health, restoring self-worth and dignity to those who have lost hope.

He realizes that the loan he will receive will be very beneficial for his work. \r\n\r\nBesides being a member of his communal group, he enjoys keeping order at the meetings.\r\n\r\nHe will use the 3000 new soles requested to buy manure and insecticide to care for his crops so that they will be more productive.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":519904,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy manure and insecticides for his potato and gladioli crops.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-04-05T23:00:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1050,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Aurelio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":1050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":3000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1050}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":1050,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:00:17Z","rounded_local_amount":3009.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182588010}],"funded_date":"2010-04-06T18:00:16Z","paid_date":"2010-12-15T15:00:17Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":195256,"name":"Bayarjargal","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Bayrjargal is a widow with two children.

He is separated from Marcelia, with whom he had 5 children, but as a good father, his life revolves around caring for them and offering them a better quality of life since they are all still minors.  He lives in his own house located in the native community of Pumpuriana (central Peruvian jungle).  From the time he was very young he worked in agriculture and when he started his family, more than 22 years ago, he began to farm his own fields.  He started with plantains and coffee, foremost products of the Peruvian jungle.  But with his years of experience and dedication, he learned to grow \u201cachiote\u201d (annnato) which is a more difficult crop and very few people work with it.  That makes Elvin one of  the few producers in his area.  His sales are profitable and thus he gets a good income \u201cthe same buyers personally come to purchase his products\u201d he says.  Besides, he has more than one crop per year and this generates more income.  In the future he wants to buy his own land since what he works on now are communal fields. With this he plans to consolidate his production and be able to pay university studies of his children.  \r\n\r\nHe knows that the opportunity offered him by the association will help him get ahead, because without them he knows can\u2019t achieve more.  This will work out very happily for him.  He belongs to the Hormiguitas de Pumpuriani communal bank and this is his sixth loan with MFP, where he is happy to know that he will have the financial support that he needs.  He promises again to make all his payments on time as he did with previous loans.  He appreciates being part of the communal bank because all of the members are responsible and united.  Elvin will use the requested money  to buy bags of organic fertilizer (natural fertilizer) and he will hire some field hands to help him fertilize and clean out the weeds in his crops.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":806518,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy sakcs of organic fertilizer and to hire field hands","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-07-10T22:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":300,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elvin ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-06-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":800,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":800}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":300}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":300,"local_amount":800,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:42:48Z","rounded_local_amount":823.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244621412}],"funded_date":"2011-07-11T03:02:42Z","paid_date":"2011-12-15T10:42:48Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Miriam Palacio","image":693116}},{"id":318186,"name":"Rebecca","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rebecca, 66, has practiced farming in Ndunyu Njeru town for the last six years.

Especially remarkable are Senegal\u2019s networks of rotating savings and credit associations, which provide the rural poor throughout the country with small loans to finance modest income-generating activities. Repayment rates within these groups are excellent, because they are based on local reputation and personal trust between the members. However, their financial resources are limited to the contributions of their members, frequently subsistence farmers with very little disposable income.

She decided to start fattening pigs, a business chosen by other women in her neighborhood, so she could also learn from their experiences.

Ibu yang memiliki 3 (tiga) orang anak ini selalu belajar untuk menerima setiap hal yang dialaminya sebagai pelajarang yang berharga dalam hidupnya. Hal inilah yang membuatnya mampu membesarkan anak-anaknya dan memberikan mereka didikan yang baik sehingga mereka bisa bertumbuh menjadi anak yang patuh dan ulet. Saat ini tanggung jawabnya dalam memberikan pendidikan secara formal masih kepada anaknya yang paling kecil yaitu Komang Trisna Putra yang masih duduk di kelas dua Sekolah Menengah Pertama, sedangkan yang lainnya sudah mampu membiayai hidupnya masing-masing karena sudah bekerja walaupun hanya sebagai buruh kasar. \r\nKecintaannya terhadap keluarga membuat hatinya tergerak untuk ikut serta mengupayakan kesejahteraan keluarganya dengan membantu suaminya untuk bisa memenuhi kebutuhan hidup yang semakin hari semakin meningkat.  Jalan yang ditempuhnya adalah dengan memlihara babi penggemukan seperti yang juga digeluti oleh banyak ibu-ibu yang lainnya sehingga Ni Luh Darmi bisa belajar dari setiap keberhasilan mereka. Keuntungan yang diperolehnya memang tidak terlalu besar yaitu sekitar Rp 200.000,- Rp 300.000,- per ekor dari memelihara babi untuk babi guling yang dipelihara hanya dua atau tiga bulan saja, tetapi  itu cukup bermanfaat dalam menutupi segala kekurangan biaya rumah tangganya baik itu keperluan dapur, kesehatan perumahan ataupun hal lainnya. DINARI memberinya bantuan modal usaha dan itu dipakainya untuk menambah jumlah penggemukan yang dipeliharanya dan juga untuk memenuhi kebutuhan pakan ternaknya tersebut."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":123588,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Purchase

The women expressed their gratitude for being taught so many things about managing their family income and viewing the farm as a business.\r\nSome of the members went beyond farming to start producing banana and taro chips.  They even opened a food stall to serve the typical Samoan fare of taro, bananas, and vegetables.  The members are now eagerly awaiting for their initial loan so that their business plans can be put into action."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3350,"image":{"id":134203,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nElena is married and has 5 school-aged children. Elena owns & operates a manufacturing business. The main source of income comes from manufacturing & selling bamboo products like \"amakan\" and sticks for barbecues to local businesses and community members. Elena has been engaged in her business for over 3 years and earns approximately 3,500 PHP a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Elena joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. Elena is requesting a new loan of 5000 PHP which will be used to purchase raw materials to manufacture additional products. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Elena from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

The loan will also help him sign larger contracts, which will generate higher revenues for Juan\u2019s business.\r\n\r\nBeing self-employed and generating income for his family have been Juan\u2019s greatest successes. He has great pride in providing for his wife and two young daughters. Juan enjoys managing his own business and loves the flexibility of his work. \r\n\r\n\r\nAbout U.S. Microfinance and ACCION USA\r\nHave you ever thought about how the cute new caf\u00e9 on your corner or the salon you frequent every month got the financial resources to start their business? Chances are, they drummed up support from their friends and family, dipped into their personal savings, used a high-interest credit card, or all of the above. An estimated ten million small businesses in the U.S. face difficulty obtaining loans from traditional banks, even prior to the current \u201ccredit crisis\u201d. Microfinance institutions, like ACCION USA, support these \u201cunbanked\u201d small businesses by giving them access to fairly-priced capital and business education.\r\n\r\nSmall businesses also help stabilize low- to moderate-income neighborhoods and rebuild the economy through income growth and job creation. Self-employment provides workers with a way to increase their incomes, support their families, and strengthen their communities. As unemployment rises in the U.S., more and more people are turning to self-employment and start-up enterprises as a way to take control of their economic futures and provide employment opportunities in their communities. The need for support of small businesses in the U.S. is great, and it is one that ACCION USA has been striving to meet since 1991."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3225,"image":{"id":578396,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"To

Their ambition is to stock up on grains and to market them.  \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":290118,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"To buy potatoes, millet, and ingredients needed for making local beverage ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"S\u00e9gou","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2009-04-01T07:00:28Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":500,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Dad\u00e9                         ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ami           ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mai                       ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sirantou    ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"S\u00e9tou                                 ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-03-06T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":250000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2009-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2009-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2009-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2009-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2009-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.35}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":41666.67,"processed_date":"2009-04-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:28:14Z","rounded_local_amount":41941.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36033736},{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":41666.67,"processed_date":"2009-05-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:38:52Z","rounded_local_amount":41941.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44621103},{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":41666.67,"processed_date":"2009-06-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:21:31Z","rounded_local_amount":41941.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53020069},{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":41666.67,"processed_date":"2009-07-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T19:19:06Z","rounded_local_amount":41941.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63242814},{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":41666.67,"processed_date":"2009-08-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T22:42:19Z","rounded_local_amount":41941.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73678429},{"amount":83.35,"local_amount":41666.65,"processed_date":"2009-09-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T03:55:06Z","rounded_local_amount":41941.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87112462}],"funded_date":"2009-04-04T21:40:01Z","paid_date":"2009-10-16T03:55:06Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Daniel Kuey","image":669418}},{"id":100204,"name":"Karin","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Karin es socia del Banco Comunal Azucenas.\nKarin es conviviente, tiene 32 a\u00f1os y 2 hijos, Karin tiene una peque\u00f1a tienda en su casa en donde vende golosinas, bebidas, su casa esta ubicado cerca de un terminal de buses, adem\u00e1s Karin trabaja como secretaria en la empresa de transporte.\nKarin necesita un pr\u00e9stamo de 1000 soles dinero que ser\u00e1 invertido en la compra de golosinas, gaseosas.\nLos sue\u00f1os de Karin son techar su casa y surtir con mas productos sus negocios.\n","en":"Karin is a member of the Azucenas Community Bank.

business of agriculture and livestock is a job that requires great sacrifice, demanding great efforts which should be carried out in the field, exposed to the sun for many hours and moving animals over long distances. Aware of this situation, Yarkul has been devoted to the agricultural business for more than 5 years. Yarkul has a humble family composed of his wife and 7 children, for whom he provides food and support for their studies. The reason for his requesting a loan is to invest in his agriculture business through seeds and fertilizers.  \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

However, when business ceased to be prosperous, Justina decided to work in a small restaurant serving drinks and lunch for one of the schools in her neighborhood. Unfortunately this work did not earn her much more than her previous work in sewing. The space being rented for the Cantina was very expensive. For this reason Justina decided to quit the cantina and start a more affordable business in her neighborhood. At that time there was a great demand for a place of this kind, as few other existed. Thus, Justina came to open her copetin, a small shop that sells basic groceries as well as serves some food. Her primary clients are mechanics in the various auto-repair shops near her store. <p>When she began her business, Justina didn\u2019t have the necessary equipment. She only had enough to buy them little by little. With the loan she has obtained from the Foundation, Justina will be able to purchase a freezer and refrigerator.

He lives in his house with his wives and their children in KADIOLO .\r\nHe has been in general commerce for 2 years, selling grains and a variety of items that he makes during the year. Experienced from his years in business, he has a great deal of success.  This is his first collaboration with the Soro Yiriwaso microfinance institution. He declares that this collaboration will be a significant benefit to him because the amount obtained will enable him to adequately satisfy customer demand.  With his loan, he plans to buy two tons of corn.  He gets his supplies in KARAGOUAN  and in the neighboring villages of KADIOLO.  His sales are in cash, often by credit (wholesale and retail) to a clientele composed of men and women. He often sells his grains on order. He foresees making a monthly profit of 80,000 CFA, some of which will be used to increase his working capital and the remainder put into savings because he hopes to build a house to live in the town of KADIOLO.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Connie Archea, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":593789,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"Purchase of grains","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Kadiolo ","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2010-09-29T07:20:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":300,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Amadou","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-08-06T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":150000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2010-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2010-11-05T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2010-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2011-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2011-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":25000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":50,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:40:58Z","rounded_local_amount":25851.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172180854},{"amount":50,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T16:14:59Z","rounded_local_amount":25851.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177476825},{"amount":50,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:40:25Z","rounded_local_amount":25851.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182613537},{"amount":50,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T14:43:21Z","rounded_local_amount":25851.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188751966},{"amount":50,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2011-01-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-17T00:56:47Z","rounded_local_amount":25851.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191606221},{"amount":50,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2011-02-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T12:19:49Z","rounded_local_amount":25851.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195917892}],"funded_date":"2010-09-29T18:14:40Z","paid_date":"2011-03-15T12:19:49Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Connie Archea","image":607010}},{"id":232176,"name":"Laura Alfonsina","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Laura de 49 a\u00f1os, vive en una zona periurbana llamada Fort\u00edn caracterizada por sus caminos de tierra y lomas, tiene una tienda de v\u00edveres en la parte delantera de su casa. \n\nCuando ella era peque\u00f1a su familia tenia una tienda.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to epic mountain passes, a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC, and communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still lives in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Little work is available in the area where she lives, so with the help of her older sister she decided to start a business. Using her savings and aided by her sister, she rented a small place at the bazar, and started buying and selling children's clothing. What money she made became the only source of income for the family. She lives with her mother-in-law.  The children are growing and she needs to be selling at the bazar every day. She has been involved with Microinvest for over a year. She has been an exemplary client during this time.

Mrs. Rosenda C. realized that her husband's income is not sufficient for their daily needs.<P>\r\n\r\nIn her own little way, she decided to make a backyard garden for their own consumption, but then their neighbors wanted to buy their vegetables. This being the case, she decided to expand her area, but unfortunately, she had no money to finance expansion.<P>\r\n\r\nShe heard from a radio advertisement that Paglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative is offering a micro-finance program for marginalized people. She became a regular member April 11, 2000, received a loan amounting to PHP 5,000, and was able to expand her vegetable garden.<P>\r\n\r\nShe is requesting a loan of  PHP 10,000.00 for her  5,000 square meter garden. The loan is intended for purchasing fertilizers & pesticides for her vegetable garden. <P>\r\n\r\nAside from financial assistance given by PMPC, Rosenda learned new technologies for vegetable production & capability-building, including savings mobilization. In the future, she and her husband dream of sending their children to college and of acquiring a parcel of land for their

Sulton is dedicated to agricultural work, which is his only income source to support his family, composed of his wife and 4 children. He has been dedicated to this business for several years and over time he has gained experience in cultivating crops. Today Sulton has come to IMON International with the proposition of obtaining a loan to purchase potato seed and fertilizer for planting. It is necessary to point out that in order to carry out the first planting you need to purchase the supplies and it is for this reason that he is confident that his loan request will be successfully granted and he will achieve his objective of having a good harvest to improve his economic situation. <P>\r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International<P>\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and with its famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.
