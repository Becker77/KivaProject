She is single and manages her own household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for her everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nDwighta operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store that retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, 5-pesos worth of cooking oil or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Aside from this, she also retails mineral water for added income. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 1,000 Philippines pesos (Php) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php 30,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nDwighta hopes to be able to expand soon.

H. is 25 years old, has a secondary school education, is married and has 2 children.  Shodali has been farming for two years just like his father Holmurod H. (another Kiva loan applicant).  He has land where he plants wheat.

She is 46, married, and has five children, ages 28, 24, 20 and 14-year-old twins.  All the children go to school.  Marta finished sixth grade but did not continue because of financial difficulties.  She lives in her own house with her family and supports a sister who lives with her.\r\n\r\nShe left Guija for Ndlavela, on the outskirts of the city of Maputo, with her parents when she was very young.  After her marriage, she decided to start a business to help with household expenses.  For more than 14 years, she has been a traveling salesperson.  She has no employees and earns around 6,000 meticais monthy.  She uses this money for household expenses and saves some in her bank account.\r\n\r\nMarta has never had loans from other banks.  She learned about Hluvuku through her brother-in-law, who is also a customer of this institution. This 12,000 meticais loan is her second.  She will use it to buy construction materials (adhesive cement, bricks and other items) to continue construction on her house.  The earlier loan of 8,000 meticais was used for the same purpose.\r\n\r\nShe promises to pay off this loan on time so she can take out other loans.  In the future, Marta would like to ask for more loans to use for expanding her business and finishing her house.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Danielle Maxson, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":529757,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":null,"use":"Purchase of construction materials (adhesive cement, bricks and other items)","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MZ","country":"Mozambique","town":"Boane, Maputo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-26.041667 32.325278","type":"point"}},"partner_id":23,"posted_date":"2010-04-29T01:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marta Fernando","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MZN","disbursal_amount":12000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":18,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":545.03},{"due_date":"2010-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":567.43},{"due_date":"2010-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":590.75},{"due_date":"2010-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":615.02},{"due_date":"2010-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":640.3},{"due_date":"2010-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":666.61},{"due_date":"2010-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":694.01},{"due_date":"2010-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":722.53},{"due_date":"2010-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":752.22},{"due_date":"2011-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":783.13},{"due_date":"2011-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":815.32},{"due_date":"2011-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":848.82},{"due_date":"2011-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":883.71},{"due_date":"2011-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":920.02},{"due_date":"2011-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":957.83},{"due_date":"2011-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":997.27}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.9},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.55},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.23},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.94},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.67},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.44},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.25},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.07},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.94},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.84},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.78},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.76},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.77},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.84},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.93},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.09}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":31.16,"local_amount":1068.49,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:14:23Z","rounded_local_amount":1085.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136698767},{"amount":1.29,"local_amount":43.97,"processed_date":"2010-05-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:28:00Z","rounded_local_amount":44.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144732451},{"amount":317.55,"local_amount":10887.54,"processed_date":"2010-06-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:54:27Z","rounded_local_amount":11057.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151916269}],"funded_date":"2010-04-29T22:48:37Z","paid_date":"2010-07-15T09:54:27Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":199901,"name":"Batsuuri","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Batsuuri S. is 61 years old and lives with his wife and two daughters in Arhangai province, Mongolia.

Se\u00f1ora Ubalda found it necessary to stay at home, and since she likes to cook, she decided to open her informal restaurant called \u201cLos Arbolitos\u201d (The Little Trees).  This way, she can take care of both businesses, her son and her home.  Se\u00f1ora Ubalda is proud of her business because she runs it herself and is not dependent on anyone.  And she likes to cook.  She employs two women, one of whom makes the tortillas by hand and the other takes care of the customers.  The customers are travelers passing through on the highway.  And since she is located at the edge of the highway, they come in for something to eat.  The challenge that Se\u00f1ora Ubalda faces with the business is the price of corn and beans.  She uses her earnings to pay her workers, to purchase dishes for cooking, and for her own outings.  Se\u00f1ora Ubalda is happy with the loan she will be receiving, and she will use it to purchase tables so that her business looks nicer.  Her dreams are that her son goes to University and studies a career and to have a store front for her informal restaurant.  Moyotepec has a warm climate and fields where they grow corn, onions and canes.  Se\u00f1ora Ubalda wants to say to Kiva and to Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad, \u201cThank you for the loans.

He is the third born in a family of 5, raised by a single mother who struggled to see him through school. After completing high school, he took it upon himself to further his education. As a result, he juggled several jobs to pay for his fees. He managed to earn a postgraduate diploma in Marketing. He runs his business from his house because he does not have a shop yet, but plans to set up a shop once he gets financially stable.\n\nWith a Kiva loan, Timothy intends to buy EcoZoom energy-saving stoves and solar lights at wholesale prices and then sell them at retail prices to his community. This will greatly benefit his business, which has begun to rapidly increase lately after he began selling EcoZoom products. \n\nHe has been running his business for 5 months now. With the flexibility of being an individual entrepreneur, he is able to get time to attend classes, tend to his farm and enjoy time with his young family.\n\nTimothy likes working with EcoZoom because he is assured of quality, reliable and efficient products. It has also created him a full time job where he is his own boss, works at his own pace and sets his own goals.\n\nThe impact of Timothy\u2019s work in his village is very evident. Most school going children can now read from home at night, since they use the solar lights and people spend 60% less on fuel, allowing them to reinvest in their homes.\n\nTimothy has hopes and dreams for the future to be a well-established distributor of EcoZoom energy saving products.\n"}},"status":"deleted","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1729488,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Renewable Energy Products","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To purchase energy saving stoves and solar lights at whole sale price","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Rongo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-4.283333 39.433333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":341,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":4975,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Timothy ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-11-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":445000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":4975,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":17800},{"due_date":"2014-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":17800},{"due_date":"2014-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":17800},{"due_date":"2014-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":17800},{"due_date":"2014-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":17800},{"due_date":"2014-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":17800},{"due_date":"2014-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":17800},{"due_date":"2014-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":17800},{"due_date":"2015-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":17800},{"due_date":"2015-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":17800},{"due_date":"2015-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":17800},{"due_date":"2015-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":17800},{"due_date":"2015-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":17800},{"due_date":"2015-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":17800},{"due_date":"2015-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":17800},{"due_date":"2015-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":17800},{"due_date":"2015-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":17800},{"due_date":"2015-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":17800},{"due_date":"2015-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":17800},{"due_date":"2015-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":17800},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17800},{"due_date":"2015-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":17800},{"due_date":"2015-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":17800},{"due_date":"2015-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":17800},{"due_date":"2015-04-29T07:00:00Z","amount":17800}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":199},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":199},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":199},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":199},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":199},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":199},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":199},{"due_date":"2015-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":199},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":199},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":199},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":199},{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":199},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":199},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":199},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":199},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":199},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":199},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":199},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":199},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":199},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":199},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":199},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":199},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":199},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":199}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":2408,"name":"Lydia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lydia retails charcoal in her area.

":"Sr. Valent\u00edn A. is 37 years old.  His wife, Valentina is 34, and together they have three young children. They live in their own house in Benjam\u00edn Aceval, Paraguay. They were able to buy this house through the sacrifice of Sr. Valent\u00edn and his auto-repair shop. Valentina also contributes to the household income by selling sodas out of their home. \r\nBefore establishing his own business, Valent\u00edn worked in a transportation company where he acquired knowledge and experience as a mechanic. It is this work that led Valent\u00edn to establish his own shop in 2004.

In the morning she tends to her children and in the afternoon she sews children's clothing and underclothes to sell to her clients. \r\n\r\nWith a loan of 1,000 soles Yoni will buy 5 kilos of cotton fabric, 5 dozen polo shirts, 4 dozen blouses, and 5 dozen girls' dresses.\r\n\r\nYoni is thankful for the Manuela Ramos Communal Bank for its constant support, and for the opportunity to start her own business. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Sarah Bishop, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":219264,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Used Clothing","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"Buy cotton fabrics, polo shirts, blouses, and girls' dresses","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Caller\u00eda - Ucayali","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":72,"posted_date":"2008-11-11T08:30:14Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Yoni","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-11-25T17:33:56Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":81.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":81.25,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2008-12-25T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T00:54:56Z","rounded_local_amount":253.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9951649},{"amount":81.25,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-01-25T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T13:48:46Z","rounded_local_amount":253.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":10224689},{"amount":81.25,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-02-25T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-17T07:55:52Z","rounded_local_amount":253.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20417410},{"amount":81.25,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-03-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:17:43Z","rounded_local_amount":253.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27110957}],"funded_date":"2008-11-11T17:33:56Z","paid_date":"2009-04-15T20:17:43Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sarah Bishop","image":107465}},{"id":76160,"name":"Channa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Channa H. lives in Prey Char Krouv village in Kampong Cham Province.

The most difficult part of her job is taking the cattle to the markets, since it is very tiring although she knows that one has to work hard to realize his or her goals.  \r\n\r\nThis is her first loan with MFP and she is capable of making the payments on time, so as to not harm the rest of the member of her communal bank, where she is very admired for the responsibility that she demonstrates.  With the 1000 Soles requested she plans to purchase more grazing food for her cattle to feed them better.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Donald Allen, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":310395,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Purchase of food for her animals","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Puno","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15.833333 -70.033333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-05-01T07:00:34Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Yovana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-04-01T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-08-31T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":165}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-05-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T00:54:02Z","rounded_local_amount":179.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44596173},{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:36:57Z","rounded_local_amount":179.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52990449},{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:44:49Z","rounded_local_amount":179.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52990450},{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-07-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:46:15Z","rounded_local_amount":179.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63211563},{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:29:18Z","rounded_local_amount":179.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73641067},{"amount":57.75,"local_amount":165,"processed_date":"2009-09-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:41:51Z","rounded_local_amount":177,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87080525}],"funded_date":"2009-05-01T17:50:09Z","paid_date":"2009-10-15T23:41:51Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Donald Allen","image":null}},{"id":108928,"name":"Roda","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mambo (greetings) from Tanzania!

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback micro-finance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro-leasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":320396,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To purchase commodities in bulk","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbeya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.9 33.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-05-16T19:20:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":750,"lender_count":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Roda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":1000000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","amount":1000000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":750}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":750,"local_amount":1000000,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-10T13:05:59Z","rounded_local_amount":1006125,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144773306}],"funded_date":"2009-05-18T01:34:23Z","paid_date":"2010-12-10T13:05:59Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Michelle Archer","image":162079}},{"id":113024,"name":"Monica","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Monica O. is the mother of five children and grandmother to ten children.

At the end, the interviewer fluctuates between Kiswahili and Luo, saying \"Asante Sana\" in Kiswahili, meaning \"Thank you,\" and \"Erokamano,\" which in Luo means \"thank you.\" The voices in the background are people coming for a weekly K-MET borrower meeting.

James' loan is for Kshs 40,000 and this is the first loan he has ever taken from an MFI. James owns a tailoring shop, which he started three years ago. From his business, he makes a profit of Kshs 12,000 a month. With this loan of Kshs 40,000 James wants to expand his business by purchasing textiles worth Kshs 10,000, buttons worth Kshs 3000, and a new machine worth Kshs 15,000 and use the rest for transport and other needed materials for his business. \r\n\r\nJames was introduced to KADET LTD by a friend who was already a KADET client. James' customers are residents of Kabarnet town and the surrounding area. James hopes this loan helps his business reach the point where he can employ others as tailors. James' dream is to expand his business and even open another business in a nearby town.

She has 3 children and two are still attending school. She has run a tailoring business from her home since 1984 when she decided to start a home business to support her husband with the family expenses. She works at the request of clients, making different designs of clothes, robes, shirts, pants, etc. in addition to clothing repair. She also does embroidery work. She is requesting a $1000 loan from Kiva partner Ameen s.a.l. to purchase additional textiles and a new sewing machine. She specifically notes that she will be able to deliver her services faster because of the new machine. In the future, she would like to expand her client base and she hopes to open a small tailoring factory.\r\n \r\nNote: Based on the political and social challenges of Lebanon, personally identifiable attributes of this entrepreneur have been altered to protect him or her (i.e., blacking out portions of the entrepreneur in his\/her picture, not indicating his\/her name and location, etc.) Ameen s.a.l. appreciates Kiva lenders' understanding of these challenges and encourages lenders to continue their support for Lebanon's borrowers.\r\n\r\nAbout Ameen:\r\nAmeen s.a.l. has been a major player in the Lebanese Microfinance sector since 1999. Originally, a micro-credit program created by CHF International, Ameen evolved to become Ameen s.a.l. in 2003, a Lebanese services company. In 2007, Ameen s.a.l. registered with the Central Bank of Lebanon to become the first Lebanese financial institution specialized in Microfinance.\r\n\r\nAt Ameen s.a.l. we pledge to provide financial services to the largest number of micro and small entrepreneurs and to the working poor, to help them develop their businesses and improve their incomes.\r\n\r\nAmeen has been able to use its interest-free loans Kiva to offer lower-interest loans with faster disbursement for their micro-loan borrowers. Since its inception, Ameen has provided high-quality financial services to over 41,000 borrowers and disbursed over 81,000 loans totaling $115 million.

While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nNena is married and has 4 school-aged children. To make a living, Nena sells vegetables in the local community. Nena has been engaged in her business for more than 10 years and earns approximately 4500 PHP a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Nena joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Nena has successfully repaid a previous loan from ASKI. Nena is requesting a new loan of 20000 PHP which will be used to purchase vegetables to sell. This loan will be the 6th loan Nena has taken out from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated to improve and expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 38 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fishers and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Elvia inici\u00f3 con su peque\u00f1a pulperia en el 2005 y le dio el nombre de Pulperia Gerson, la cual atiende desde las 7:00 am hasta la tarde-noche. Su mayor ventaja es que no hay mas pulperias en la comunidad y sus vecinos realizan las compras diarias en su negocio, aunque ultimamente sus ventas han bajado ya que cada dia los productos de la canasta basica son mas caros. El prestamo que Do\u00f1a Elvia solicita lo necesita para la compra de arroz, manteca, embutidos, lacteos, refrescos, azucar, frijoles, dulces, pan, churros, entre otros. Con el apoyo del prestamo podra surtir de mas y variados productos y con ello sus clientes siempre encontraron lo que necesitan. Su meta es apoyar a sus hijos con el estudio, aunque siente un poco de temor de que al graduarse no encuentren un empleo, asi que espera que ellos se decidan a tener un negocio propio al igual que ella. Este es el primer ciclo de Do\u00f1a Elvia en FAMA y espera cumplir de manera puntual el pago de sus cuotas.

She is a very caring person and proud of her three children because they are good people and good students.  Elvia started her small store in 2005 and named it Gerson Store which operates from 7AM until dusk.  Her greatest advantage is that there are no other convenience stores in the community and her neighbors carry out their daily shopping at her store.  Ultimately, her sales have dropped due to the daily increasing cost of staple goods.  Elvia solicits a loan to purchase: rice, lard, sausages, milk, soft-drinks, sugar, beans, sweets, bread, and churros amongst other things.  By having support from the loan she can then stock more and varied products which will allow her customers to always find what they need.  Her goal is to help her children with school although she fears they may not be able to find employment upon graduation which is why she hopes they establish a business of their own just like her.  This is Elvia's first loan with FAMA and she expects to make punctual payments."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":848070,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to purchase groceries in general","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"Gualaco, Olancho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15 -86.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":168,"posted_date":"2011-08-19T18:30:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":800,"lender_count":28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elvia Margarita ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-07-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":15000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.66},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.66},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.66},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.66},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":1250,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-17T07:57:54Z","rounded_local_amount":1251.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227307960},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":1250,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T08:51:51Z","rounded_local_amount":1251.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232784942},{"amount":133.33,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:46:37Z","rounded_local_amount":2502.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244547433},{"amount":133.33,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-29T08:38:49Z","rounded_local_amount":2502.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257165367},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":1250,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:18:47Z","rounded_local_amount":1251.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263297138},{"amount":66.66,"local_amount":1250,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-19T08:08:46Z","rounded_local_amount":1251.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":277415733},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":1250,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-16T08:14:14Z","rounded_local_amount":1251.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283476790},{"amount":66.92,"local_amount":1254.71,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T08:54:33Z","rounded_local_amount":1256.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":286850510},{"amount":133.08,"local_amount":2495.29,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-16T08:36:48Z","rounded_local_amount":2497.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294551394}],"funded_date":"2011-08-26T08:39:19Z","paid_date":"2012-08-16T08:36:48Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Gustavo  Gutierrez","image":430326}},{"id":331050,"name":"Emelie","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Emelie is 43 years old and lives in the Philippines.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are deemed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor coverage of basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that is allows clients to use equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":320442,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Tailoring","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"To purchase tailoring materials","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mwanza","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.516667 32.9","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-05-16T20:30:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Vick","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","amount":500000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":375}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":375,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-10T13:05:59Z","rounded_local_amount":500812.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144773312}],"funded_date":"2009-05-16T21:57:00Z","paid_date":"2010-12-10T13:05:59Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Laurie Russell","image":1324922}},{"id":113040,"name":"Salome","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Salome es socia del Banco Comunal Obreras.\nSalome es soltera, tiene 62 a\u00f1os y 3 hijos, Salome tiene una distribuidora de gas, el local esta en su casa, la venta es al por mayor y menor, para lo cual cuenta con empleados que llevan el producto a domicilio, actividad que realiza con la ayuda de sus hijos.\nSalome necesita un pr\u00e9stamo de 2000 soles dinero que ser\u00e1 invertido en la compra de balones.\nLos sue\u00f1os de Salome son incrementar sus ventas y tener otros puntos de venta.\n","en":"Salome is a member of Communal Bank Obreras.

Empanadas (dough stuffed with cheeses and meats and then fried) are a favorite food in the Dominican Republic. \r\n\r\nColasa is the coordinator for the group <i>L.

However, despite all the obstacles, he continues searching and finally finds that opportunity as a result of certain circumstances and conditions.  It is especially important that at this moment, a person would not get scared, but would take this brave step, the step toward a better future.  The leader of the group, Aida I., decided to take this step.  She already had a job and could have calmly continued her modest existence.  However, in 2007, she found a job at a company that sold cosmetics through network marketing.  Aida is thirty years old.  She has a seven-year-old daughter, who currently attends school and goes to first grade.  In order to support herself and her daughter, Aida is involved in cosmetics sales and also works as an assistant to a sanitary physician.  Her salary is two thousand two hundred som ($50).  She has been involved in cosmetics sales for the third year already, and her monthly income increased to two and a half thousand som ($60).  It should be noted that at the cosmetics sales company, Aida is involved in a fairly new way of sales, network marketing.  The specifics of this type of sales include input from the client and a constant search for customers in order to increase income.  And now Aida needs a loan in order to purchase cosmetics for sale.\r\n\r\nJanylbubu T. is forty-six years old.  She is a mother of two sons, both of whom attend school.

She is requesting this loan for the purchase of fabric for sewing.\r\n\r\nKulay A. is forty-six years old.  Her husband works as a welder.  Kulay and her husband raised two children.  In order to help her husband support the family, Kulay wants to find a job at the alcohol manufacturing plant.

From a very young age she learned to make beautiful decorations of foam (a plastic material that is spongy and comes in various colors) for schools and for kids' parties. Having worked as a teacher she has had the advantage of knowing the clients. Her colleagues always make requests for her work, resulting in a good source of income. She takes a great deal of time to make these crafts, designing different animated characters. While it has been very difficult to keep up this business but in the end it all worked out. She has a number of orders that remain unfilled from various school. She is trying to meet her clients' demands. In the future she has a small store from where to display her various products and different designs. This will be her fifth loan with MFP (Kiva Field Partner) and she is very ahppy to have the financial support. She has always shown responsibility with her payments. She also enjoys taking part in the community bank with all the other members because they, too, are responsible members. She is grateful to all those individuals that will lend her money because it will be key in the progress of her business. The loan she requests will be invested in the purchase of materials, such as foam, glue, and fabrics to make her educational displays.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Erika Lindig, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":603619,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To purchase materials such as glue, foam, and fabrics.

She is a hard-working woman who lives in her own home together with her partner, 33 year-old Adolfo, and her two beloved children (11 year-old Andover and 2 year-old Adely) who are the motivation behind all her efforts.\r\n\r\nThe crops that Edith has managed to grow with so much will and devotion have helped her a lot in making progress in life.  Every morning, she starts working on her land since she knows that the care that she provides for her cacao, coffee and barbasco plants will affect the quality of the end crops that she obtains.  What Edith most enjoys about her work is caring for her plants and she feels very happy when she sees them grow big and lush.  She has been in this business for six years and she considers the most difficult part of her work to be transporting her produce to the city of San Francisco which is where she receives the best prices for her beans and barbasco root.  In the future, she hopes to sow more cacao and barbasco plants since she has land that is currently not cultivated.\r\n\r\nThis is Edith's fifth loan from MFP.  She knows that she must make all her repayments on time and she is ready to do so.  Edith is a very supportive and responsible member of her community bank.  She will use the loan she has requested to hire day laborers to support her in looking after her plants, for example by pruning her plants and getting rid of the weeds that grow in her fields."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":778285,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to hire day laborers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-05-27T10:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":750,"lender_count":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Edith","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-05-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":165.53},{"due_date":"2011-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":174.79},{"due_date":"2011-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":179.49},{"due_date":"2011-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":184.86},{"due_date":"2011-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":197.91},{"due_date":"2011-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":202.54},{"due_date":"2011-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":210.85},{"due_date":"2012-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":220.42},{"due_date":"2012-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":228.54},{"due_date":"2012-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":235.07}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.07},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.55},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.31},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.32},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":74.22},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75.95},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.07},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":82.66},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.7},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":88.15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":62.07,"local_amount":165.53,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:33:36Z","rounded_local_amount":170.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216550379},{"amount":65.55,"local_amount":174.79,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T09:12:53Z","rounded_local_amount":180.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221719055},{"amount":67.31,"local_amount":179.49,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-18T08:02:57Z","rounded_local_amount":184.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227350520},{"amount":69.32,"local_amount":184.86,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:48:37Z","rounded_local_amount":190.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232851004},{"amount":74.22,"local_amount":197.91,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:57:04Z","rounded_local_amount":203.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238666164},{"amount":75.95,"local_amount":202.54,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:43:44Z","rounded_local_amount":208.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244621287},{"amount":79.07,"local_amount":210.85,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:50:18Z","rounded_local_amount":217.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250835414},{"amount":82.66,"local_amount":220.42,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:17:49Z","rounded_local_amount":227.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257245226},{"amount":85.7,"local_amount":228.54,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:32:04Z","rounded_local_amount":235.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263385346},{"amount":88.15,"local_amount":235.07,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:28:03Z","rounded_local_amount":242.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270098456}],"funded_date":"2011-05-27T16:59:41Z","paid_date":"2012-04-15T10:28:03Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Oxnard","image":null}},{"id":306474,"name":"Agustina","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Agustina tiene 32 a\u00f1os de edad, ella tiene 2 hijos y vive en el distrito de za\u00f1a a 45 minutos de la ciudad de Chiclayo ella cuenta con casa propia la misma que solo cuenta con los servicios b\u00e1sicos.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.

She is married and has 6 children adult -aged children.  To make a living, Akenese owns & operates a business venture in the food sector making & selling food.  While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling soft drinks in the local community.  Akenese has been engaged in this business for over 4 years and earns approximately $520 WST a month from these activities.\n\nIn 2007, Akenese joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve  her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Akenese has successfully repaid a previous loan of $1250 WST from SPBD.  This previous loan was used to invest in expanding the business.  Akenese is now requesting a new loan of $2000 WST which will be used to purchase a transport vehicle to improve the business.  The loan will be the 3rd loan taken out by the borrower from SPBD.  Akenese plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business  to improve\/expand the borrower's business.\n\nAbout SPBD:\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.\n\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":399776,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

In Mixteco (a local indigenous language), itacuan means yellow flower.  It is well known in these regions as it is a flower that is used to decorate alters in the festivals for the Day of the Dead.  This group has completed several loan cycles, and is made up of 10 women who know themselves to be as well prepared as they have been in the previous loan cycles.  This group includes a committee who organizes them in order to make payments and complete the processes for the repayment of the loan.\r\n\r\nThe representative of this group is Se\u00f1ora Araceli R. L..  She is 34 and is married to Se\u00f1or Fortino C. Martinez.  Together they have 5 children who are studying in secondary or primary school.  Se\u00f1ora Araceli works selling live and butchered chickens.  This is what she is asking for a loan for, in order to buy more chickens and be able to sell them, and the earnings that she obtains are for the economic support of her family and to make her repayments, and by the same manner to be able to grow her business and have more income.\r\n\r\nOne of the members of this group is Se\u00f1ora Matilde C. M..  She is 48 years old and is married to Se\u00f1or Nemesio C. Calderon.  He does farm work.  They have 4 children whom are all married.  She works selling tamales, work that she learned to do thanks to her mother, who taught her how when she was an adolescent.  She began doing this work more than 15 years ago because of what she needed to fund the education of her children.\r\n\r\nSe\u00f1ora Matilde makes different types of tamales like:  sweet, delicious, onion and cheese, chicken mole, pork and green chili, iguana mole, tichinda, fish mole, among others.  She makes these tamales every day, and every day she sells 3 different ones.  This is why she is asking for a loan in order to buy more ingredients to make her tamales, like corn, corn leaves, and different products to be able to make the filling that fills the tamale.  She sells her products on foot in the town, and she always sells out as her tamales are very delicious and she is recognized for this in her town.  Because of this she has many customers.\r\n\r\nHer dream is to be able to have another business that would make more profits.  Although making tamales is exhausting and laborious and provides small earnings, she has to continue making them as it is how she survives economically.  She is very punctual with her repayments and she plans to continue making them as always.  She is grateful to the people who give her help though the loan.\r\n\r\nThe people who make up this group are the following:\r\nHeriberta Rafaela R. R.:  42 years old, she works making cheese for sale.\r\nEmma S. R.:  54 years old, she works purchasing and reselling pigs.\r\nFrancisca S. G.::  40 years old, she works purchasing and reselling pigs.\r\nElizabeth Soledad M. M.:  21 years old, she works selling clothing by catalog.\r\nCarmen C.

(Greetings) from Tanzania! This is 41-years-old Fedelina U. from Mwanza. She is married with six children, between the ages of eleven and nineteen. Fedelina has been running  a small \"duka\" or neighborhood shop in the city where she has been selling common household and grocery items since 1990. She sells soaps, wheat flour, sugar, cooking oil, margarine, etc. She works at the business for twelve hours per day, six days per week, and is assisted by her husband.<P>\r\n\r\nFedelina currently earns about US$162 a month from her business. She is requesting a loan of US$ 400 in order to buy larger quantities to re-sell at higher prices. In the future, she plans to increase her inventory. Fedelina thanks you for your support!<P>\r\n\r\nABOUT SELFINA:<P>\r\n\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. <P>\r\n\r\nCustoms and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.<P>\r\n\r\n One of the primary advantages of micro-leasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":257010,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To buy larger quantities and re-sell at higher prices","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mwanza","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.516667 32.9","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-01-18T19:20:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Fedelina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-30T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-03-31T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-06-29T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-07-29T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-10-27T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-03-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:53:02Z","rounded_local_amount":52500,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130723},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:57:54Z","rounded_local_amount":52500,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130724},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:27:30Z","rounded_local_amount":52500,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027513},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-05-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:16:03Z","rounded_local_amount":52500,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613514},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-06-29T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:03:29Z","rounded_local_amount":52500,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010593},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-07-29T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:40:10Z","rounded_local_amount":52500,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63232879},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-08-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:54:07Z","rounded_local_amount":52500,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73664679},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-09-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T02:47:55Z","rounded_local_amount":52500,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87105410},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-10-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T06:28:37Z","rounded_local_amount":52500,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97022555},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-11-26T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:42:30Z","rounded_local_amount":52500,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103867804}],"funded_date":"2009-01-18T19:58:44Z","paid_date":"2009-12-15T14:42:30Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":88496,"name":"Erlinda","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"<p>Erlinda A. sells a variety of goods in her neighborhood, which helps her sustain her family.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions.

Winter temperatures can average -20 Celsius. Sixty percent of the city population live in tents called gers, with wooden frames covered by layers of wool felt. On average, households located in the Ger Districts use 5 tons of coal and 1.5 tons of wood per year. Sixty percent of the pollution in the city during the heating season is attributed to coal burned in the Ger Districts. The bottom fifth spend as much as 40% of their monthly winter income on heating fuels.\r\n\r\nXacBank has worked with MicroEnergy Credits to launch a line of eco-products consisting of energy efficient stoves and ger blankets, which will reduce energy consumption.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":486086,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Energy","sector":"Personal

Nazar is 50 years old. He was born in Dushanbe, Tajikistan. He is the father of six children and his main work consists of breeding cattle. This very remunerative activity enables him to provide for the needs of his family. A very ambitious man, Nazar would like to buy a greater number of cattle and to build a farmhouse to house them in order to ensure their safety. Due to a lack of finances, he is asking for a loan of 4,500 Somoni for the realization of this project. When his dream is carried out, Nazar will be able to have a greater source of revenue for his growing family. With your help, this will be possible.     \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She has a small grocery store in her house, which is very well stocked.  She has had this business for 4 years; she started out with only a few items, such as snacks, fruit, etc.  Over time she was investing in the business, and this made it grow little by little until it became a well-stocked grocery store.  She requests this loan because she wants to make a substantial investment in her business before the 30th of May, when she hopes that the sale of all items will increase because of Mother's Day.

Her long-term goal is to have a tailoring shop a few years from now so that she can give the opportunity of employment to others. \r\n\r\nMagdalena hopes to maintain a long-term, sustainable business. She is now requesting another ASHI loan through Kiva, this one for the much larger amount of 25,000 PHP, in order to purchase fabric cottons and three high-speed sewing machines, and to maintain her sewing business.  The capital will fund further expansion of the family ventures to support Magdalena\u2019s dream for her children to have a decent way of life.

It is in her house in Moyotepec. She wants to enlarge her workshop and have more space to work and open another curtain. Her customers are people who pass by on the highway in their cars who see the slippers and like them enough to take 3 or 4 pairs. People who live here in Moyotepec pass by and like them as well. Sometimes they order the color of their preference. She offers her customers slippers, stuffed animals, cushions and perfumes. She started her business 5 years ago. She was working in a factory that makes slippers and she learned how. Now she makes them. She buys the fabric. She has two sewing machines, one she bought and one her husband bought. She considers her business to be important because with it she pays the family expenses. She bought her sewing machine to help her children's studies and she feels proud that she has been able to get her children ahead. She doesn't have to borrow for her children's school fees, she uses the money from her business. Her daughter helps her make the slippers. She cuts the pieces and she finishes them. She puts on the eyes, the nose, etc. When she has a lot of work, her husband helps as well. He sews the pieces when it's cold out, which is when they sell more and ramp up production.  Lidia is very happy with the loan which will give her help to enliven her business. She is going to invest more in it and increase production. She hopes to make the improvements for her children, so that they can have their own space. She wants to make more bedrooms, and she also wants to grow her business and give work to someone who can help with the work. She will re-invest the earnings, and she will save for her household expenses.  She likes the community of Moyotepec. It is very calm, has a good climate, and has all services. \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ellen Donohue, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2125,"image":{"id":596684,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To purchase materials for stuffed animals, filling, foam, thread, tovena  and insoles.

She supports her family by buying and selling bananas. She lives in Toboso, Negros Occidental. \r\n\r\nShe has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 1996 and has improved her living conditions with the help of loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her banana-selling business, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 3000. Rosemarie is borrowing PHP 15000 so that she can purchase more stock to sell. This will be her 20th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 14000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Rosemarie aspires to improve her family's living conditions and ensure her relatives' future well-being by following the Dungganon way.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through its program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

He is married and the father of five children, and he resides with his wife and their children in a large traditional extended family in the Bougoula Ville district, the downtown of Sikasso City (3rd administrative region of the Republic of Mali).  He became familiar with woodworking at a young age from his father, who was a well-known master craftsman. He is much in demand by the people of Sikasso. \r\n\r\nWith major experience in his domain, Diakalia receives many orders, but the means he has at his disposal are insufficient to satisfy further all these needs, which are increasing continuously. So he decided to join the micro-finance institution Soro Yiriwaso about three years ago and is now on his third individual loan. This new loan will be used to buy one and a half 10-tonne truck loads of rafters and planks and a half load of plywood.\r\n\r\nHe buys his lumber in surrounding towns (Tinkr\u00e9la, Denderso, Lobougoula, etc.) and then cuts them up and brings them to Sikasso for making furnishings, benches, tables, desks, and chairs for resale.  \r\n\r\nWith this loan, Diakalia envisions making a monthly profit of 300,000 francs CFA that will be used essentially for increasing his business capital for expenses, to help with family expenses, and to cover the loan interest. The rest will be invested in his business. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":740689,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Furniture Making","sector":"Manufacturing","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"to buy lumber","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sikasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.316667 -5.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:32Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1075,"lender_count":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Diakalia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-03-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2011-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2011-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2012-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":125000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":268.75},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":268.75},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":268.75},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":268.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":268.75,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2011-06-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:52:23Z","rounded_local_amount":125346.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216581056},{"amount":268.75,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2011-09-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T10:13:35Z","rounded_local_amount":125346.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232881992},{"amount":268.75,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2011-12-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T11:23:00Z","rounded_local_amount":125346.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250874233},{"amount":268.75,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2012-03-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-11T08:20:26Z","rounded_local_amount":125346.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270139762}],"funded_date":"2011-04-03T07:18:12Z","paid_date":"2012-05-11T08:20:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Daniel Kuey","image":669418}},{"id":290114,"name":"Izolda","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Izolda L. lives in Zestaponi District, in the village of Meore Sviri.

She sells a variety of merchandise for cash and on credit such as women's accessories, cosmetics, perfumes and stationery products.  She is linked to some important companies and sells products on credit from specialized catalogs.  She takes advantage of their best offers so that she can pass on products to her customers at a good price.\r\n\r\nIn the beginning, Vanessa had a small display case where she displayed folders, paper, card, pens and other stationery products.  However, she gradually added other products as she started working with several other catalogs in order to diversify her stock.  As her profits increased, as a result of her willingness to work hard, she managed to buy three display cases and a computer, taking advantage of a captive market niche in order to offer transcription services.  In addition, as she likes baking, she also makes delicious desserts which she sells to her customers who are aware of the delicious treats she makes and order them frequently.\r\n\r\nVanessa's dream is to expand her business and sell a large variety of products so that she can satisfy the needs and interests of her customers.  By having what her customers want, she will increase her sales and thereby her income.  In this way, although she faces challenges from her competition on a daily basis, her good service and timely response to her customers will allow her to control and sustain her business.\r\n\r\nThis is the first loan that Vanessa has applied for from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo and she will use it to buy merchandise from her main catalogs such as plastic products and cosmetics which have very good discounts.  This will be a very timely investment because, during this second semester, her sales usually pick up because of the bonuses that employees receive and spend on things that they want and need.  Usually, without this incentive, they don't manage to buy them."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":789974,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy merchandise from catalogs such as plastic products and cosmetics","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Soledad Atl\u00e0ntico","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2011-06-14T13:50:01Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":750,"lender_count":27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Vanessa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-06-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1300000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":97382},{"due_date":"2011-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":99249},{"due_date":"2011-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":101151},{"due_date":"2011-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":103090},{"due_date":"2011-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":105066},{"due_date":"2011-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":107079},{"due_date":"2012-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":109132},{"due_date":"2012-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":111224},{"due_date":"2012-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":113355},{"due_date":"2012-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":115528},{"due_date":"2012-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":117742},{"due_date":"2012-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":120002}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.18},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.26},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.36},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.47},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.62},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":61.77},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.96},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.17},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.4},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.65},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.93},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.23}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":56.18,"local_amount":97382,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:49:47Z","rounded_local_amount":99722.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221673831},{"amount":57.26,"local_amount":99249,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-17T08:02:01Z","rounded_local_amount":101634.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227320387},{"amount":58.36,"local_amount":101151,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:06:04Z","rounded_local_amount":103582.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232803509},{"amount":59.47,"local_amount":103090,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:18:11Z","rounded_local_amount":105568.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238614593},{"amount":60.62,"local_amount":105066,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:06:50Z","rounded_local_amount":107591.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250779892},{"amount":56.48,"local_amount":97891,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T09:30:14Z","rounded_local_amount":100244.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270038573},{"amount":68.26,"local_amount":118320,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:43:23Z","rounded_local_amount":121164.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276650760},{"amount":64.17,"local_amount":111224,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:09:41Z","rounded_local_amount":113897.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287100327},{"amount":238.66,"local_amount":413684,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:05:10Z","rounded_local_amount":423628.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301395593},{"amount":30.54,"local_amount":52943,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-18T08:27:17Z","rounded_local_amount":54215.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308775498}],"funded_date":"2011-06-19T02:32:23Z","paid_date":"2012-10-18T08:27:17Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Oxnard","image":null}},{"id":310603,"name":"Flavia's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Flavia is 22 years old and lives in the town of Kyengera in the Kampala central region of Uganda.
