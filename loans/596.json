Her main business is agriculture, and she works hard to grow lettuce, peas, spinach, Chinese onions and potatoes, which are in most demand in her town.  Every morning, as she has been doing for five years no matter what the weather conditions were, she goes out to work on her land because she knows her income depends on sales of her produce, which takes an average five months to grow.  She then takes it to the wholesale market in the city of Tarma to be sold.  \r\n\r\nWhat she likes most about her job is working the lands.  The most difficult part is getting her produce to market.  But she does not let this get her down, and she takes her spinach crop to the capital city where she can earn more money.  In the future she would like to buy more land to increase production and buy a truck with her earnings.  Everything is all based on her children's future, as she would like to put them through college.

Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is a businesswoman who makes handicrafts from clay.  Yanira is married and has three children aged 10, 13 and 3.  She started her business when she was 21 years old through a sister-in-law who taught her how to make handicrafts from clay.  She learned to make vases and pots.  Over time she gained more experience and started working independently.  She now works under her own means.  She sells her products in her community and travels to the central market in the city of Le\u00f3n to offer her clay handicrafts.  One of the most popular items she sells are piggy banks in which children save their money.\r\n\r\nYanira requested this loan to buy raw materials such as clay, paints and molds with which to make her handicrafts.  She would also like to invest in covering the costs of exporting her handicrafts to Costa Rica.  With this investment, she will manage to open a route to exporting her products outside of Nicaragua.  One of her hopes for the future is to expand throughout Central America.

Fifteen years ago, she consolidated her business, just as many of the very busy stores in the area have done.  Now she needs a third person to help out with her lubricant business.  She is sure her business will continue to grow.  She just purchased some hard-to-find replacement parts that are necessary for the repair of any kind of vehicle, so that she could supply local mechanics.  Carmen could service any vehicle.  She has all the necessary tools, and now all she needs is an employee and a good location in which to set up shop.  Carmen started her loans with MFP seven years ago, and she thinks that the institution is an opportunity for the development of her business.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is 29 years old and is the mother of 2 children who are 12 and 8 years old. Both children attend school. Fatima studied through 12th grade and then stopped because of a lack of funds, but she plans to pursue more advanced studies. She lives in her own home with her family and she also cares for her mother, who lives with her.\r\n\r\nShe left Maputo for Boane in search of work and better living conditions. She has had her own business for more than 5 years and has one employee who helps her with her work. On top of this, for the past year she has also been working in a company that produces photographic film (Fuji). In this job she earns a monthly salary of  3000.00 Meticales and her business earnings come to around 4000.00 Meticales a month. She uses this income to cover household expenses and she also saves around 500.00 Meticales a month in her bank account. \r\n\r\nFatima has never taken out a loan with another bank. She found out about Hluvuku [the Kiva Field Partner] through people close to her who have worked with the institution for a long time. This is her 2nd loan, for the amount of 15,000.00 Meticales. She plans to use this money to buy products (brooms, rakes, cleaning products and other items) in order to expand and strengthen her business. Her earlier loan was for 150,000.00 Meticales and was used for the same purpose.\r\n\r\nShe promises to repay the loan as indicated in order to be eligible for other loans later.

She is fifty-seven and a widow. She has three sons and they are twenty-three, twenty-eight and thirty-three. Her two elder sons work in Bishkek (the capital of Kyrgyzstan) and her youngest son has a childhood disability. Her elder sons live independently and help Kaiyrsa to provide for herself and her youngest son.\r\n\r\nStill, Kaiyrsa decided to start cattle breeding in order to have an additional source of income and therefore applied for this loan. Also, according to Kyrgyz national traditions she has to celebrate her grandson\u2019s first birthday. Unfortunately, she doesn\u2019t have sufficient funds to do so. Only with the help of the loan will she be able to purchase cattle and to celebrate her grandson\u2019s birthday.\r\n\r\nThe other group members are:\r\n\r\nAltynbiubiu I. is the treasurer of the group. She is forty and married with two children: her son is fourteen and her daughter is five. Her husband is a forester while her elder son goes to school and her youngest daughter is at home. Altynbiubiu sells consumer goods, mostly office and school accessories. She started her business after her marriage upon the suggestion of her friend. Now, she is already six years in business after starting with an initial investment of 15,000 soms. She earns 9,000 soms each month from her business and, with the help of her husband, she also breeds cattle. With the profits from her business and cattle breeding, she is able to purchase household appliances and significantly increase the number of her cattle. Now she is planning to expand her business and therefore is applying for a loan which would help her to purchase additional cattle and purchase goods in order to the increase turnover of her business.\r\n\r\nChyngyz M. U. is twenty and single and lives with his mother and father, both of whom are pensioners. He decided to start cattle breeding in order to provide for his family. He is applying for a loan to buy cattle for fattening and sale.\r\n\r\nIshenbiubiu A. is sixty-two and married. She is a pensioner with a son twenty-four years old. Her son works at a local center of national education and receives 3,000 soms as a monthly salary. Ishenbiubiu is applying for a loan in order to start breeding cattle. She is planning to purchase cattle and hay for feed. With the help of her son, she will fatten the cattle for sale at a higher price. With the profits, she is planning to increase the number of her cattle. \r\n\r\n\r\n<b>--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---<\/b>\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance, a young and ambitious socially-focused MFI in Kyrgyzstan.\r\n\r\nMol Bulak Finance is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development on the basis of the 3-Ps concept - People (building human capital and taking care of its customers and the society as well), Profit (to be profitable in order to grow further) and the Planet (taking care of the environment).

She and her husband earn their living by operating two business ventures, a general store and an herbal medicine dealership. Milagros operates the general store and her husband, Papias Geromal, who is 34 years old, is an herbal medicine dealer. They have three children who are between the ages of 5 months and 14 years old. \r\n\r\nMilagros joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1999 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 12 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Milagros and her husband have been incrementally lifting their family out of poverty by the sweat of their brow. Her previous loan of 15,000 PHP helped her earn a monthly profit of about $280, raising the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 13th cycle loan, she is borrowing 15,000 PHP, which she intends to use to buy more stock to sell in her general store. She also wants to use part of the money to purchase a motorcycle to use for the business. She and her husband want to earn more money in order to save up for the future education of their children. Milagros G. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams.

She lives in her own home together with her husband Florentino, 49, and their two beloved children, whom they want to give a good education. Carmen's grocery store is one of the most visited in the city of Tarma.  She opens very early in the morning, waiting for the customers to come buy what they need. She is a very attentive and happy saleswoman; she always greets her customers with a smile and is always ready to help them with their purchases. What she likes most about her job is talking with her customers.  She has been in this business for 4 years and thinks the hardest part is having to be open all day long without being able to leave.  In the future, she hopes to be able to increase the size of the store and add more merchandise, so that she can offer her customers a better variety of products.  This is her 11th loan with MFP and she is ready to make all of her payments on time, since she doesn't want to cause problems for the village bank where she is very well liked by the rest of the members.  With the 3,000 nuevo soles that she has requested, she will buy more products so that she can better run her grocery store.

Sobirjon owns a 0.5-hectare field for cultivating rice in order to earn for living. On this plantation, Sobirjon now cannot do any planting because he does not have enough money for rice seeds. In order to deal with this problem, he decided to ask for a loan of 2500 Somoni to buy rice seeds to cultivate. He will use the rest of the loan to purchase fertilizers and fuel to support his field.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

After the collapse of the Soviet Union, most of the industrial factories stopped working, and there was little opportunity to work for the government. Alert people switched to commerce. They started to trade in various goods or opened their own businesses. Lots of people have gone abroad in search of work. Iqbol has been lucky, since she and her husband stayed in the city. They have been able to make their living in Kant. \r\n<p>\r\nHer husband is a builder. They are raising five children. The eldest daughter is thirteen, and the smallest son is just a year and half. Iqbol inherited a trade from her parents, making flat cakes. She invested $23 and started selling flat cakes at home. It has been six years since she started, and now she has a net profit of $95 a month. \r\n<p>\r\nIqbol\u2019s elder daughter helps her look after the little kids and also helps her knead dough. Her husband helps her buy and transport flour. Sometimes her children stay outside with Iqbol and help her sell the flat cakes. \r\n<p>\r\nCurrently, Iqbol needs a loan to purchase three sacks of flour, salt and yeast for baking flat cakes. She has big plans for expanding her business and helping her children get an education and get on their feet. \r\n\r\nIqbol\u2019s group partners: \r\n\r\nZebiniso, 38, is a builder\u2019s wife. She has six children. Zebiniso and her husband have recently collected beet crops. They also keep hens and sell eggs. They need a loan to buy a cow, so that they do not have to buy milk for their children. \r\n\r\nMukimjon, 48, trades in vegetables: potatoes, beets and radishes. He has three children. Mukimjon hopes to provide them with a good education and wants his daughters to marry. Mukimjon needs a loan to invest in purchasing vegetables wholesale. \r\n\r\nSalomat, 43, has four children. Her husband works as a builder. Salomat bakes and sells flat cakes. She hopes to obtain a loan to buy several sacks of flour. \r\n\r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance, a young and ambitious socially-focused MFI in Kyrgyzstan.\r\n\r\nMol Bulak Finance is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development on the basis of the 3-Ps concept - People (building human capital and taking care of its customers and the society as well), Profit (to be profitable to grow further) and the Planet (taking care of the environment).

While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\n\nMercy Joy is married and has two school-aged children. To make a living, Mercy Joy owns and operates a business venture raising livestock. The main source of income for the business comes primarily from raising pigs for sale. Mercy Joy has been engaged in her business for over ten years, and she earns approximately 20000 PHP every four months.\n\nIn 2009, Mercy Joy joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Mercy Joy is requesting a new loan of 12000 PHP, which will be used to purchase breeding livestock. This loan will be the third loan taken out by Mercy Joy from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay the tuition fees of her children. \n\nAbout ASKI: \nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\n\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

He is 48 years old, married, and has 2 children who are 6 and 4 years old. The 6 year old attends school. Tomas only studied through 7th grade, and didn't continue because of a lack of financial resources. He lives in his own home with his family and isn't responsible for supporting anyone else financially.\r\n\r\nTomas left Inhambane for Maputo when he went to fulfill the obligatory military service, and ended up staying there. He has received a pension from the Ministry of Defense for the past 18 years. His monthly pension is 3397.00 Meticales, which he uses to cover household expenses. He is sometimes able to save some money in his bank account.\r\n\r\nTomas has never taken out a loan with another bank. He found out about Hluvuku [the Kiva Field Partner] through friends who work with the institution. This is his 5th loan, for the amount of 15,000.00 Meticales. He plans to use this money to buy construction materials (cement, iron, sand and other items) in order to expand his house. His earlier loans were for 2500.00, 5000.00, 5000.00, and 5000.00 Meticales, and all were used for the same purpose.\r\n\r\nIn the future he would like to apply for more loans to finish his house and

This Kiva borrower is receiving a new ELA loan. The ELA program first provides disadvantaged adolescents, usually girls who are out of school, with livelihood training and financial literacy skills. Afterward, ELA participants can receive microfinance loans to expand their small businesses. These loans offer adolescents a unique chance to access finance at a young age and improve their prospects for the future, and target a segment of the population not typically served by traditional microfinance.

Paulina began to sell things when she was very young, originally in order to support her partner. Later, over time, this person looked for another place to live, but this was not an obstacle for her, because selling soda, cakes, pacifiers, and clothing very much helped her support her family with their expenses. Later she improved her capital, which she then invested in a supply of fruit on her little tricycle that was given to her, and she offered it in the area where she lives, although many times she had to travel to make her sales. Sadly, she got sick a little later and had to give up this business and start over with a different one. This time she bought a small supply of soda, detergents, milk, and rice in a small space where she lives. Very diligent and hardworking, she put up her kiosk in a corner of her house. She also works as a housekeeper in addition to washing clothes. Providing school education to her five children has been one of her goals and she hopes to reach it when her last child finishes high school. She will invest this loan in groceries such as sugar, milk, noodles, rice, and soda because that is what she needs.\r\nHaving her own house is her greatest dream as well as setting up a small, well-stocked store, given that she has been the guardian of a house for years. She is happy for the support provided by the Kiva loans to small people such as herself who really want to get ahead.

She works hard, year after year, farming.  She has had this work ethic since she was a child because her parents instilled in her the mentality to work hard in order reach the goals that present themselves in life.  For this reason, she managed to carry out her work in spite of the fact that she didn't have the support of family members to hire farm workers to help carry out the heavy labor.  \r\n\r\nEsther grows corn which, with the help of her children, she dries in a patio area outside her home and removes the kernels.  She then sells these by the kilo for a better price and makes more profits.  One of her goals is to improve her production and, over time, own a stable where she will keep dairy cows.  Whilst she is working on establishing that project, she continues working hard to make the profits she needs.\r\n\r\nEsther has worked with MFP on several occasions, taking group loans.  She stopped doing that for a time but is currently going back to working as part of a community bank because she believes it to be a positive experience working with people she trusts.

He lives on the south side of the city where he has a business selling beef and entrails by the pound.  He began his business over 30 years ago when he was a street vendor using a donkey for transportation.  His business expertise dates back from when he used to have a shoe repair shop in his home.  Now he distributes beef and entrails throughout the neighborhood and surrounding areas.  He buys at the public market at 4:00 a.m. and then at 6:00 a.m. begins selling liver, kidneys, udder, feet and tripe so the consumers have time to prepare their meals.  \r\n\r\nHe is applying for a credikiva which is his first loan through the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation.

Before owning her business, Jems Italian Ice, Eunice worked as a chemist in a research institution. She also added, now that she is married, she could not go home after a hectic day of work and expect to have some alone time. Then one day a friend, who was selling Italian Ice in Atlanta, suggested Eunice do the same. After she found it was profitable, she said she \u201cwent in it full force.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe small business, composed of family and friends, began when she lost her passion and felt the need to exit the corporate world. Eunice\u2019s family worked festivals for five years now as she helped them annually. As she recalls, working festivals gave them an opportunity to have conversations with 1000s of people. What attracted her the most to festivals were mainly the \u201cloving people and atmosphere.\u201d Eunice was raised doing community work and decided to do this and serve people in the community while having fun selling Italian Ice.\r\n\r\nEunice will use the loan money to purchase a large trailer for storage and transportation to save money on renting trailers. As a traveling vendor, Eunice noted that in order to participate in 2012 festivals, which normally begin in March, she needs to register in December. From here, she needs to begin booking hotels and planning trips. \r\n\r\nShe told of how Italian ice differs from traditional ice cream. Italian ice has \u201cfresher ingredients and is made with finer ice so it almost melts in mouth,\u201d she said. She juggles eight flavors that change according to what customers like.\r\n\r\nIt would have taken a year and a half to collect the amount of money needed. The loan from ACCION Texas allowed her to skip that process and dive into applying for festivals and ordering supplies. She can now attend large festivals instead of many smaller ones.

She works in this business because it is the only source of income for her family.

Being a very hardworking lady, she has faced some major challenges in life such as being a school dropout and having an inferiority complex because of a poor education standard. But she has gone on struggling to meet up with life against all these challenges. By so doing, she came to know of GHAPE in which she became a member in 2008, obtained a loan of 40,000 FRS, and repaid it successfully.\r\n\r\nGiven her new loan, M. plans to buy rice, waterfufu (cassava dough), beans, vegetables, oil and seeds for farming. The loan repayment will start from the day of disbursement. She is sure the business will succeed because of the training being given to her by GHAPE. Furthermore she has been doing the business for a long period of time. Notwithstanding, she has a ready market for her goods and she is quite sure the business will succeed. Her community will benefit from her activity by having food at their disposal, reducing their distance to the market in order to get what she is selling.\r\n\r\nDue to the progress of the business, M. plans to use the profit from the business to pay for her children\u2019s school fees, to expand the business and to feed the family. She prefers loans from GHAPE because GHAPE is trustworthy, the method of repayment is convenient, and GHAPE usually educates before giving out the loan. \r\n\r\n\r\n<b>About GHAPE<\/b>\r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon. GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach.

Jim\u00e9nez is 39 years old, is married, and has three young children. Two of her children are in primary school, and her husband works as a microbus driver. Maria has a business located next to the market where she sells cheese and fruits. She has sold cheese for more than 8 years, but it was not until 2 years ago that she decided to invest in the purchase of fruit and vegetables to sell in her space. She did this hoping to increase her income. She started this business with her husband's cousin, who invested capital. The loan will be invested in the purchase of more produce which will allow her to increase sales and thus her profits. Lately they have had problems because of the price instability of the products, and the financing will help handle those problems.

Navkiron is requesting a loan of 5000 somoni in order to buy another cow and feed. With additional income, Navkiron will be better able to meet his family's financial obligations and, especially, to provide for the education of his children. \r\n<p>\r\n<b>More about Tajikistan and IMON International:<\/b>\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its epic mountain passes and its rich history which includes its place as a key post along the Silk Road and events at the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has produced famous thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. A civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged an already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural productivity and the manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent viable business prospects. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He also wants to buy beans so that he has something else to sell, and wholesale fertilizer to provide his fields with the care they need.

They have three children, who are 19 to 26 years old and all have their own families. \r\n\r\nLolita joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2008 because she aspired to have something better for her family. With the help of her past seven loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Lolita has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 7,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 8,000, thus lifting the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her eighth loan, she is borrowing PHP 10,000, which she intends to use to purchase more stock for her general store so that she can continue to save up for the future and use it as additional capital for the business. Lolita C. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams.

She earns her living by operating 2 business ventures:  raising pigs and  selling ready-to-wear clothing. Her husband Leopoldo, who is 44 years old, works as a farmer to earn his living and also helps in his wife's business activities. They have 9 children who are 4 to 24 years old with 4 of their children already working while the other 4 are currently going to school. \r\n\r\nYolanie joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2008 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 4 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Yolanie has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 10,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 4,000, thus uplifting the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 5th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 13,000 which she intends to use as additional working capital so that she could continue to save up for future business expansion. Yolanie is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

This will be the third loan taken out by Ludy from HSPFI.

This is where she started her family together with Crispin; her husband of 29 years.  The couple have 7 children and, through their efforts, they have managed to provide them with what they need.  Now they are caring for their youngest son Rony.\r\n\r\nWith the calmness that she displays, Julia shaped her family.  Her main financial driving force and inspiration is \"farming\".  She has thirty years experience in growing avocados, bananas and citrus fruits.  This experience helped her to acquire everything that she has now: a comfortable home, business premises in Puente Paucartambo (a commercial area), a home in the country's capital city and 40 hectares of farmland.  She has all of this thanks to her continual work.  \"I do business on the farm\", she comments very proudly.  \"Twice a week, I send large quantities of avocados to the capital\", she adds.\r\n\r\nJulia would now like to invest in growing coffee since its price on the market has increased.  She has already taken her first step by setting up coffee nurseries, where she has thousands of seedlings growing which will later be transplanted onto her farmland.  She also sells seedlings for 400 Peruvian soles per thousand to third parties which makes her extra money.\r\n\r\nJulia is a member of the \"Luz del Futuro\" (Light of the Future) community bank and this is her seventh loan from MFP.  She hopes that you will help fund her loan so that she can continue achieving her goals.  On her part, she pledges once again to make her loan repayments on time as she has with her previous loans.  Julia enjoys being a member of her community bank because all the members are responsible people who are very supportive of each other.  With your support, Julia will invest the money she has requested in paying laborers to transplant her coffee seedlings onto her farmland."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":925,"image":{"id":789113,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to hire day laborers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-06-13T15:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":925,"lender_count":26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Julia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-05-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":367.84},{"due_date":"2011-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":386.23},{"due_date":"2011-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":405.54},{"due_date":"2011-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":425.82},{"due_date":"2011-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":447.11},{"due_date":"2011-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":467.46}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":136.1},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":142.91},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150.05},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":157.55},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":165.43},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":172.96}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":136.1,"local_amount":367.84,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:34:00Z","rounded_local_amount":377,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216550457},{"amount":142.91,"local_amount":386.23,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T09:12:33Z","rounded_local_amount":395.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221719137},{"amount":150.05,"local_amount":405.54,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-17T08:13:55Z","rounded_local_amount":415.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227350601},{"amount":157.55,"local_amount":425.82,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:48:12Z","rounded_local_amount":436.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232851041},{"amount":165.43,"local_amount":447.11,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:56:26Z","rounded_local_amount":458.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238666201},{"amount":172.96,"local_amount":467.46,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:43:03Z","rounded_local_amount":479.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244621336}],"funded_date":"2011-06-13T21:09:05Z","paid_date":"2011-12-15T10:43:03Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Oxnard","image":null}},{"id":310263,"name":"Wil Alfredo","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Will, tiene un taller de estructuras met\u00e1licas, vive con su esposa y dos hijas de 6 y 5 a\u00f1os de edad, solamente \u00e9l trabaja, \u00e9l aprendi\u00f3 en talleres y con experiencia instalo su propio negocio, tiene un horario de 8:00am a 4:00pm, su dificultad es el precio de la materia prima, pues constantemente suben los precios.\nActualmente necesita comprar hierro, lija, disco de pulidora, pliegos de l\u00e1mina, sierras y pintura, pues tiene un contrato pendiente por realizar, por lo que solicita un pr\u00e9stamo que le ayude a realizar la compra y por medio de ella realizar su trabajo.\n\u00c9l quiere crecer en el taller, con m\u00e1s clientela y al mismo tiempo que su familia tenga una mejor condici\u00f3n econ\u00f3mica.\n","en":"Will owns a metal shop.

The good yield he realizes is in general due to the seeds he uses. His current seeds have already been used for 4 years and are beginning to lose their productivity and need to be renewed or replaced by new ones. However, the lack of investment capital is a current problem. For this, Mr. A. is asking for a loan of $800 to buy selected seeds and fertilizers to revitalize his business.

To reap the reward, Ni Nengah Sulasmi needs to wait patiently for another 2 or 3 months for the little cows to mature and ready to be marketed.  However, Ni Nengah Sulasmi is very enthusiastic about her business that she bought a share of a male cow to increase her farm's production.  Most of Sulasmi's time is spent on farming her cows and pigs.  She is fortunate that her eldest son that just finished high school starts helping in the farm by procuring grass for feeds.  Ni Nengah Sulasmi's livelihood is dependent on her far,.  Her husband works as a contract labor without steady income.  Ni Nengah Sulasmi is planning to purchase a male cow that she plans to farm for 5-6 month to maturity and then sell for profit.

You still have to guide them and act as both mother and father to them. This is the experience of Mrs. Corazon O., a 57-year-old widow who lives in the village of Tuburan, in the town of Pontevedra, Negros Occidental. Four of her five children have their own families and earn their own living. The youngest is 21 years old and still lives with her while she is attending college.\r\n\r\nCorazon has owned and managed a pottery business for more than 30 years. She has a loyal clientele that patronizes her business because they know she produces high quality pottery in designs and colors that are suited to their taste.  But being successful can sometimes create problems - good ones!  Because of the high demand for her products, she ran short on working capital.  She did not want to miss the opportunity to expand her business, and this is the reason why she joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2004 - to have access to additional capital when she has large orders that require a lot of raw materials.\r\n\r\nIn addition to her pottery business, she diversified and opened a cafeteria so that she could earn additional income. In the five years that she has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon, she has maintained her good credit performance, and she earns on average a net profit of PHP5000 per month. Her last loan of PHP14000 was fully paid on time.  Now on her 9th loan cycle, she is borrowing PHP15000 to infuse more working capital into her business ventures. Her main objective now is to have her youngest son graduate from college and start his own life. Corazon is also starting to save for herself so that she will not be a burden to her children when she grows old.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the calling of not just of a few but thousands of women. Through the alleviation program, these women have progressed from earning less than a measly $1 a day, to surpassing the realities beyond their dreams. They have learned to live a life where they can finally be called honorable. This is Project Dungganon.

Ambos tienen 7 hijos, todos ellos menores de edad. Que con mucho amor y cari\u00f1o lo educan en su casa propia, ubicada en la comunidad nativa Centro Huachirick (selva central peruana). En la comunidad nativa, Julio es muy respetado entre sus pobladores; su capacidad de palabra y su buen trato lo diferencian; pues \u00e9l se desempe\u00f1a como alba\u00f1il. La construcci\u00f3n de las casas de la comunidad es producto de su ingenio y responsabilidad. Pero como todo hombre del campo. Julio se dedica, hace 15 a\u00f1os a la agricultura. El cultivo de caf\u00e9, palta y pl\u00e1tanos, son su principal actividad; los fines de semana, de cada 15 d\u00edas, visita su platanal, ah\u00ed cosecha los pl\u00e1tanos que produce y los comercializa en el mercado central de la ciudad de Pichanki. Pero lo que m\u00e1s le gusta a Julio; es poder incursionar en la siembra intensiva, eso quiere decir; poder cosechar en mayores cantidades, por eso para m\u00e1s adelante est\u00e1 pensando adquirir m\u00e1s mamones (plantas peque\u00f1as de pl\u00e1tano). Es el tercer cr\u00e9dito con MFP, por eso en cada reuni\u00f3n con su banco comunal, demuestra puntualidad en sus cuotas, as\u00ed manifiesta el agradecimiento por su progreso. Con el cr\u00e9dito que solicita, podr\u00e1 adquirir 2 mil plantaciones de caf\u00e9, con lo que podr\u00e1 renovar sus plantaciones; los cuales cuidar\u00e1n dentro de 2 a 3 a\u00f1os para que den fruto.\n\n","en":"Julio, 44, cohabits with Benedicta, 42.  They have 7 minor children that they educate in their own home, located in the indigenous community of Centro Huachirik (Peruvian central jungle), with much love and affection.\r\n\r\nJulio is highly respected by the residents of the indigenous community due to his trustworthiness and good way of dealing with people.  He works as a bricklayer and the construction of houses in the community is product of his ingenuity and responsibility.\r\n\r\nHowever, like all men from the countryside, he\u2019s been a farmer for 15 years.  His main crops are coffee, avocado and bananas.  On the weekends every two weeks he visits his banana fields where he harvests the bananas he produces to sell in the city of Pichanki\u2019s central market.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She works purchasing and re-selling cows with her husband. She has three children. She would like to request a loan of 850 USD for the term of 9 months in order to purchase additional cows to increase her inventory and meet customer demand. She believes this will lead to greater revenue and, ultimately, greater profit for her family. In the future, she would like to reinvest the earnings generated by this loan back into her business to purchase additional cows and increase their income further. She plans to use the increased income to fund her children\u2019s education.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \n\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

wants to provide her daughter with financial security. She is a 43-year-old woman, living in the village of Brgy. Canggapas Anahaw, Hinigaran, Negros Occidental. Melanie is married to Jose H., a truck driver who delivers sugarcane from the farm to the sugar mill. Driving a truck, in an industry that is known for its seasonality, cannot provide even a small family with a stable source of income. Even less, when the actual amount he receives for his labor is examined.\n\nWith no guaranteed income from her husband for part of the year to rely on for their family's needs, Melanie decided to earn her own living to supplement whatever income her husband earns and to provide their family with a more stable financial resource. When she was ready to start her business, she joined NWTF-Project Dungganon to access a collateral-free loan it offers, and used it to set up a general store. \n\nAs her earnings grew, and her customer base expanded, she saw another opportunity for expansion - offering electronic reloading to prepaid mobile phone subscribers, many of whom were already patronizing her general store. With the fast turnover of her business she was able to increase her income. She now earns a monthly average of 7,000 pesos from her general store. Her industriousness has paid off:  she is happy to report that her daughter has graduated from college.\n\nIn her previous 16th loan cycle, she was able to borrow 19,000 pesos which was used as additional capital for her business. She paid back all of the weekly installments on time, keeping her good credit rating with NWT-Project Dungganon. She is planning to borrow 19,000 pesos for her 17th loan cycle to support her general store and electronic reloading business.\n\nAbout NWTF:\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the call of not just a few, but thousands of women. Through the alleviation program, these women have progressed from earning less than a measly $1 a day, to realities surpassing their dreams. They have learned to live a life that can finally be called honorable. This is Project Dungganon!\n\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":395747,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

Despite her age, this is a very active and enterprising woman.  For the past 6 months she has risen early to prepare delicious fruit juices and fresh fruit extracts which she then distributes among her regular customers who, for the most part, are her neighbors.  For her, it is crucial to be able to offer a good product at a fair price since she is an honest woman who likes to do things always in the correct manner.  Besides, she believes this is a profitable business because she takes great pains to prepare juices that are her customers' favorites.\r\nIndalecia is a very hard working woman and she instilled this value into her children.  A few years ago she operated a toy store in her home but had to close due to personal reasons.  However, she dreams with being able to reopen it some day since she still owns almost all the equipment; her only lack is capital.  But, she has no shortage of will to work and get ahead.\r\nThis is her first loan with MFP and she assures us that she will be responsible with her repayment.  Among her immediate projects, and the reason she needs these funds, is to purchase modern juice extractors as well as natural dietary products to add to her breakfasts which she will offer in her toy store.  She smilingly states:  in future, to stay healthy, one must eat in Indalecia's toy store.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":409691,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Soft Drinks","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To purchase juicers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-10-20T00:00:14Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Indalecia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-10-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2010-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2010-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2010-03-13T08:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2010-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":165}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-11-14T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:54:39Z","rounded_local_amount":168.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103843058},{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-12-14T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T15:22:24Z","rounded_local_amount":168.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734634},{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2010-01-14T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:10:24Z","rounded_local_amount":168.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118124041},{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2010-02-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:48:58Z","rounded_local_amount":168.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123959717},{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2010-03-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:32:50Z","rounded_local_amount":168.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128992564},{"amount":57.75,"local_amount":165,"processed_date":"2010-04-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:37:24Z","rounded_local_amount":166.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136717350}],"funded_date":"2009-10-20T14:55:55Z","paid_date":"2010-05-15T11:37:24Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":149757,"name":"Fadi","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Fadi has been working as a fisherman since 1999.

Misamis Occidental. She is 48 years old. Carmelita is married and has one adult child. To make a living, Carmelita raises livestock. The main source of income for the business comes from raising pigs for sale. Carmelita has been engaged in her business for over three years and earns approximately 6,000 Philippine pesos a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Carmelita joined GDMPC, a Kiva partner, to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Carmelita has successfully repaid a previous loan of 3,000 PHP from GDMPC. Carmelita is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase baby livestock to raise and sell in the future. This will be the second loan taken out by Carmelita from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\n<b>About GDMPC:<\/b>\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three unit offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

When he started his own family he didn't waste any time in looking for an honourable way to maintain it. In this way William learnt to drive and 4 years ago started work offering a taxi service. At the beginning he used a rented car, but a year ago was able to buy his own car. William likes his job very much, as he is the boss of his time and works peacefully, especially in rush hour (the greatest demand and traffic) when there are more people that require his services. William is very satisfied because his work generates very good earnings that allow him to give his family a good quality of life. As he is a young man with a great desire to move forward, in the future he plans to buy another car and rent it out to generate more earnings.  \r\n\r\nThis is the fourth loan he has had with MFP and he is very thankful for all the people that have made it possible for him to obtain the loan to continue his progress. William plans to invest the money he is seeking in a technical revision (government mandated) of his car, which he must comply with as the law stipulates so he can continue working without a problem. \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jane McCrory, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":493804,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Taxi","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"Technical assessment of car","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"HUANCAYO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.066667 -75.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-02-23T06:00:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"William","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-02-17T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":152.91},{"due_date":"2010-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":157.29},{"due_date":"2010-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":163.86},{"due_date":"2010-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":169.65},{"due_date":"2010-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":175.2},{"due_date":"2010-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":181.09}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.52},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.05},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.35},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.38},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.32},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.38}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":53.52,"local_amount":152.91,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:33:30Z","rounded_local_amount":153.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128993290},{"amount":55.05,"local_amount":157.29,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:38:17Z","rounded_local_amount":158.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136718073},{"amount":57.35,"local_amount":163.86,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:40:07Z","rounded_local_amount":164.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144751748},{"amount":59.38,"local_amount":169.65,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:03:17Z","rounded_local_amount":170.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151934210},{"amount":61.32,"local_amount":175.2,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:37:18Z","rounded_local_amount":176.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159672985},{"amount":63.38,"local_amount":181.09,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:39:35Z","rounded_local_amount":182.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166886782}],"funded_date":"2010-02-26T09:48:11Z","paid_date":"2010-09-15T10:39:35Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jane McCrory","image":240040}},{"id":183249,"name":"Codou","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Codou G. est une femme de 41 ans, mari\u00e9e et m\u00e8re de 7 enfants.

In addition to her clothing business, she makes prepared meals at weekends that she also sells from her house and raises and slaughters pigs.  She started the clothing business while working at a job in a free-trade zone, first selling clothing to co-workers and then going on to selling full-time when she found that it was profitable.

For more than 18 years he has been involved in agricultural activities. He hires workers to work the land and finds help from his family with handling the money produced from the sales. \r\n\r\nLately, Nazirdjon has expanded into raising livestock, which he also sells. He buys young cattle and cows, and when they are grown and heavy, he sells them. The only thing that Nazirdjon is suffering from now is the lack of water and that is the reason that he applied to IMON for purchasing necessary materials to make a borehole. \r\n\r\nThis is the first time that Nazirdjon has requested a loan through IMON International; he has good references from his neighbors who consider him a responsible person.  \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He has been practicing mixed farming for the last four years. His farm produces maize, beans, tea and milk, which he sells locally. He is also employed as a teacher. His biggest challenges in farming have been diseases and pests that attack his crops and animals, an inadequate market and high competition.\r\n\r\nEvans is 30 years old. He is married with three children who are now between the ages of 2 and 10.

It was a hard blow to her, but Arzykan had to get it together and move forward. \r\n\r\nArzykan started selling vegetables at a local market. Her start as an entrepreneur was successful, but she handed the business over to her daughter whose own family was in need.\r\n\r\nAt that point, Arzykan decided to start her own business in cattle-breeding.  Using her initial capital of 15,000 KGS, she bought milch cows and started to sell milk.  Due to strong efforts, Arzykan has developed her farm and today she has two milch cows and 19 sheep.  Arzykan intends to use the loan of 60,000 KGS to broaden her business by purchasing one milch cow, which will allow her to sell more milk, and one horse.  \r\n\r\nIn future, Arzykan plans to hold her son\u2019s marriage and prepare a cozy home for his future family. \r\n\r\nBai-Tushum and Partners uses Kiva funding to target the especially vulnerable population.
