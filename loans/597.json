Pieza, Villaverde, Nueva Vizcaya. She is thirty-three years old. Cherry is the group leader of a five-member group loan offered by ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nCherry is married and has two school-aged children. To make a living, Cherry owns and operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising livestock. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for her business comes primarily from raising and fattening pigs for sale. Cherry has been engaged in her business for over two years and earns approximately 5,000 PHP a month for this work.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Cherry joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and to make her more capable of engaging in business activities. Cherry has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from ASKI. The previous loan was used to purchase baby livestock to raise for future sale. Cherry is requesting a new loan of 7,000 PHP, which will be her second loan from ASKI; she will use this loan to purchase livestock feed and other supplies. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve her family's general living conditions. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has twenty-five branches covering the central and northeastern areas of the Philippines. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolks, and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from raising pigs for sale. Marilyn has just started operating this business and earns approximately 5,000 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 1998, Marilyn joined NWTF to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Marilyn has successfully repaid a previous loan of 9,500 PHP from NWTF. Marilyn is now requesting a new loan of 11,000 PHP which will be used to purchase baby livestock to raise and sell in the future. The loan will be the 17th loan taken out by the borrower from NWTF. Marilyn plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business  to pay the tuition fees of the borrower's children.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc., has answered the call of not just of a few but thousands of women.

Nelly belongs to a group of entrepreneurs where she saves her money and has secured access to capital from ASHI. She appreciates that the organization has helped her improve her businesses and therefore her quality of living.\r\n\r\nShe has requested a loan of 20,000 PHP to pay for maintenance of their tricycle with some of the loan funds to be used to purchase necessary supplies for her store. She hopes to buy more tricycles in future for better output and so that her children can make their own living. She sees herself venturing into \u201cTalyer\u201d which means auto repair and a vulcanizing shop business in the next five years. Nelly is hoping that her envisioned businesses will help her to support the financial needs of her family so that they can move away from the nightmares of poverty.

Thanks to her desire to get ahead, she discovered that getting involved in sales would be a different but effective way to earn additional income.  She has worked in various businesses and knows a lot of people that she has been able to turn into clients for her new business selling shoes.  Many people have been interested in her products; she started in March 1998 by helping a neighbor sell shoes.  Cristina received a commission for each sale, and she slowly increased the number of clients.  Eventually, her neighbor couldn't supply all of the customers, so Cristina decided to start her own independent business.

She is married and the mother of four children. She lives with her husband and children. Currently all her children are attending school in junior and primary level. She has been a local manufacturer of soaps five years. Georgina combines materials like palm oil, soda powder, cocoa pods and coconut oil in the making of her soaps.

Her husband buys and sells wood from their cramped home.  Reyneria offers a wide variety of clothing for adults and children that everyone likes.  She sells her merchandise on different streets near where she lives and travels weekly to nearby villages or along the highway.  Reyneria has already been in this business for six months and has done very well because she does not many family responsibilities and only assumes the expenses for herself and her husband.  What she enjoys most about her work is traveling to different places and the social interaction with her customers.  Her business is very profitable because her products are sold every day and she only works based on the orders she receives.  Sometime later she wants to rent a space where she can open a clothing store.\r\n<p>\r\nThis is her second loan with MFP.  Reyneria likes her Communal Bank because there is a feeling of camaraderie and all the members are responsible.

In addition, she plans to build a small kiosk for selling cold beverages, such as sodas and beer.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":450651,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"Purchase a large quantity of clothing","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-12-17T23:20:17Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"lender_count":6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Reyneria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-11-16T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":151.02},{"due_date":"2010-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":157.06},{"due_date":"2010-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":161.46},{"due_date":"2010-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":171.24},{"due_date":"2010-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":176.17},{"due_date":"2010-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":183.05}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.86},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.97},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.51},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.93},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.66},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.07}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":52.86,"local_amount":151.02,"processed_date":"2009-12-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T15:22:33Z","rounded_local_amount":152.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734954},{"amount":54.97,"local_amount":157.06,"processed_date":"2010-01-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:10:26Z","rounded_local_amount":159.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118124277},{"amount":56.51,"local_amount":161.46,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:49:31Z","rounded_local_amount":163.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123960018},{"amount":59.93,"local_amount":171.24,"processed_date":"2010-03-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:32:56Z","rounded_local_amount":173.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128992863},{"amount":61.66,"local_amount":176.17,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:38:07Z","rounded_local_amount":178.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136717650},{"amount":64.07,"local_amount":183.05,"processed_date":"2010-05-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:39:32Z","rounded_local_amount":185.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144751336}],"funded_date":"2009-12-25T07:38:27Z","paid_date":"2010-06-15T09:39:32Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ronan Reodica","image":498323}},{"id":167109,"name":"Ismael","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El se\u00f1or Ismael al igual que su esposa son clientes distinguidos de nuestra Instituci\u00f3n ya que anteriormente hab\u00edan solicitado el cr\u00e9dito para el pago de unos gastos m\u00e9dicos, y ahora est\u00e1n tramitando este cr\u00e9dito para terminar la construcci\u00f3n de una barda en la parte trasera de su vivienda, para mayor protecci\u00f3n de la familia y del hogar. \nEl labora para un laboratorio medico y su esposa en una \u00f3ptica en el \u00e1rea del mostrador, son una familia joven pero muy unida y responsable. \n\n","en":"\r\n\r\nBoth Ismael and his wife are distinguished clients of our institution who have had loans with us in the past to pay for medical expenses.

She used her savings to open a stand in her home where she sells firewood. She can be found at her stand seven days a week, from very early until rather late at night or until her supply of firewood is gone. Juana presents an image of experience and friendliness, and a regular flow of customers visits her stand. She sells dry firewood at a low cost. Her husband Daniel is a driver.

They live in a commercial district located north of the city. Since he was young he learned to drive a car and later when he had a family to support, he never thought twice about providing taxi services in the streets of this great city. Many years have passed and he now has a steady source of income, especially because he does not only work with occasional passengers but he also has some steady clients that call him when they need to travel safely and securely. Additionally, since it is his own care that he drives he decides his own routes and his own schedule. He likes to work alone in the days and at nights he rests. Generally he starts work at 6 in the morning and finishes at 6 in the evening, only taking a break for lunch. This is a typical day for the hard working person. In the future he has planned to purchase another car and rent it out. This is a first time loan through MFP (Kiva Field Partner) and he is committed to making his payments on time. He does not want to disappoint the people that made this loan possible, a loan that will let him continue his work. Mario will invest the loan requested in the purchase of new tires for his car. The ones on his car now are very old. He will also bring his car to the repair shop for maintenance. This way he expects to improve the service he is able to offer.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Erika Lindig, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":604752,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Taxi","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"To provide his car with necessary maintenance.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:22Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mario ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-09-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":152.91},{"due_date":"2010-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":156.28},{"due_date":"2010-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":164.65},{"due_date":"2011-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":169},{"due_date":"2011-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":175.18},{"due_date":"2011-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":181.98}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.34},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.61},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":61.74},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.38},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.69},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.24}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":57.34,"local_amount":152.91,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T15:14:06Z","rounded_local_amount":160.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177449961},{"amount":58.61,"local_amount":156.28,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:01:28Z","rounded_local_amount":163.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182588660},{"amount":61.74,"local_amount":164.65,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T14:04:25Z","rounded_local_amount":172.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188725164},{"amount":129.07,"local_amount":344.18,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T08:51:50Z","rounded_local_amount":361,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195886663},{"amount":68.24,"local_amount":181.98,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:36:40Z","rounded_local_amount":190.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201326987}],"funded_date":"2010-10-05T23:27:37Z","paid_date":"2011-04-15T11:36:40Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":237340,"name":"Janeth","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Janeth D. is from the village of San Isidro, Medina, Misamis Oriental.

Now he is seeking a loan of 7000 somoni to purchase more juice and soft drinks to increase the stock he offers. Moreover, Tolibjon is hoping to spend a portion of the loan to buy insulation materials for his store to prepare it for the upcoming cold season.

However, he handled all these challenges well and is looking toward to the future with much enthusiasm and optimism. \r\n\r\n\r\n<b>More about Tajikistan and IMON International<\/b>\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country, known for its epic mountain passes, is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still lives in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The main source of income for the family is the fattening of cattle and agriculture. Zulfiya's daughters take care of the animals while her husband and her sons take care of the crops. Since they raise their own feed for cattle, the Samatov family save a lot of money. The feed crops are harvested by Zulfiya's sons.

They were able to use the proceeds to pay for their children\u2019s school fees, and to feed and clothe themselves and their children with the income generated from the loans. \r\n\r\nAgain, they are requesting a loan of Le 600,000 each to buy more goods to add to their businesses.\r\n\r\nHaja (on the left) is the leader of the group.

She has been a businesswoman for over twenty years.\r\n \r\nHaja sells articles like toothpaste, Vaseline, jewelry, fingernail polish, and baby powder. With this new loan, she will expand her business. She will buy at least a carton of toothpaste, a carton of Vaseline, a carton of powder and dozens of earrings. She usually travels to Freetown, where she buys the items that she sells. The fare to Freetown is Le 12,000. In Freetown, a carton of toothpaste costs at least Le 200,000, and it costs Le 150,000 for a carton of Vaseline and Le 150,000 for a carton of powder.\r\n\r\nSo far, Haja faces no serious challenge in her business that are worth noting.

This process requires multiple trips each day and wastes large amounts of time and money.

These loans have benefited her, allowing her to increase her inventory of products and offer a better selection to her clients, which in turn has allowed her to generate greater revenues for her family and improve their quality of life. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Julia Kastner, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1025,"image":{"id":465685,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Purchase of construction materials like Zinc and cement","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Condega","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 -85","type":"point"}},"partner_id":74,"posted_date":"2010-01-07T22:40:14Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1025,"lender_count":32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Martha Elena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-12-28T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":21000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":1639.63},{"due_date":"2010-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":1688.82},{"due_date":"2010-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1739.48},{"due_date":"2010-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1791.67},{"due_date":"2010-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1845.42},{"due_date":"2010-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1900.78},{"due_date":"2010-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1957.8},{"due_date":"2010-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":2016.54},{"due_date":"2010-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":2077.03},{"due_date":"2010-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":2139.35},{"due_date":"2010-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":2203.48}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.03},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.43},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.9},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.45},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.08},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92.77},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.56},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":98.43},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":101.38},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":104.42},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":107.55}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":71.98,"local_amount":1474.65,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:07:45Z","rounded_local_amount":1501,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118057464},{"amount":160.58,"local_amount":3289.84,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T08:39:32Z","rounded_local_amount":3348.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128925979},{"amount":85.12,"local_amount":1743.97,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:01:16Z","rounded_local_amount":1775.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144686217},{"amount":84.98,"local_amount":1740.96,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:34:56Z","rounded_local_amount":1772.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151869919},{"amount":85.73,"local_amount":1756.45,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-12T07:42:32Z","rounded_local_amount":1787.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159609517},{"amount":124.83,"local_amount":2557.73,"processed_date":"2010-08-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-12T07:42:45Z","rounded_local_amount":2603.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166823267},{"amount":56.84,"local_amount":1164.61,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-23T08:00:31Z","rounded_local_amount":1185.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172090385},{"amount":96.78,"local_amount":1982.89,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T13:23:57Z","rounded_local_amount":2018.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177381744},{"amount":97.07,"local_amount":1988.75,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T13:34:40Z","rounded_local_amount":2024.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182519399},{"amount":161.09,"local_amount":3300.15,"processed_date":"2010-12-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T12:43:23Z","rounded_local_amount":3359.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188653839}],"funded_date":"2010-01-10T06:20:37Z","paid_date":"2011-01-15T12:43:23Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Julia Kastner","image":343837}},{"id":171250,"name":"Chenda","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mr. Chenda Y.

The group members grow peanuts and okra.\r\n\r\nConcerned about making their plantations profitable, the group members decided to join the loan program of the micro-finance institution Soro Yiriwaso. They are now on their fifth farm loan.\r\n\r\nSALIMAI, who is standing second from the right in the photo, intends to use her loan to buy a sufficient quantity of peanut seeds, sundry supplies and equipment, and some farm inputs at the big market of OUELESSEBOUGOU.\r\n\r\nFollowing the off-season, the harvested crops are stocked for a certain time, so that they gain in value. And then they are sold retail (often in bulk) for cash at the big market of OUELESSEBOUGOU, BAMAKO, and at surrounding markets. The customers come generally from large cities.\r\n\r\nAfter selling the produce, the group members each plan on making a profit of 15,000 to 25,000 francs CFA that will be used for paying the loan interest and for typical family expenses.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":809305,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"to pay for farm inputs, seeds, and sundry supplies and equipment","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Digan","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:17Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Salimai ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Minata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Setou Tidjani","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Penin ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Siraba","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nagnouma ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sitan ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Niele ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bintou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Malado ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-06-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":250000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":250000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":550}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":550,"local_amount":250000,"processed_date":"2012-02-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-18T08:22:22Z","rounded_local_amount":251386.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263424580}],"funded_date":"2011-08-03T06:53:58Z","paid_date":"2012-04-18T08:22:22Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Daniel Kuey","image":669418}},{"id":319319,"name":"V\u00edctor Hugo","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"\nV\u00edctor Hugo de 46 a\u00f1os de edad, habita en casa propia con su esposa Mar\u00eda de 32 a\u00f1os y su hijo que por el momento se encuentra estudiando.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It is a united and dynamic group  as is demonstrated by their president who is married and has two small children, one of school age and the other a one year old baby. Norma sells food from the doorway of her house where she attends to some boarders and the local people. The loan will be used to buy tables and sunshades so she can serve her clients on her patio and she would like a cabin to make her customers more comfortable when it rains. She wants to grow her business so that she can finish building her house and put a better roof over the heads of her children. Her husband works as a chauffeur and helps his wife and hopes to have his own car so that he can work and improve his family's quality of life. The other members of the group sell sodas, coffee, cosmetics, clothes, and  sweaters, another serves customers in a beauty salon, and the one male in the group has his own locksmith business. There is plenty of competition in the markets within which they operate, but they rely on the speed with which they can change and supply their goods to be successful and get the income they need to support their families. The current loan will be used for operating capital and to buy supplies, raw materials, and goods to increase their sales and improve their families' quality of life. In speaking of their experiences, it can be said that the members used to work with other similar micro-loan institutions through the Foundation so they know how to administer the funds granted for the benefit of their businesses and for the improvement of the quality of life in their homes. \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Alison Hynd, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2075,"image":{"id":504898,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"Operating capital","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-17 -65","type":"point"}},"partner_id":73,"posted_date":"2010-03-13T19:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2075,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Norma Emiliana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dionicia Bertha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Miguelina Mercedes","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Claudia Alexandra","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ruth Maritza","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tomasa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mery Charo","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Cristina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ricardo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Zandra Roxana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-02-19T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":14500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":2075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":1740.76},{"due_date":"2010-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1760.79},{"due_date":"2010-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1781.05},{"due_date":"2010-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1801.55},{"due_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":1822.28},{"due_date":"2010-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1843.25},{"due_date":"2010-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":1864.46},{"due_date":"2010-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":1885.86}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":249.11},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":251.97},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":254.88},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":257.81},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":260.77},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":263.78},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":266.81},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":269.87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":500.99,"local_amount":3500.88,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T08:56:35Z","rounded_local_amount":3506.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128945065},{"amount":773.55,"local_amount":5405.55,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-12T08:09:44Z","rounded_local_amount":5414.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136673406},{"amount":263.78,"local_amount":1843.25,"processed_date":"2010-05-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-12T08:10:07Z","rounded_local_amount":1846.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144707454},{"amount":266.81,"local_amount":1864.46,"processed_date":"2010-05-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-12T08:10:30Z","rounded_local_amount":1867.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144707455},{"amount":269.87,"local_amount":1885.86,"processed_date":"2010-06-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-12T08:10:50Z","rounded_local_amount":1888.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151890973}],"funded_date":"2010-03-15T16:15:50Z","paid_date":"2010-08-12T08:10:50Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Alison Hynd","image":607121}},{"id":188210,"name":"Siony's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Siony B., 40, is from the village of Santiago.

She is married to Sime\u00f3n who is 33 and they have three children together.  They live in their own house in the community of Pampa Miraflores, a rural area in the District of Santa Rosa.  Reyna and her husband have many projects in mind, which is why they invested their savings in selling spare parts for all types of motor vehicles three years ago.  Their business is doing very well and there is greater demand from their customers.  They work closely together.  She likes this business since in addition to making a good profit, she is able to interact with people.  Her plans are to continue growing financially and to open another branch in other districts over time.  The loan requested is to obtain spare parts and lubricants.  This is her eighth loan with MFP and the money requested will be very useful for her.  She is a participating member in her communal bank.  With the 3,000 Peruvian Nuevos Soles (PEN) requested, she will buy accessories for her spare parts sales.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":741763,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Spare Parts","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy accessories for motor vehicles.

She is single and has two children who currently attend school. For the past four years, Elizabeth has been working hard to manage her salon where she does hairdressing for local women. Elizabeth's loan group is comprised of two hardworking women. \r\n\r\nElizabeth is requesting a 700,000 UGX loan to help expand her business and purchase equipment needed to do special braids. Her loan will help her generate greater profits and pay school fees for her children. Elizabeth hopes that in the future she will be able to own a boutique. \r\n\r\nElizabeth is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills training. The ELA program has increased Elizabeth's future prospects by helping her to improve her business.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":914212,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty

Edith  se dedica a la venta de productos de primera necesidad, para eso cuenta con una bodega que abri\u00f3 en su casa, comenzando con muy poca mercader\u00eda que logr\u00f3 comprar gracias a un peque\u00f1o capital que ten\u00eda ahorrado, luego con mucho esfuerzo y dedicaci\u00f3n logr\u00f3 hacerse conocida y ampliar su negocio.

Lo que le gusta de su actividad  es el poder socializarse, logrando hacer nuevas amistades, con los cuales puede intercambiar ideas; adem\u00e1s del ingreso econ\u00f3mico que le genera y puede apoyar con los gastos del hogar a su pareja que se dedica al servicio de mototaxi. Si embargo, los clientes le insisten en la venta a cr\u00e9dito, por lo que niega debido a la impuntualidad de pago.

She lives with Emilio and their three children, who are 14, 16, and 20 years old, in a house that they own.  They were able to purchase the house with a lot of effort. \r\n\r\nEdith works selling necessity items in a general store located in her home.  She started her business with very little merchandise that she was able to buy with money she had saved.  Later, with a lot of effort and dedication, she became well known and expanded her store.  She has had this business for 20 years.  Her children help her serve her customers, who are mostly her neighbors.  The thing she likes best about her business is being able to socialize and make new friends with whom she can exchange ideas.  In addition to the income she earns that helps with household expenses, her husband works as a mototaxi driver.

(Yes, I did double-check the name of the lending group, but I will leave it to you for the correct pronunciation.) Since Lugazi is in a very rural area, most of the members are in agriculture. Aisha is an exception. When I asked her what her business was she told me she was a \u201chawker\u201d. <p>\r\nOnce I understood what she was saying, I still had a problem with the word, since in my culture it is often deemed a business that has illegal connotations. But I did not want to change the word, since this is what she said, so let me clarify. A hawker is someone who sells there goods without the benefit of a fixed location. They therefore walk around busy markets and taxi parks carrying and selling their wares.  Aisha sells used clothing. This is not an easy job and most would like to be able to afford to rent a store front. There are many hawkers on the streets and they are seen as just as respectable as storefront owners, though not as well off. \r\n<p>\r\nAisha has been a hawker for two years and a member of her lending group for nine years, hence her position as chairperson. I got the feeling she has had a downturn in her life, but is determined to be able to rent a storefront. She is married and has three children.

She\u2019s married with two children. The difficult circumstances and hardships in her life made her recognize the value of work from a very young age. For about 12 years she has been purchasing young sheep and calves in the local market, fattening and selling them.<P>\r\n\r\n Risky is a very hard-working woman, and her diligence is incredible. She works with a strength worthy of immense admiration. She has always looked for a way to be an important protagonist by providing extra income to her home. Risky wakes up early every morning to feed her cows and bulls, with the goal of fattening them and selling them at the best price in the local market. She started this occupation because of the recommendation and teaching of her beloved mother. <P>\r\n\r\nThanks to this activity Risky is offering her children an education. Risky wants to keep educating them because she hopes that they\u2019ll reach the goals that they have laid out for themselves. With this purpose in mind, she is requesting a loan of 800 USD to buy calves in order to expand her business. Let\u2019s support this brave woman who has a lot of courage and strength to live! \r\n\r\n<P>\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International<P>\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and with its famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Lorna has successfully repaid a previous loan of 9,000 PHP from ASKI. Lorna is requesting a new loan of 12,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell.

He still works occasionally in the timber business when he is available, but that is only a minor source of income for him these days. He requested this loan from Juhudi Kilimo for Kes. 40,000 to start a poultry farming business.\n\nKaria is married with four children, ages 5, 8, 14, and 18 years old, all of whom are currently enrolled in school. It is hoped that the extra income from this loan will increase the family's overall well being and assist in paying the children's school fees. He wants to provide a comfortable life for his family so they do not need to constantly worry about finances.\n\nIn the future, Karia wants to purchase a vehicle so he can easily transport farm produce to market. He is hopeful for the future, and said that so far Juhudi Kilimo has provided a beneficial relationship.

Now she dedicates herself to raising and selling cattle, and with the income she generates she provides a better quality of life for her children, who are her greatest joy and have become her best friends.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<em><p>\r\nIMON's History<\/em>\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He lives at his parents' house, along with his daughter, Karol, of 2 years old.  Above all, he wishes to offer her a better future and for that he is willing to working very hard.  When he was a child, his parents taught him everything he needed to know about their small farm and little by little with the passing of time, he began to become in charge of his parents' land, since his older siblings decided to dedicate themselves to other professions.  Nowadays, he has an extensive amount of land to plant cacao and coco leaves.  After they are harvested, they are sold in the city of San Francisco.  What he enjoys most about his job is the cultivation because he knows that, luckily, with this activity he can support his family.
