It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The consequence has been grave, costing many jobs and with them, the only means many local people have for supporting their families.  Unemployment has forced many people to look for other means to make a living and microlending has helped.  Microlending allows people with few resources to develop and grow small businesses.  \r\n\r\nSonia is a hard-working woman who gets up every morning determined to become a little better off than she was the day before.  That's why she started a business in 2010, providing leased hygiene services, a business that now generates around S\/.42 [new soles] a day.\r\n\r\nWith the loan of S\/2,120 [new soles] that she will receive thanks to Kiva, Sonia will be able to buy a computer for her children.  She wants the computer so that her children can do their schoolwork at home.  They have to leave home now to go to a place where they can access the Internet and Sonia would feel easier if she could watch over them at home.  Her long-term goal is to expand her business and provide more services so that she can, in a few years, pay for improvements to her house."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":939728,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Utilities","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to

She simultaneously runs two side by side kiosks each selling very different products. In one she offers a selection of wall-paper and in the other she sells small animals and products and supplies for them such as cages, toys and food.\r\n\r\nNatalya is a delightful retailer whom people trust and respect. She brings much joy to children whose parents buy them small pets and necessary equipment. She assists many people in improving their homes by offering a wide variety of wall-paper in her other kiosk. Natalya\u2019s business strategy of having both kiosks side by side has helped her save the expense of hiring additional personnel to help her with retail. With 10 years of experience running these two different businesses, Natalya continues to reinvest profits into the development of her trade.  Also, as a mother, she strives to be successful so that she can see her son graduate from college. Paying for his schooling is currently one of her biggest financial priorities.\r\n\r\nNatalya is requesting a loan for $500 to expand her assortment of available wall-paper before springtime and the

She is a wife and mother of four kids. Currently all her children are in school. She enjoys selling goods, the business from which she makes a living. She has been selling yams for eight years now to support her family. She treks to farming communities to buy her stock of yams from the farmers.

She went to school up to 6th grade of primary school. She is married and she has 2 school age children who depend on her financially. \r\n\r\nKarina sells meals that she delivers to workers in the factories near her house. She also sells soda and beer, but says that the days she sells the most beer and soda are on weekends (Saturdays and Sundays). To prepare her meals, she buys food products such as: rice, vegetable stews, potatoes, oil, sugar, chicken, beef, duck, pork, etc. In the wholesale market she finds the lowest prices which she prefers. She orders the soda and beer from the supply trucks that go by her house. She buys them wholesale so she can get them at a lower price.   \r\n\r\nShe decided to start this buisness since no one near her house sold soda and beer.  This benefited her and she gained customers quickly. \r\n\r\nWith her first loan of 300.00 nuevos soles she bought cases of beer and soda wholesale. Now, with her next loan of  700.00 nuevos soles, she will buy cases of beer and soda wholesale and tables and dishes.

His farm produces bananas, tobacco, maize, sukuma wiki (kale), beans and tomatoes, which he sells to the local market. He also earns income from his rental houses in the same area.\r\n<br>Raphael recently completed his previous loan from Kiva partner, Juhudi Kilimo, and has requested this loan of 70,000 KES to purchase farm supplies and start a cereals business.

\u00e9l es un hombre muy responsable de 42 a\u00f1os que ha sostenido su hogar  trabajando independientemente, en un negocio que inici\u00f3   hace seis a\u00f1os impulsado por un amigo, propietario de un expendio y fue de aqu\u00ed donde se deriv\u00f3 su emprendimiento; Luis Enrique comenz\u00f3 vendiendo carnero semanalmente al detal a los vecinos del barrio y a los copropietarios de un edificio, donde prest\u00f3 el servicio de celadur\u00eda  y consigui\u00f3 muchos clientes a quienes hoy les vende de contado y a cr\u00e9dito a cortos plazos.\nSu meta a nivel familiar es  que alg\u00fan d\u00eda sus hijos sean profesionales  y su meta empresarial es aumentar su capacidad de compra pues quiere convertirse en mayorista  de ganado   y quiere cuidar su historia crediticia por eso es cauteloso cuando se trata del  pago de sus obligaciones, y est\u00e1 organiz\u00e1ndose para poco a poco  conseguir este prop\u00f3sito. Su credikiva es el primer financiamiento que hace a la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo porque requiere  adecuar la cubierta de su negocio,  para evitar que la temporada de invierno que ya se avecina,  pueda afectarle su actividad y con este cr\u00e9dito tambi\u00e9n comprar\u00e1  carne de cerdo, ganado vacuno y  gallina para la venta pues su mercado ha crecido y diariamente solicita que tengan diversos productos en su oferta, para atraer  a un mayor n\u00famero de clientes y que estos tengan de donde escoger de acuerdo a sus gustos y cultura alimentaria. \nCuando inici\u00f3 su negocio lo hizo mediante conexiones con propietarios de fincas y  vendiendo cerdo y gallipava alrededor de su vivienda, con el tiempo se dio a conocer en el sector y ahora no solo vende en el centro de Malambo, sino que en todo el municipio entre restaurantes  y otros clientes que compran al por mayor y con sus ingresos  poco a poco ha organizado su expendio, adicionando un congelador para la conservaci\u00f3n de sus alimentos,  con un pr\u00e9stamo que obtuvo con el que logr\u00f3 tambi\u00e9n enchapar las paredes. \u00c9l viaja los fines de semana para hacer las compras  a Cascajal, Ponedera,  Sabanagrande Puerto Giraldo y justamente en estos sitios ha conocido muchos propietarios de fincad, los cuales lo est\u00e1n motivando para comercializar su ganado y a Luis le parece una buena idea aunque planea hacerlo con calma.  Como muestra del alcance de Luis,  su organizaci\u00f3n y la proyecci\u00f3n que tiene,  hace dos a\u00f1os formaliz\u00f3 su microempresa y obtuvo el registro mercantil ante la C\u00e1mara de Comercio, para continuar ganando credibilidad en el mercado y oportunidades comerciales superiores a las actuales.  \n","en":"Luis Enrique lives in the community of Centro in the municipality of Malambo. He lives with his wife and their two children, aged 8 and 12. He is a very responsible, 42-year old man who has supported his household by working independently on a business he started six years ago. He was encouraged by a friend, the owner of an outlet, and that is from where he derived his own business. Luis Enrique started out sell ram's meat weekly to his neighbors in the community and to the co-owners of a building where he worked as a security guard. There he earned many clients and he completes his sales in cash and on short-term credit.\r\n\r\nHis goal for his family is to one day see his children have careers. His goal for his business is to increase his purchase capacity, wanting to convert into a cattle wholesaler. He wants to protect his credit history so he is cautious with his loan payment obligations and his is gradually organizing himself to meet his goal. This Kiva loan is the first loan he has accessed through Fundacion Mario Santo Domingo (Kiva Field Partner) and he requires it to recondition the roofing on his business, to be ready for the approaching winter season which could affect his business. He will also purchase pork, beef, and chicken meats to resell. His market has grown in the number of clients. He wants to offer them a selection according to their likes and to their gastronomical culture.\r\n\r\nHe started out his business through connections with owners of farms and by selling pork and turkey meat in his neighborhood. With time he got to know the business and today he not only sells in downtown Malambo, but also at the restaurants and other clients who buy in wholesale in the entire municipality. His profits he has been gradually organizing his store, adding a freezer to conserve his foods. He was also able to refinish the walls with a loan he acquired. He travels on the weekends to make his purchases in Cascajal, Ponedera, Sabanagrande and Puerto Giraldo and it is at these locations that he has gotten to know many farmers. They have been encouraging him to sell their cattle and he thinks it's a good idea, although he plans on taking his time. Given that Luis's goals are within his reach, his organization, and his projection for the future he formalized his business by registering it with Chamber of Commerce. He will continue to earn credibility in the market and to secure better commercial activities. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":850,"image":{"id":769513,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Butcher Shop","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to install a roof on his building.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Malambo-Atl\u00e1ntico","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2011-05-18T11:30:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":850,"lender_count":29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Luis Enrique ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-05-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":109489},{"due_date":"2011-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":114463},{"due_date":"2011-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":116656},{"due_date":"2011-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":118892},{"due_date":"2011-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":121171},{"due_date":"2011-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":123494},{"due_date":"2011-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":125860},{"due_date":"2012-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":128273},{"due_date":"2012-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":130731},{"due_date":"2012-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":133237},{"due_date":"2012-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":135791},{"due_date":"2012-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":141943}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.04},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.87},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.1},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.37},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.67},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":69.98},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71.32},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.69},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.08},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.5},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.95},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.43}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":62.04,"local_amount":109489,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:08:40Z","rounded_local_amount":112299.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216509494},{"amount":64.87,"local_amount":114463,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:49:34Z","rounded_local_amount":117400.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221673715},{"amount":66.1,"local_amount":116656,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-17T08:01:56Z","rounded_local_amount":119650.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227320278},{"amount":67.37,"local_amount":118892,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:06:33Z","rounded_local_amount":121943.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232803408},{"amount":589.62,"local_amount":1040500,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:16:49Z","rounded_local_amount":1067206.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238614486}],"funded_date":"2011-05-28T00:51:30Z","paid_date":"2011-11-15T10:16:49Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":302601,"name":"Jane","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jane is a dairy farmer from Kitale town in western Kenya, where she has been farming for seven years.

She lives in a traditional household with her husband and children in the 1st quarter of S\u00e9gou (fourth administrative region in the Republic of Mali).\r\nNot having attended school for societal reasons, she began working in business at an early age with her mother, who sold condiments and cereals. After several years of training at her mother's side, she eventually started her own business selling fruit and fruit juice. She has run this business for 20 years and has extensive experience and a large clientele. Her strong sales are due to the quality of her fruit and also to the taste of the juice she sells.\r\nTo make her juice, she uses 5kg of sugar, 10 packets of powdered juice, and 2 kg of powdered ginger, all mixed with 8 litres of water. She then pours the juice into plastic bottles and packets, which will be stored in a freezer before being sold.\r\nWith the goal of meeting her customers' demands, she turned to Soro Yiriwaso and has been working with this institution for 60 months. After 4 solidarity (group) loans and 3 individual loans, all repaid properly, she is on her fourth individual loan, which she intends to use to buy a freezer. She gets her supplies locally. Soumba sells her goods in cash and on credit to a clientele composed of women and men. She foresees realizing a monthly profit of 120,000 FCFA, which will allow her to repay her loan and participate in traditional social events. Her ambition is to build a home."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":808390,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Soft

She has been separated from their father for three years; even so, she feels better.  She lives with her parents, ages 86 and 84, in their home, and takes care of them selflessly.\r\n\r\nHer principal job is selling small animals, specifically guinea pigs, which she raises for four months and sells in the city of Lima.  \"Yes, this business is good for me, because I sell each guinea pig for 20 or 25 PEN, and every two weeks I take 50 guinea pigs,\" she explains.\r\n\r\nShe also buys cheese and honey and sells them in the capital.  In addition, she has plots of farmland where she grows peas, corn, and gladiolus.\r\n\r\nAlicia considers her main problem to be poor time management, which previously caused her to neglect her crops.  The lack of workers to work her crops is another problem she has resolved over time.\r\n\r\nShe hopes to be able to build a house of fine wood in the future, thanks to her savings and the tireless work she does every day.  Alicia has worked with MFP and her communal bank, Nueva Esperanza, for 13 loan cycles.

She is an itinerant vendor of anything that goes with the season. She buys and sells everything from candies and other food items to small toys for kids. She endures the daily strain of buying all her stuff from the commercial district and carrying it all by herself.  \r\n\r\nHer inspiration for doing this hard work is her six children.

To do this, each morning from the early hours he works on his fields to cultivate his potatoes, corn and peas to give them the necessary care so they can be quickly brought to market.\r\n\r\nWhat he likes most about his job is to plant, since he knows that his income depends on this activity.  He has been farming for 7 years, and what he considers most difficult is to care for his crops when there are abrupt changes in the weather that affect his productivity.  In the future he hopes to buy more land to increase his production.\r\n\r\nThis is Javier's 8th loan with MFP, and he knows that the money from the loan will be very beneficial to the development of his business.  In his communal bank he is a very responsible member, and as a result is well-respected.  With the 1,500 Peruvian soles requested he will buy pea seeds, fertilizer and insecticides so that he can have a good harvest.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Lisa Grobar, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":504096,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy seeds, fertilizer and insecticides      ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-03-11T17:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"lender_count":1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Javier","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-02-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-27T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-27T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":1500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":550}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":550,"local_amount":1500,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T14:04:51Z","rounded_local_amount":1568.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188724602}],"funded_date":"2010-03-11T18:47:38Z","paid_date":"2011-01-15T14:04:51Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lisa Grobar","image":264298}},{"id":187882,"name":"Javier Ernesto","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El se\u00f1or Javier Ernesto D.

She is a proud single mother of 4 children but currently only lives with one of them: Marco, aged 11.  She educates and raises her son in her own home which is located in the town of Palca.  As a single mother, she confirms that she has a lot of strength and vitality for getting ahead in life.  \u201cI have to work twice as hard and be an example for my children\u201d she comments.\r\n\r\nThrough her hard work and determination, she has managed to get most of her children ahead in life, since farming is her main support.  She grows potatoes, peas and other vegetables which make her a good income each harvest season.  Carmen has been in this business for 5 years and the wholesale purchasers in the central market of the city of Tarma know her as a determined and optimistic woman.\r\n\r\nHowever, in order to support the university education of her other children, two years ago Carmen also started selling sweetened apple water and other drinks made from 'maca' flour and soya flour which she sells together with pieces of bread.  This business is very profitable and now she would like to adapt her sales stall so that her customers feel comfortable.\r\n\r\nThis is Carmen's third loan with MFP and she feels very happy for all the support which her community bank has provided her with.  She is planning to use her loan to buy several sacks of fertilizer for her potato crop.  She will also buy 100kg sacks of flour for her business.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":654155,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy sacks of fertilizer and 100kg sacks of flour","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:39Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":725,"lender_count":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Carmen ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-11-17T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":725}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":725,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-17T08:13:21Z","rounded_local_amount":2036.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227350945}],"funded_date":"2010-12-02T06:27:06Z","paid_date":"2011-09-17T08:13:21Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Oxnard","image":null}},{"id":257540,"name":"Baara Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Baara  est un regroupement de dix femmes toutes mari\u00e9es dans des familles conjugales traditionnelles \u00e9largies avec leurs fr\u00e8res, s\u0153urs, co-\u00e9pouses, enfants et \u00e9poux.

She is originally from Macho D. Agua located in the state of Michoacan.  Nazaria is 30 years old and states that she only completed 5th graD. in elementary and did not go on any further because her parents had minimal resources and could not buy her the books.\r\nShe is known as \"Naza\" by her friends and neighbors and dedicates herself to raising and selling sheep.  She is a very hard working person and takes her sheep to graze at a very early hour to a plot where she and her husband plant grass for their animals to eat. She states that with the loan she will purchase more sheep, feed, vaccinations, parasite medication, and vitamins so that the sheep grow quickly for her to sell at a good price.  She has been doing this for 2 years and started in this type of business because she says it is profitable and they are easy to raise and you don't have to invest too much into this type of animal.  She sells her sheep locally and sometimes takes them to auction in Zitacuaro.  Nazaria's goal is to build them a shed so they won't be cold and so they won't get sick.  She is married to Genaro who is 38 years old and is a day laborer.  They have four children who are sponsored by Vision Mundial (World Vision).  She states, \" Thanks to World Vision my children have a better quality of life and also thanks to Fundacion Realidad ( Reality Foundation) because this way I have a source of employment to help out my husband with household expenses and with the kids.\"\r\nAugustina is part of the group, \" Los Espinales\" and originates from Macho D. Agua, Michoacan.  She is 38 years old and studied until 3rd graD. and did not continue her education because she helped her parents out by working and didn't have enough to cover her school expenses; also her dad would tell her, \" women were born to work around the house and take care of the kids, not be out in the streets so called \"working\", that is why they have their husbands to support them.\", and that is why he wouldn't let her continue studying.  Augustina is soliciting a loan from Fundacion Realidad ( Reality Foundation) to purchase more sheep and increase her livestock to facilitate their sale in bulk, she also adds that she will be purchasing feed and vitamins.  She has been at this business for 3 years and sells her sheep to a client in Zitacuaro who makes barbacoa ( mexican food ).  Augustina is married to Leonidas who is a day laborer and they have 5 children.

Los verdes campos de su centro poblado de Santa Rosa, ubicado en la selva tropical Ayacuchana, han sido en la vida de Erika un lugar muy agradable para trabajar, desde muy peque\u00f1a sus padres le ense\u00f1aron esta labor  y ahora ella tiene sus propias tierras en las que trabaja junto a su pareja con mucho esmero, sembrando caf\u00e9, cacao y Pl\u00e1tano. Lo que m\u00e1s le gusta de su trabajo es cosechar sus tierras, ya que as\u00ed siente que su arduo trabajo tuvo sus frutos. Lleva 10 a\u00f1os realizando esta actividad y considera que lo m\u00e1s dif\u00edcil es transportar sus cultivos hasta los centros de acopio situados en la ciudad de San Francisco. Erika solicita el pr\u00e9stamo para realizar unos de sus planes, incrementar sus sembr\u00edos con plantas de cacao ya que es una de sus plantas que mayor  precio tiene en el mercado. Con el tiempo, espera juntar el dinero suficiente para comprar nuevas tierras. Este ser\u00e1 su segundo cr\u00e9dito con MFP y en esta oportunidad espera contar una vez mas con el apoyo de los financistas ya que gracias al aporte de ellos va progresando. Y ello Erika esta llano de devolver puntualmente sus aportes. Con los 2,500 nuevos soles, comprar\u00e1 semillas de cacao y as\u00ed aumentar su producci\u00f3n.\n\n","en":"Erika is 41 years old.  She is a cheerful and hard-working woman who lives in her own home together with her partner, 37 year-old Jos\u00e9, and her two beloved children, 13 year-old Jos\u00e9 and 8 year-old Ruth, who are the motivation behind all her efforts.\r\n\r\nThe green fields of Santa Rosa, in the Ayacucho rainforest, have been a very pleasant place for Erika to work.  Since she was very young, her parents taught her to farm and now she owns her own land which she works very carefully together with her partner, growing coffee, cacao and bananas.  What she most enjoys about her work is harvesting her land since then she feels that all her hard work is providing its rewards.  She has been in this business for ten years and she considers the most difficult part of her work to be transporting her crops to the middlemen in the town of San Francisco.\r\n\r\nErika is requesting this loan to carry out some plans.  She will increase her plantings with cacao plants since this is one of her plants which fetches the highest price on the market.  Over time, she hopes to gather together enough money to buy more farmland.  This will be her second loan from MFP and, on this occasion, she hopes to be able to rely on Kiva lenders' support once more since, thanks to their support, she has been making progress in her business.  Erika, for her part, is prepared to make her repayments punctually.  She will use the 2,500 soles to buy cacao seeds and thereby increase her production."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":925,"image":{"id":818139,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy cacao seeds","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-07-24T12:10:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":925,"lender_count":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Erika ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-07-04T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":271.81},{"due_date":"2011-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":284.72},{"due_date":"2011-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":297.42},{"due_date":"2011-11-05T07:00:00Z","amount":305.96},{"due_date":"2011-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":318.72},{"due_date":"2012-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":328.75},{"due_date":"2012-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":339.93},{"due_date":"2012-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":352.69}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100.57},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105.35},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":110.04},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":113.21},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":117.92},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":121.64},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125.77},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":130.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":100.57,"local_amount":271.81,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-17T08:12:31Z","rounded_local_amount":275.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227350757},{"amount":105.35,"local_amount":284.72,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:49:12Z","rounded_local_amount":288.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232851121},{"amount":110.04,"local_amount":297.42,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:56:56Z","rounded_local_amount":301.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238666298},{"amount":113.21,"local_amount":305.96,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:42:13Z","rounded_local_amount":309.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244621455},{"amount":117.92,"local_amount":318.72,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:50:11Z","rounded_local_amount":322.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250835529},{"amount":121.64,"local_amount":328.75,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:18:13Z","rounded_local_amount":332.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257245291},{"amount":125.77,"local_amount":339.93,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:31:06Z","rounded_local_amount":344.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263385414},{"amount":130.5,"local_amount":352.69,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:30:11Z","rounded_local_amount":357.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270098537}],"funded_date":"2011-07-24T20:09:12Z","paid_date":"2012-04-15T10:30:11Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Oxnard","image":null}},{"id":323106,"name":"Pedro Reynaldo","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Este cliente es originario de comarca el jicarito es maestro del colegio del mismo nombre, tiene 27 a\u00f1os de laborar, su n\u00facleo familiar  consta con 2 personas su esposa que tambi\u00e9n es maestra del mismo n\u00facleo educativo y su hija quien estudia en el colegio de la misma localidad, actualmente tiene 13 cr\u00e9ditos recibidos con la empresa, este ultimo ser\u00e1 utilizado para la compra de impresora , cocina de gas y Refrigeradora, ya que de esa manera ha venido mejorando sus condiciones y nivel de vida.","en":"Pedro is a native of the El Jicarito region.

She is 52 years old, married and has four children who all live on their own. She makes a living raising pigs and chickens and also works in the fields. She learned the trade from her parents, who raised her on a farm and had her working since she was very young. That knowledge has helped her make headway for her family. Today, she and her husband have crops and raise livestock. She is requesting the loan to purchase two young cows so she can sell their milk, which is in high demand in her community.

Her major monthly expenses include medication, school fees and feeding the family. She has been in this business for the last ten years. Her main challenge is the rainy season, which stops her daily routine of moving door to door.

It was the location for the end of Alexander the Great's rule, and is known for its great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country, with its epic mountain passes, is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mix of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the USSR, damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 per cent of the country is mountainous and only 7 per cent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands of people to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>More about IMON International<\/b><br>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition.

To make a living, she owns and operates a business venture in the food sector making and selling food. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from preparing and selling barbecue pork and chicken. Lilia has been engaged in her business for over five years and earns approximately 4000 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Lilia joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. She is requesting a loan of 5000 PHP which will be used to purchase raw ingredients needed to make products for sale. This will be the first loan she has taken out from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve her family's general living conditions. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 29 branches covering the central and north-eastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Luis is a taxi driver.  They also live with their two young children, and they help her with the business.  They live together, and they have a great desire to get ahead.  They live to the north of the city.\r\n\r\nFor four years she has been selling food every day.  Most of her customers are workers for a business that is near where they live.  Every day she gets up at dawn to prepare her dishes.  At noon she distributes the dishes that were ordered the previous day.  She feels satisfied with her work.  It allows her to obtain regular earnings, and it helps her husband with the steady household expenses.\r\n\r\nShe also raises two cows and three dozen chickens.  She gets fresh milk daily, and she sells the eggs.  This enterprising woman plans to expand her business of selling food and set up a rural restaurant.  In the place where she lives there is no one who provides this service.\r\n\r\nThis is her first loan with MFP.  She pledges to make her payments on time.

Upon harvest, they are planning on a production of 1.32 tonnes of peanuts and 4.5 tonnes of sorghum.  The produce is sold in cash at the Bougouni marketplace.  Their customers are composed of men and women. \r\n\r\nWith a price of 300 francs CFA per kilo for peanuts and 100 francs a kilo for sorghum, the group members each hope to obtain a profit of 40,000 francs at the end of the crop year.  Their profits will accordingly be used in revenue-generating work to keep them busy during the dry season.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":330134,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"To buy minor supplies and equipment for farming and planting ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Bougouni","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.416667 -7.483333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:23Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":750,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Djatou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Assitan ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Djoba ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alima ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gnanan ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Safiatou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Adiaratou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bintou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ramata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kadidia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-05-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":345000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":345000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":750}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":750,"local_amount":345000,"processed_date":"2010-01-19T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-22T13:03:06Z","rounded_local_amount":347170.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118152130}],"funded_date":"2009-07-02T17:29:46Z","paid_date":"2010-02-22T13:03:06Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Daniel Kuey","image":669418}},{"id":117408,"name":"Myra","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Myra M. is a resident of Barangay Lamo Dupax del Norte, Nueva Vizcaya.

Karina hopes to continue to finance her university studies with profits from this little business, in which she also invested her very first loan of 300 soles (about $100) from Manuela Ramos.  \r\n<P>\r\nKarina is very thankful for the financial support from Manuela Ramos.  She is committed to being responsible with her loan and punctual in her payments.

She has had her business for almost 6 years, starting with an initiative to have a business, with which she can help her family. She plans to use this loan to invest in her business where she sells gasoline and motor oil on the road close to her home, and to buy clothing to sell. She will use the profits to reinvest in the business and to save, because she wants to improve her standard of living. \r\n\r\nThis Esperanza associate began with us because she believes everybody is involved with her in this loan; they are like family. Her  story is representative of her group and of Esperanza's Haitian and Dominican clients (many of whom recently emigrated to the DR from Haiti) generally. Her group is located in Samana, a lush rugged peninsula with a nascent tourism industry. This area, like nearly all impoverished areas of the Dominican Republic suffers from unreliable running water (none of which is potable) and

The official name of this borrowing group is Rosita D. C.'s Group.\r\n\r\nTo make a living, Rosita owns and operates a general store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from selling a variety of different products in the local community. She has just started this business.\r\n\r\nIn March 2010, Rosita joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. She is requesting a loan of 5,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional inventory and provide working capital. This will be the first loan that Rosita has taken out from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve her family's general living conditions.\r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in north-western Mindanao.

Wilfredo did not finish his studies because he didn't have enough money for his education, so he is doing his best to earn a living.\r\n\r\nWilfredo has been involved in agriculture for almost 30 years. He devotes his time to maintaining his rice fields to increase his income. He is thankful that his wife is supportive in improving their lifestyle. She raises hogs and helps Wilfredo with his farming activities. \r\n\r\nWilfredo would like to purchase certified seeds, fertilizer, and insecticides, but he cannot afford them because of the high cost of basic commodities. In addition, he lacks sufficient income to pay for the labor costs of sowing, transplanting, and tilling the rice farm. He is therefore asking for a loan of PHP 20,000. With this loan, he hopes to improve their financial status and standard of living.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":270888,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

After her parents died and she became an orphan at age 12, Mrs. Nancy started to work as an assistant seamstress of Polleras.  She was able to save enough money to buy her own sewing machines to make the Polleras by herself.\r\n<p>\r\nThis loan will be used to purchase sewing material (fabric and spools) to be able to meet the increasing demand for her high quality products.

Her day usually starts at 8:00 in the morning and ends after 6:00 in the afternoon. During this time she uses a few minutes when sales are slow to go see her son who studies a few blocks from her business. What she likes most about her work is the freedom that she has to do other activities while she is managing her sweets cart. She has eight years in this activity and thinks that the most difficult part of her work is having to remain under the harsh sun all day. \r\n\r\nFor the future she hopes to be able to have a store where she can serve her clients better and offer them a greater variety of products. \r\n\r\nThis is Paula's first loan with MFP,  so she feels the responsibility of making her payments on time, since she wants to have access to credit in the future. In her community bank she is one of the most active members. With the 800 new soles she has requested, she will buy more sweets to improve her cart's inventory.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Daniel Burke, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":390537,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Increase her merchandise","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Juliaca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15.5 -70.133333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-09-18T14:30:14Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":300,"lender_count":4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Paula","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":800,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":133},{"due_date":"2009-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":133},{"due_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":133},{"due_date":"2009-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":133},{"due_date":"2010-01-29T08:00:00Z","amount":133},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":135}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.88},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.87},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.88},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.87},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.88},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.62}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":49.88,"local_amount":133,"processed_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T02:58:35Z","rounded_local_amount":144.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96997544},{"amount":49.87,"local_amount":133,"processed_date":"2009-11-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:53:13Z","rounded_local_amount":144.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103842891},{"amount":49.88,"local_amount":133,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:56:45Z","rounded_local_amount":144.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103842892},{"amount":150.37,"local_amount":401,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T15:24:31Z","rounded_local_amount":436.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734468}],"funded_date":"2009-09-18T14:42:13Z","paid_date":"2010-01-15T15:24:32Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Daniel Burke","image":11816}},{"id":142070,"name":"Pashton Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Pashton is the group leader of the Pashton group, which has three members.

T. (17) is a 47-year-old woman living in the town of Thanh hoa. Ly is the group leader of a five-member group loan offered by Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women.  While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they all are responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.  The official name of this borrowing group is 09.2.2 Nam Ngan (02.09.2.2).\r\n\r\n\r\nLy is married and has three adult children.  To making a living, Ly owns & operates a business venture in the retail sector running a general store.  The main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling a variety of different products in the local community.  Ly has been engaged in this business for over five years and earns approximately 1,500,000 VND a month from these activities.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Ly joined Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Ly has successfully repaid a previous loan of 1,963,500 VND from Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women.  This previous loan was used to invest in expanding the business.  She is now requesting a new loan of 6,000,000 VND, which will be used to invest in expanding the business.  The loan will be the third loan taken out by the borrower from Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women.  Ly plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of the borrower's family.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout the Other Borrowers in the Group:\r\n\r\n\r\n1.

She has traveled a lot in Mali, Mauritania and also around the Gambia to purchase fabrics and other goods for sale.  It is an activity that she inherited from her grandmother and mother who lived in Dakar and who practiced the business.  More so, it was her grandmother that entrusted her with merchandise to sell around Tambacounda where Mariama lived, until she found love for the business.

Starting at 4pm, she sells coffee and warm pancakes until 11pm.  Her business is doing very well, but when 5pm arrives, there are times when she runs out of supplies.  Lately she has been working with her niece as her assistant and sometimes with her daughter.  By working in this manner, Agripina has been able to provide her children with an education and build part of her home, which makes her feel like she has accomplished something.  She enjoys her business because it is profitable and allows her to be independent.  For this reason, Agripina continues to work so that she can add another room to her house which she will make available for rent.

Agripina promises to complete her payments on time because she does not want to disappoint two of her fellow group members with whom she works with all the time.

From this business she sells articles of clothing, shoes, and accessories for both men and women. She has 3 years' experience and she has been the owner for the past year. Yoliva started her business as a great opportunity. She started out as an employee, working for the first two years. When Yolima took over the reins, managing the business, the owner was motivated to sell her the business when she was going to relocate. And she bought it by making payments. She makes her purchases in the cities of Bucaramanga and Medellin. Her business operates with a steady client base, passers-by, and especially with the population in the sector. Her plan is to develop a new sales strategy. The plan consists of giving buyers the opportunity to lay way the product they wish to buy with an initial payment. The person can make payments until the full price is met and at that time they receive their product. Yolima wants to expand her business and she wants to invest to improve the selection and to supply it to meet the emerging needs of her clientele. For this reason she requests a Kiva loan. It is the first loan she accesses through Fundacion Mario Santo Domingo (Kiva Field Partner). She will purchase articles of clothing, shoes, and ladies' accessories. Financially speaking, this burins enjoys steady sales which are generally completed in cash. The current assets represent cash and credit sales.
