Initially, Parniati aimed to run a second-hand clothes business, but this business will require her to move from one market to another market according to the market schedule. She then decided to run a food-stall business as she realized that not so many people run a similar business at the Lili Market, which is situated not far from her residence. \r\n\r\nTo run the business, Paniati borrowed money from a cooperative with daily repayment. The interest rate charged was quite high, but Parniati didn\u2019t have another option. Due to the limited capital that she has, Parniati couldn\u2019t improve her business.

They have eight children, two of them are below the age of fithteen. She is now separated from her husband and lives in a two-room house with two persons per room in the Elemighong quarter in the Belo subdivision. Her first loan was given to her in 2010 and she invested it in the purchase of irish potatoes and beans to sell.\r\n\r\nJuliana is requesting her second loan from GHAPE to do farming and also to buy irish potatoes, corn, fowls, tobacco and kerosene to resell. She plans to use the loan for 120,000 FCFA to buy irish potatoes for 30,000 FCFA, maize for 50,000 FCFA, fowls for 20,000 FCFA, tobacco for 10,000FCFA, kerosene for 10,000 FCFA.  She thinks she will succeed because she is always available at her business site to serve her clients and she makes sure her goods are always available for her customers at moderate prices. The loan will help the community since she sells what the people want. \r\n\r\nJuliana has faced challenges in her life.  One of her children had died, she felt sick for a long time, and her children ran and stayed in the bush for a night. The profit she will get from this loan will be used to pay tuition fees, hospital bills and food for the family. She prefers a loan from GHAPE because repayment can be made bit by bit, the interest rates are low, and GHAPE also gives out a training series on loan management.\r\n\r\nAbout GHAPE \r\n\r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon.  GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach.  Every client is trained in business management, basic health, life skills, financial management, profits and losses, and family values.  Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement.  GHAPE instils a sense of family and community within its clients and staff and has developed a strong bond of trust between the organization and its clients."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":789773,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

He has a cart on which he keeps fruit and he visits different areas and streets in order to sell it.  He will invest the loan in order to buy seasonal fruits in large quantities for reselling and generating more revenue. \r\n\r\nHe has been operating his business for the past seven years and Maqboolan

<p>Miguel is not only a successful farmer, he is the leader of the Primero de Agosto Asssociation that is comprised of Rice Farmers from Santa Lucia. He is one of the main organizers of their communal bank, having the responsibility of organizing the members and being the liaison with Mifex. He is also a very efficient rice farmer who has gained the respect of the community for his dedication to helping others. He will use the loan, like the other members of the communal bank, to purchase the necessary materials to plant and cultivate rice.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>The Primero de Agosto Communal Bank in Santa Lucia<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Miguel is part of one of the newest Communal Banks in the recently developed Mifex Rural Finance Program: the Primero de Agosto Communal Bank.  All bank members are part of the Association of Rice Farmers in Santa Lucia, and they will use these microloans to prepare their lands and cultivate rice on their farms. As members of a communal bank, they are all guarantors for each other's loans. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the Primero de Agosto Association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many microfinance programs, but Mifex believes that is imperative for the communities we work with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Below is more information about the commnity of Santa Lucia, compiled by Luis Crespo and Robert Edgar of the Mifex team when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. Special thanks to Mario Balazantegui who provided expert insight and contributed to the development of the alliances with the local organizations. <\/em><\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Economy of Santa Lucia<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Santa Lucia County has a population of about 33,000 people. The region is fit for rice cultivating because it is not in the lowlands and therefore it is not at risk of flooding. There is also great access to water because of the Daule River, which is accessible to many of the farmers in the area. About 70% of the farmers have basic infrastructure for watering their crops. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rice production is the main economic activity of the area, as about 80% of the people are rice farmers. Almost everyone is either directly or indirectly involved with the rice production, as they produce, commercialize or participate in activities that add value to the product. Within the county, there is a small town also named Santa Lucia. The town is filled with many small businesses and it serves as the social and commercial hub of the area.  <\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Rice Farming in Santa Lucia<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Most of the people in the Santa Lucia area are small farmers. They produce about 100 sacks of rice per hectare of land. In order to farm they first must prepare the lands by removing weeds and plowing. The farmers then fill an area with water to form what is known as a paddy field, because rice is a very water intensive crop. The rice seeds are either dispersed freely (the process is known as <i>boleo<\/i> in Spanish) or hand sowed. Once the rice has grown, most farmers rent machinery that helps them harvest their crop. A risk factor does exist in rice farming because of drought, but in Santa Lucia this is somewhat mitigated by the access to water form the nearby river.  <\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Access to Credit<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The biggest struggle in the area has been the lack of credit. Because people do not have access to formal financial services, they have turned to loan sharks for financing. They have been affected by expensive lines of credit that exceed 100% interest a year and can be as expensive as 240%. Intermediaries also exploit the farmers because of their outstanding debt. Farmers also often lack skills and knowledge of how to commercialize their product and get fair prices for their crops.  <\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Loan Use<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The loans in this sector will be used to to buy soil, seeds, fertilizer and insecticides. They will also be used to prepare the land prior to farming, to plant the seeds and purchase other materials. The loan repayment schedule is different from the typical microentrepreneur. Because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures, Mifex asks them to repay 50% of the capital in the first 6 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the seventh and final month. <\/p> "}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":19381,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Plant and cultivate rice","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Santa Lucia","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.183333 -80","type":"point"}},"partner_id":7,"posted_date":"2007-03-13T19:28:00Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1200,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Miguel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-03-30T10:54:14Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1200,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":1200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":171.42}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":171.42}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":172,"local_amount":172,"processed_date":"2007-06-08T09:15:16Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T06:49:34Z","rounded_local_amount":172,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":21381},{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-08-09T23:21:21Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T06:49:34Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":40787},{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-08-22T18:17:30Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T06:49:34Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":45306},{"amount":812,"local_amount":812,"processed_date":"2007-12-18T18:15:40Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T06:49:34Z","rounded_local_amount":812,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":99060},{"amount":100,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2008-01-02T22:00:43Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T06:49:34Z","rounded_local_amount":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":106820}],"funded_date":"2007-03-16T10:54:14Z","paid_date":"2008-01-02T22:00:43Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":10532,"name":"Bi","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Bi is 38 years old.

He wants to use the loan money to buy fertilizer and pesticide to be used at his paddy field.<p>\r\nI Putu is a hard worker and he believes the importance to work really hard for his paddy field in order to enable him to get maximal result so he can improve his family's well fare, to put on saving and also to repay his loan on time.\r\n<p><b>Translated from Indonesian by Antonius Gunadi, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\n\r\nI Putu Sugama tinggal di desa Manistutu, sebuah desa di Bali Barat yang mana hampir 90 % penduduknya bermata pencaharian sebagai petani. Khusus untuk lingkungan I Putu Sugama, sebagian besar petani bercocok tanam dengan menanam padi. Hal ini disebabkan karena pengairan diwilayah tersebut mencukupi untuk menanam padi. I Putu Sugama memiliki lahan seluas 1 hektar yang ia kerjakan seorang diri.\r\nPada masa tanam saat ini, tanaman padi sangat membutuhkan pupuk dan anti hama untuk menjaga kwalitas yang didapat saat panen nanti. I Putu Sugama membutuhkan dana untuk membeli pupuk dan anti hama yang diperlukan karena semua dana yang dimilikinya sudah diinvestasikan untuk pengolahan sawahnya. Dengan pinjaman yang didapatnya, akan dipergunakan dengan sebaik \u2013 baiknya untuk pengolahan sawahnya. I Putu Sugama adalah pekerja keras, sawahnya dikerjakan dengan baik karena ia ingin mendapatkan hasil yang maksimal, sehingga dengan hasil yang maksimal ia bisa mencukupi kebutuhan keluarganya, menabung dan mengembalikan pinjaman tepat

This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro-leasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the

He is married and has been blessed with 3 children. His children are: Thobias R., 18 years old; Merry Rasi, 15 years old \u2013 in Junior High School Grade 3; and Marthen R., 13 years old. Both Thobias and Marthen are not at school because they want to help their father (Zakarias) to earn money by farming. In this village, Zakarias works as a farmer who finances his family and the education of his children by selling banana, coconut and cassava. Sometimes the daily income that he earns is not enough to meet his family's needs. This is the reason why Zakarias wants to run another business. He is requesting a loan amounting to Rp 3,200,000 to buy cattle to be fattened.  Zakarias is interested in joining the cattle fattening program because he can benefit by the profit of the cattle sale. He has a dream to send his children to the university. \r\n\r\nThe other members of this group also face the same situation as Zakarias faces. Their income from farming is not enough to meet their family's needs. And like Zakarias, they also want to improve their standard of living by running another business.

It served as a key post along the Silk Road and marked the end of Alexander the Great's extensive rule. It was the birthplace of the great Persian poet Rudaki and famous Islamic philosopher Ibn Sina. And it is home to epic mountain passes, communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>IMON\u2019s History<\/b>\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

They have one child who is 17 years old. \r\n\r\nDesa joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2000 because she aspired to something better for her family. With the help of her past 16 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Desa has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 19,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 10,000, thus uplifting the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 17th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 19,000, which she intends to use as additional working capital so that she can continue to save up for the future, fund her child's education, do house repairs and buy home appliances. \r\n\r\nDesa is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means \"honorable\").

He is married and has three children with two of them currently in school. For the past five years, Stanley has been working hard to manage his poultry business. He sells chickens in the local market. \r\n\r\nTo help expand his business, Stanley has requested a loan of 2,000,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda.

At the moment the breeding pig is only tied to a tree because she doesn't have a hut. The 2 piglets are farmed inside a small simple bamboo hut.\r\nIn 6 month, she can get a net proceed of IDR 2 millions (approx. USD 210). This farming business provide significant support for her family. \r\nWith the future loan, she would like to build a larger permanent pig hut so all of the pigs can be farmed inside the hut.\r\n<p><b>Translated from Indonesian by Antonius Gunadi, Kiva Volunteer. <b><p>\r\n\r\nWalaupun dengan  kandang bambu yang sederhana, Ketut Suartini tetap berkeinginan membantu suami dalam memenuhi kebutuhan rumah tangganya. Karena hasil suami yang didapat dari bertani, tidak mencukupi  biaya sehari hari. Dengan modal  pinjaman yang ada, Suartini membeli 1 induk babi dan 2 ekor bibit babi penggemukan. Setiap hari Suartini memberi makan babi peliharaannya sebanyak 3 kali. Tak lupa juga kandang disiram agar bersih dan segar, sehingga babi peliharaannya bisa sehat dan gemuk. Makanan yang diberikan berupa pakan dedak gandum yang dibeli di toko, kadang juga dedaunan untuk makanan tambahan. Induk babi hanya diikat dipohon karena belum memiliki modal untuk membuat kandang. 2 ekor bibit babi dikurung dikandang bambu. Dalam enam bulan Suartini bisa maraup keuntungan Rp.2.000.000,- bersih dari hasil induk dan bibit babi. Usaha ini sangat menunjang biaya hidup Surtini, bahkan untuk kedepannya Suartini ingin membeli bibit lebih dari 2 ekor. Agar usahanya bisa maju dan berkembang. Dengan pinjaman yang didapatnya nanti, Suartini juga berencana untuk membuat kandang yang permanen dan lebih besar lagi sehingga semua babinya tinggal didalam kandang dan bisa berkembang biak dengan baik."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":125731,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To

Hasanboy has dedicated himself to raising livestock. He is married and a father who needs to support his children, who no longer need his help to complete their studies. His wife also helps him with the business. \r\n\r\nHasanboy needs to purchase calves. To commercialize the derivative products, he sells the raised animals to farmers who then resupply the small farmers with calves. To acquire the animals to start the cycle, Hasanboy has come to IMON International to obtain the necessary credit. In this way, he will continue to maintain his dear home.\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and with it\u2019s famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

His mother encouraged him to have his own business and she supported him with the capital he needed to set up his own telephone call center a year ago.  Since then he has been able to take advantage of his earnings, buying more modules for the phone center.  He started with just one, and now has expanded to five modules.  He wants to keep growing his business and to add some internet stations as a complement to the services he offers and to earn more, because he would like to be able to study for a professional career.  To be able to reach his goals he needs to work hard and get up early to take care of his business, which he opens at 8 am and closes at 10 pm.

Ese barrio es muy tradicional y famoso por ser el escenario de uno de los mejores desfiles folcl\u00f3ricos que se realizan en la semana del 11 de noviembre, cada a\u00f1o. La microempresaria se dedica a fabricar fritos como empanadas, arepas, deditos de queso y bu\u00f1uelos. El negocio comenz\u00f3 hace 15 a\u00f1os por recomendaci\u00f3n de su mam\u00e1 e impulsada por el hecho de querer generar otros ingresos familiares. Al principio utilizaba s\u00f3lo un caldero peque\u00f1o, pero con el incremento de las ventas debi\u00f3 comprar otros implementos de cocina m\u00e1s grandes. Actualmente emplea a dos mujeres que le colaboran en preparar todos los ingredientes que llevan los fritos. Todos los d\u00edas la se\u00f1ora Martha se levanta a las 3:30 de la ma\u00f1ana para iniciar su jornada laboral, porque debe entregar su producci\u00f3n a 7 tiendas del barrio y una cafeter\u00eda antes de las 8 A.M.

This neighborhood is very traditional and famous for being the scene of one of the best folk parades which takes place on November 11th every year.\r\n\r\nThis small businesswoman makes fried goods such as empanadas, 'arepas' (corn fritters), 'deditos de queso' ('little cheese fingers') and doughnuts.  She started her business 15 years ago.  It was her mom who suggested the business and Martha was motivated by the fact that she wanted to make some additional family income.  At first she used only a small pot for preparing her food but as her sales increased she had to buy other, bigger cooking implements.  She currently employs two women who help her to prepare all the ingredients for her fried goods.\r\n\r\nEvery day Martha gets up at 3.30am to start her work day because she must deliver her goods to seven stores in the neighborhood and a cafeteria before 8.00am.\r\n\r\nThis is Martha's fifth loan from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo and she plans to invest it in buying an industrial stove, a refrigerator and supplies for preparing her food.  She sells on average 250 fried products at 500 Colombian pesos each.  Her profit margin is 40%.  Martha informs us that, thanks to her business, she is able to help her husband with their household expenses, provide her daughter with a good education and also some small conveniences that she never had when she was a little girl.  She believes that the success of her business lies in the quality of the ingredients that she uses and knowing the right temperature at which to have the cooking oil when she fries so that everything turns out delicious and crispy."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":678981,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Catering","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To buy an industrial stove, a fridge and supplies for preparing her products","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Cartagena de Indias","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2010-12-27T16:30:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1100,"lender_count":37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Martha Cecilia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-12-15T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":2100000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":153285},{"due_date":"2011-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":160248},{"due_date":"2011-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":163319},{"due_date":"2011-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":166450},{"due_date":"2011-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":169640},{"due_date":"2011-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":172891},{"due_date":"2011-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":176205},{"due_date":"2011-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":179582},{"due_date":"2011-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":183024},{"due_date":"2011-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":186532},{"due_date":"2011-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":190108},{"due_date":"2011-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":198716}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":80.29},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.94},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.55},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.19},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":88.86},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.56},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92.3},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":94.06},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.87},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":97.71},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":99.58},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":104.09}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":80.29,"local_amount":153285,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T03:39:18Z","rounded_local_amount":153759.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191427759},{"amount":83.94,"local_amount":160248,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-16T08:40:39Z","rounded_local_amount":160744.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":196001186},{"amount":85.55,"local_amount":163319,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:08:53Z","rounded_local_amount":163824.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201289207},{"amount":87.19,"local_amount":166450,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:04:17Z","rounded_local_amount":166965.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206157349},{"amount":88.86,"local_amount":169640,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:18:24Z","rounded_local_amount":170165.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211230359},{"amount":90.56,"local_amount":172891,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:49:16Z","rounded_local_amount":173426.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221673445},{"amount":116.93,"local_amount":223239,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:07:21Z","rounded_local_amount":223929.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232803148},{"amount":109.9,"local_amount":209812,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-17T08:55:53Z","rounded_local_amount":210461.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244568227},{"amount":165.91,"local_amount":316742,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:06:49Z","rounded_local_amount":317722.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250779572},{"amount":190.87,"local_amount":364374,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T10:20:18Z","rounded_local_amount":365501.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257188848}],"funded_date":"2010-12-28T01:06:04Z","paid_date":"2012-02-15T10:20:18Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Oxnard","image":null}},{"id":265425,"name":"Nadera","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Nadera is the mother of two daughters and two sons.

By working hard in her business, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She earns an average monthly income of 5,000 Philippine pesos (PHP). Teresita is borrowing 10,000 PHP so that she can fund her business operations. This will be her fifteenth loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of 19,500 PHP (which she paid off well within its term) was just another step on her journey toward economic freedom. Teresita hopes to improve her family's living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the <i>Dungganon<\/i> way.\r\n\r\n<b>About NWTF:<\/b>\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means <u>honorable<\/u>).

He lives with his wife and their two children (ages 16 and 4 months) in Ciudad Bicentenario, a large-scale housing and intervention project undertaken by Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  The mission of this project is to build self-sustaining communities.  \r\n<p>\r\nIn this community, Deivis offers car wash services.  He started this business because he needed a way to earn household income.  Deivis decided to offer his services to vehicles that travel along the main avenues of the city.  Being a young man with many aspirations started to give him more purpose.  As soon he completed courses in polishing and maintaining vehicle exteriors, he became certified as a technician to work in this type of business.  His skill is demonstrated through the great care he takes in making his business grow.  Going forward his goal is to have his own location where can he can attract more business, offer more effective services to his customers, and generate more income to help him provide for the welfare of his family and pay for a quality education for his children.  \r\n<p>\r\nThis Kiva loan is his first with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.

She farms a small plot of land in the green, lush hills of Kitale, which in the Rift valley region of Kenya. Ruth is happily married and is blessed with a lovely family. For the past 10 years, she has been involved in mixed farming and she grows maize and vegetables. She also has dairy cows. Ruth has been able to provide nutritious food for her family. She earns profits selling a variety of food crops, but she is faced with the challenge of delivering the produce in a timely manner to the market. This challenge has not made her give up and she states: \u201cI have to do something for my family\u201c. Ruth joined Juhudi Kilimo which is a micro finance institution that assists aspiring women like her. She requests a loan from Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva lenders to buy a motorbike. Ruth is from a remote village that has poor roads and transporting her produce to the market has been a challenge. She has suffered many losses of perishable products (milk, vegetables, and tomatoes) which require timely delivery to the market. This loan will help Ruth to achieve her dream and reach her goals. Accessing a financial solution for women in Kenya is an uphill battle, but Ruth feels relieved to know that there are institutions such as Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva that help women to gain respect and equality among their male smallholder farmer counterparts. The benefits of this loan are many because Ruth will never suffer losses due to delay in delivering produce to the market.

In 1998 she joined TYM and her first loan was 30.00 USD to raise and sell chicken and raise pigs with average monthly income of 42.00 USD. After 10 years borrowing from TYM, she invested in retail business and raising animals which provided her family with a stable income and greatly improved their livelihood, Presently her family has a house located right on Highway 3 so she opened a shop selling refreshment and repairing cars and motorcycles. She also raises geese and chickens, and no longer has to sell at the market. Her children are now grown and are employed with outside companies. Their family's average monthly income is 605.00 USD and with the loan term of paying weekly, she finds it very agreeable. She herself has always been exemplary in carrying out the stipulations of the fund, and is always eager to assist other women in the group. Thus during her time with the fund, the other women liked and trusted her and elected her into the management group.

This year he is not doing as well as he planned, but he needs to marry off his daughter and needs to prepare a dowry for her.  He decided to take out a loan to repair his car and to drive it like a taxi with a fixed route.  He is planning to convert the car so that it runs on gas and the car will run on gas instead of on gasoline.  Gas is cheaper than gasoline, this is why he thinks this would be profitable.  His wife also works, she sells pastries on the street.

The competition they face is considerable but the members have a great deal of experience and know how to prosper their businesses, offering a variety of high quality products. The loan they are requesting is to be used as working capital to invest in their small businesses, and to increase their earnings. This translates into a better quality of life for their family, improving more and more every day.  They are very grateful for the trust that has been placed in them and they are even more motivated to work hard. The members are currently in their first loan cycle but they have previous group experience.  They promise to give all that they have to prospoer responsibly and together as a team.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Erika Lindig, Kiva

Makula is 36 years old with three children, aged two to nine years old.  Currently, the nine year-old is in 2nd grade. She is Muslim and is from Guinea where schools at the time were not available for girls. Thus, she is illiterate. Makula's husband is a fisherman but doesn\u2019t earn enough to support the family.  She now lives in nearby Borkeza Town in a refugee camp because the town was burned to the ground during the war.  \r\n\r\nMakula\u2019s business consists of selling fish wholesale in the market in a stall alongside approximately 10 other vendors.  She has been running her business for three years.  In the dry season, fish are plentiful so she sells her husband\u2019s catch, but in the rainy season she needs to purchase fish wholesale to sell in the market.  She is requesting a loan for this fish purchase and also to buy additional baskets and bags to transport them.  She is successful because her customers like the way she prepares her fish for consumption.  Her dream is to grow her business to be a year-long business, unlike those who go out of business during the rainy season.  With the profits from her business, Makula dreams of building a permanent shop for her year-round business, sending her children to school, and building a house for her family.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":380242,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish Selling","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To purchase additional fish and to buy baskets for transporting them","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"LR","country":"Liberia","town":"Lofa Co.

a daily income from her business operations. She lives in the village of Brgy. 111, Hinigaran, Negros Occidental. She is married to a motorcycle driver and they have three children who are between 21 and 30 years old. Noly has always dreamed of a more comfortable life for herself and her family.\r\n\r\nShe had to do something to help her husband earn a living because his income from driving a motorcycle, shuttling passengers, was just not sufficient to sustain their family. So Noly started her own eatery, offering different kinds of food to her regular customers. In spite of the small income she earned from this business, she persisted because it helped their food needs.\r\n\r\nTo improve her business and be able to earn a bigger income, she joined NWTF-Project Dungganon 2001. With the additional capital from her loans, she was soon able to expand her business to include a general store. She has been in business for over 25 years already, but it is only now with the help of NWTF-Project Dungganon that she is finally achieving some success in her business. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 9,000 from her business operations, allowing her to set aside some savings for their future.\r\n\r\nIn her previous loan, she borrowed Php 17,000 and used it as working capital for her eatery and to buy more stock for her general store. Even at her age, she maintains her good credit performance by paying her loan in full and on time without any delays. Now she is borrowing for her 16th cycle loan, the same amount of Php 17,000 to be used to buy motorcycle spare parts to repair her husband's source of his livelihood and also as additional capital for her general store and eatery.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress out of earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":428341,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

Los arduos d\u00edas de trabajo que Delia tiene en su chacra, le han servido para mejorar sus cultivos y hacer m\u00e1s productivas sus tierras, junto a la m\u00e1s joven de sus hijas trabaja desde muy temprano por la ma\u00f1ana, cultivando papas y habas, productos que posteriormente llevar\u00e1 a vender al mercado mayorista de la ciudad de Tarma. Paralelamente a esta actividad, tiene una tienda, en donde abastece de v\u00edveres a todo su poblado. Lo que m\u00e1s le gusta de su trabajo es sembrar sus tierras y ver como crecen sus plantaciones. Es as\u00ed que lleva 30 a\u00f1os realizando esta actividad y considera que lo m\u00e1s dif\u00edcil es fumigar sus sembr\u00edos, puesto que los qu\u00edmicos que utiliza para eliminar a las plagas, son altamente da\u00f1inos para su salud. Con el tiempo, espera comprar m\u00e1s tierras y as\u00ed ampliar su producci\u00f3n.

Yusely is her main help when working on the farm and what she wants most is to improve Yusely's quality of life.  \r\n<p>\r\nThe arduous work days that Delia spends on the farm have improved their crops and made their land more productive. Alongside of the youngest of her daughters she works from very early in the morning, growing potatoes and beans, products that they will then sell in the wholesale market in the city of Tarma.  In addition to this job, she has a store where she sells foodstuffs to the people of her village. What she enjoys most about her job is sowing the land and watching her crops grow.  She has been working in the fields for thirty years and thinks the hardest part is having to spray the crops, since the pesticides are highly damaging to your health.\r\n<p>\r\nWith time she would like to be able to buy more land and increase her production.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Oguis, Danao City, Cebu. She earns her living by fattening pigs and with an abaca [fiber from abaca palm leaf] weaving business. Her husband, Eduardo E., age 53, works as a construction worker and also helps with his wife's business. They have three children who are 11 to 16 years old. One has a family while the other two are going to school. \r\n\r\nDelma joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2009 because she wanted something better for her family. With the help of her past three loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, and by the sweat of her brow, Delma has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty. Her previous loan of 9,000 Philippine pesos (PHP) helped her earn a monthly profit of 4,000 PHP, thus improving the family's standard of living. This time, for her 4th loan, she is borrowing 12,000 PHP, which she intends to use to purchase feed and vitamins so that she can continue to save up for the future and for her children's education. Delma E. is a <i>Dungganon<\/i> woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.\r\n\r\n<b>About NWTF:<\/b>\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means <u>honorable<\/u>).

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Sharon's business is selling all types of women's clothing which she receives from an aunt who lives in the city of Lima.  She sells the clothes to her friends and neighbors either for cash or on two week's credit.  She has been in this business for one year and it has enabled her to make income which has helped her to buy household items and appliances.  For this reason, she would like to expand her business and open a clothes store in a commercial area of the city of Pucallpa which will make her more income.\r\n\r\nThis will be Sharon's second loan from MFP and she hopes to receive your cooperation so that she can carry out her plans.  For her part, she pledges to make her repayments on time as she did with her previous loan.  Sharon will invest the 1,000 soles she has requested in buying more women's clothing so that she can enjoy a better profit margin."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":930317,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"to buy more women's clothing","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-11-26T12:10:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sharon ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-10-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":146.2},{"due_date":"2012-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":153.05},{"due_date":"2012-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":166.86},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":173.09},{"due_date":"2012-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":176.11},{"due_date":"2012-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":184.69}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.83},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.39},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.57},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.91},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.04},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.26}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":54.83,"local_amount":146.2,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:50:46Z","rounded_local_amount":148.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250836209},{"amount":57.39,"local_amount":153.05,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:19:18Z","rounded_local_amount":155.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257245972},{"amount":62.57,"local_amount":166.86,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:30:33Z","rounded_local_amount":169.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263385995},{"amount":64.91,"local_amount":173.09,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:29:02Z","rounded_local_amount":175.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270099085},{"amount":135.3,"local_amount":360.8,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:29:57Z","rounded_local_amount":365.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283202126}],"funded_date":"2011-11-29T22:20:04Z","paid_date":"2012-06-15T18:29:57Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Oxnard","image":null}},{"id":367921,"name":"Rechel","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rechel is 30 years old and lives in the Philippines.

Her older son is a teacher and her younger son is in grade 7. Her two daughters are studying in grades 11 and 8 respectively.\r\nMrs. M. opened her grocery shop 4 years ago. She sells different types of grocery items such as rice, maize, pulse, biscuits, and noodles in her shop. Her children also help her in her work. The demand for grocery goods is increasing in that area so she is requesting her second loan of Rs 15000 to buy grocery items to meet the demand.

To make a living, Gloria owns and operates a farm which is planted with different kinds of plants, especially rice and corn. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from the income of her husband as a carpenter. Gloria has been engaged in her business for over 10 years and earns approximately 8,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Gloria joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Gloria has successfully repaid a previous loan from PMPC. Gloria is requesting a new loan of 6,000 PHP which will be used to purchase fertilizers for the plants. This loan will be the 3rd loan taken out by Gloria from PMPC.

She is 29, married, and the mother of three children, ages 11, 9 and 2.  The two elder children go to school.  Virg\u00ednia only finished fifth grade and did not continue school because of financial difficulties.  She lives in her own house with her family and does not support anyone else.\r\n\r\nShe left Matola to move to Boane District when she married 14 years ago.  She has lived in this District with her family and run her own business since her arrival here.  She has no employees and earns about 2,000 to 3,000 meticais per month, which she uses for household expenses.  With the help of her husband, who works for the Ministry of Health, she saves some money in their bank account.\r\n\r\nVirg\u00ednia has never had loans from other banks.  She learned about Hluvuku through friends who are also customers of this institution.  This is Virg\u00ednia's third loan.  She is asking for 11,500 meticais, which she will use to buy construction materials (cement, iron, sand and oil and other items) to continue construction on her home.  The earlier loans were for 6,000 meticais and 9,000 meticais, both for the same purpose.\r\n\r\nShe promises to pay off this loan on time so she may take out other loans.

Matthew operates a small food shop that he has been running for 10 years.

A 'Mothisha' loan is a product offered by Tujijenge Tanzania that allows borrowers with good credit ratings to pay back their original loans faster and receive extra money before their original loan term would have ended.

She used a few savings she had at home to buy raw materials and started to make jugs and pots.

She earns a minimum of 500 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales each day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue the operation of her business, she is requesting a loan for PHP 8,000. She will be using the loan to buy farm inputs for her business, and for the maintenance of her farm.

She is also a very active community member and won a grant for female entrepreneurs last year. Two years ago she decided it would be profitable to construct two greenhouses in which to grow produce for sale and for her family\u2019s consumption. With the metal frames erected and covered in heavy-duty plastic, her summer crop of tomatoes and winter crop of radishes both flourished and sold well at the local and regional farmers\u2019 markets. Ana and her family use a tractor and a tank trailer to fetch water from the village fountain to irrigate their crops, just one step in a labor-intensive production system. This year, however, the poly-plastic greenhouse covering reached the end of its life expectancy and began to deteriorate. Ana now needs a loan to buy and install new covering over her greenhouse frames and also to make small repairs to the farm\u2019s tractor.

He is married, and has three children aged nine, six and three years. He also takes care of his brother in law who lives together with his family. They reside in Kayole, an informal settlement on the Eastern side of Nairobi. \r\n\r\nJeremiah started his hardware shop in March 2007. Before this, he was employed in a hardware store since 2004, after which he decided to open his own shop. Jeremy (as his friends call him) was not new to business, since he had tried his hand at running his own business immediately after he had completed his high school, back at home in Kisii, in Gucha District. There, he started a small shop at his home where he sold an assortment of fruits and vegetables. However, he felt that he could do more in order to get a higher income, and that is when he decided to come to Nairobi to build his business. While in Nairobi, he lived with his uncle, and he immediately started off another shop selling potato chips (fries) and bananas. Once this business picked, he left it for his wife to run, and it continues to run today. He often helps his wife in the shop in the evenings before closing for the day. \r\n\r\nJeremy now runs a hardware shop that he started off early this year, using some savings amounting to Ksh. 200,000 (USD 3075) that he had put aside from his chips business, together with some of the money he got from his previous employment in the hardware shop. As the business grows, Jeremy has found that he needs to have more stock in his shop, since there is an overwhelming demand from his customers who are mainly carpenters, drawn from the environs of Kayole. Since his operational capital is quite low, he finds that he is not able to buy goods in big bulk, hence he misses out on good discounts. At the same time, he is forced to travel often to the centre of Nairobi City in order to provide what his customers require. \r\n\r\nJeremy is therefore requesting a loan of USD 1175, with which he intends to buy additional stock for his business, including wood, ply wood, paints, veneer, block boards, velvet materials, cushions and nails. He believes that this loan will enable him to have a higher operating capital, and hence enable him to buy more things in bulk.  He will also spend less on transport, and of course will receive better discounts. He intends to repay the loan within a period of 8 months."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1175,"image":{"id":67502,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To purchase hardware materials including: wood, ply wood, veneer, paints etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kayole, Nairobi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-1.283333 36.933333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":36,"posted_date":"2007-09-21T04:30:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1175,"lender_count":40,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jeremiah","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-10-05T16:24:24Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1175,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":1175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":146.88},{"due_date":"2007-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":146.88},{"due_date":"2008-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":146.88},{"due_date":"2008-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":146.88},{"due_date":"2008-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":146.88},{"due_date":"2008-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":146.88},{"due_date":"2008-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":146.88},{"due_date":"2008-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":146.84}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":146.88},{"due_date":"2008-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":146.88},{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":146.88},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":146.88},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":146.88},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":146.88},{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":146.88},{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":146.84}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":147,"local_amount":147,"processed_date":"2007-11-16T10:20:40Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-16T09:27:30Z","rounded_local_amount":147,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":82260},{"amount":147,"local_amount":147,"processed_date":"2007-12-16T10:21:56Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-16T09:27:30Z","rounded_local_amount":147,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97892},{"amount":147,"local_amount":147,"processed_date":"2008-01-16T10:15:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-16T09:27:30Z","rounded_local_amount":147,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":116396},{"amount":147,"local_amount":147,"processed_date":"2008-02-16T10:15:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-16T09:27:30Z","rounded_local_amount":147,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136244},{"amount":147,"local_amount":147,"processed_date":"2008-03-16T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-16T09:27:30Z","rounded_local_amount":147,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":158967},{"amount":147,"local_amount":147,"processed_date":"2008-04-16T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-16T09:27:30Z","rounded_local_amount":147,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":183730},{"amount":147,"local_amount":147,"processed_date":"2008-05-16T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-16T09:27:30Z","rounded_local_amount":147,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211305},{"amount":146,"local_amount":146,"processed_date":"2008-06-16T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-16T09:27:30Z","rounded_local_amount":146,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":239462}],"funded_date":"2007-09-21T16:24:24Z","paid_date":"2008-06-16T09:04:06Z","journal_totals":{"entries":10,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":22885,"name":"Inocencio","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sr. Inocencio A. is 48 years old and lives in Benjam\u00edn Aceval, Paraguay, with his wife, Jorgina Garay, 54.

Since she began working with MCDT, Regina has been able to purchase lorries of charcoal rather than just sacks.  This increase in stock has allowed Regina to garner more profits.

She's a single mother and lives with her son, daughter-in-law, and grandson. For two years she's sold drinks in a space she prepared in her house by arranging a small piece of furniture to serve as a counter. She only takes care of this business on Saturdays and Sundays because she's been working as a secretary in an institution for 27 years. Her son and daughter-in-law are in charge of the business during the week, and she runs it on the weekends. It's very profitable because it's in a good location, and her cold drinks are sold every day. In the future she'd like to expand this business by selling food or distributing beer to other businesses nearby. This is her sixth loan with MFP. Her communal bank is called \"Trabajando juntos\" (Working Together), and she enjoys being part of it because the members are very responsible. She will use the requested loan to purchase more drinks and stock her business in order to increase her sales.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Andrea Rosenberg, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":291212,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Soft Drinks","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Increase her stock of drinks","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-03-22T17:30:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":650,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Aide","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-03-04T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":210.58},{"due_date":"2009-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":227.14},{"due_date":"2009-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":236.23},{"due_date":"2009-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":243.88},{"due_date":"2009-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":253.96},{"due_date":"2009-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":266.71},{"due_date":"2009-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":274.74},{"due_date":"2009-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":286.76}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.44},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.82},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.77},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.26},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.54},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.68},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":89.29},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":93.2}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":68.43,"local_amount":210.58,"processed_date":"2009-04-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:43:05Z","rounded_local_amount":215.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36012262},{"amount":73.82,"local_amount":227.14,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T01:02:25Z","rounded_local_amount":232.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44595844},{"amount":76.77,"local_amount":236.23,"processed_date":"2009-06-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:38:06Z","rounded_local_amount":241.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52990111},{"amount":79.27,"local_amount":243.88,"processed_date":"2009-07-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:39:35Z","rounded_local_amount":249.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63211237},{"amount":82.54,"local_amount":253.96,"processed_date":"2009-08-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:18:57Z","rounded_local_amount":259.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73640747},{"amount":86.68,"local_amount":266.71,"processed_date":"2009-09-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:29:28Z","rounded_local_amount":272.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87080212},{"amount":89.29,"local_amount":274.74,"processed_date":"2009-10-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:01:26Z","rounded_local_amount":280.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96996476},{"amount":93.2,"local_amount":286.76,"processed_date":"2009-11-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:53:30Z","rounded_local_amount":293.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103841984}],"funded_date":"2009-03-22T20:10:30Z","paid_date":"2009-12-15T13:53:30Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Andrea Rosenberg","image":603074}},{"id":100732,"name":"Tororo Road Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. N.

He is 44 years old, married and the father of 4 children who are 14, 12, 9 and 6 years old. All of the children go to school. He only went to school until the 8th grade. He wasn't able to finish school because he was drafted for military service. He lives with his family in his own house and doesn't support anyone else. \r\n\r\nHe left Beira to go to Maputo after completing his military service in 1986. He moved there alone and later established his family. Upon completing his military service he started working for the Ministry of the Interior as a driver. He doesn't have any employees and earns 7.820.00mt per month, which goes towards household expenses. He manages to save some money in his savings account (Barclays Bank). \r\n\r\nHe has requested a loan with Millenium Bim Bank and later decided not to continue to request loans. He came to know Hluvuku through friends who were already partners of the institution.  This loan, in the amount of 25.000.00mt, is his fourth. The previous loans were for 7.700.00mt, 12.000.00mt and 14.000.00mt, all invested towards the same goal. \r\n\r\nOne of his biggest goals is to finish his house in order to provide better living conditions for his family.

Mahigugma-on, Barangay Patic, Pulupandan, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating 2 business ventures:  wholesale shrimp sales and delivery of salt. Her husband, Roderick, 40 years old, works as a fisherman to earn his living and also helps in his wife's business activities. They have 2 children, 9 months and 3 years old. Jelyn joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2007 because she aspired for something better for her family. \r\n\r\nWith the help of her past 4 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Jelyn has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 10,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 5,000, thus uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her 5th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 12,000, which she intends to use to purchase equipment for her delivery business so that she can continue to save up for the future education of her children and the expansion of her business. Jelyn U. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Esteban has been farming for 10 years and considers the most difficult part to be having to work every day because he is left with little time to devote to other activities.
