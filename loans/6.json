Like many others, she needs to generate income through informal employment such as buying goods at wholesale prices from the markets in the country's interior in places such as Oruro,  and reselling them at a profit.   Corina has 3 children who attend school, one of whom will soon finish secondary school.  Right now, they are living in the home of Corina's parents. With the increase in unemployment in the country, Corina's husband had to leave the family to look for work.  While he looked for work in Spain, Corina realized it was her obligation to look for work that could help sustain the family.  In the beginning, her mother allowed her to locate a small shop in her house, but this wasn't sufficient to generate the income needed.   Corina needed to find new opportunities such as her wholesale business.   Corina dreams of being able to increase her income so that she can open her own market.  With the loan, she will purchase merchandise at wholesale prices and then resell it to her customers.

Kalubihan, Brgy. Libertad, Escalante City, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating two business ventures:  a general store and food vending. Her husband Edgardo, who is 44 years old, works as a driver to earn his living and helps in his wife's business activities.  They have six children who are 2 months to 20 years old. Jocelyn joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2005 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 10 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Jocelyn has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 15,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 8,000, uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 11th loan, she is borrowing PHP 15,000, which she intends to use to buy stock for her general store and food vending businesses so that she can continue to pay for her daughter's school tuition. Jocelyn V. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.\n\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She earns her living by operating two business ventures: selling of fruits and a general store businesses. Her husband Antonio P., who is 61 years old, works as a carpenter to earn his living.  They have two children who are 34 and 39 years old. And they have already a job of their own. Cecilia joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2006 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 10 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Cecilia has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 20,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 31,200, uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 11th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 22,000, which she intends to use to pay for more buy stocks of fruits to sell to a market so that she could continue to save up for future family needs. Cecilia is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling daily use products such as shampoo, soap & toothpaste in the local community.

Corazon is requesting a new loan of 23,000 PHP which will be used to purchase new items to expand product offering. This will be the 3rd loan taken out by Corazon from ASKI.

From a young age, she has been known to be very hardworking as well as the caring mother of three children for whom she must provide healthcare, education, and a safe place to live.<p>\r\n\r\nShe started her activities with a small sum received from spousal support, and has been able to bring about an improvement in her financial situation.  Despite this, she still needs to invest in her business and has turned to Ceprodel for loan assistance (39 loans).  These, she tells us, have greatly helped her in the purchase of her products as well as meeting her family's needs.  Her immediate goal is to purchase more vegetables to sell, so she can continue caring for her three children and help them complete their schooling.<p>\r\n\r\n<p><b> Translated from Spanish by Mary Lynn, Kiva Volunteer. <\/b><p> \r\n\r\n<div align='justify'> \r\nMartha del Socorro es una dama que desde hace 15 a\u00f1os se dedica a la venta de verduras en el sector del mercado la Terminal en Le\u00f3n Nicaragua.

This is why their network was split into nineteen sub-groups of five persons each to ensure a better profit outcome. For the second time, they are requesting a loan of 100,000 francs per member, that is 500,000 francs per sub-group, to develop their various businesses.\r\n\r\nHowever, payments are made at the monthly meetings to the group president, assisted by the group treasurer, Ms. Coumba Seck, who are then responsible for reimbursing U-IMCEC.

She aims to generate an average monthly profit of 10,000 FCFA - a proportion of this will be saved for social ends and the rest re-invested in the business.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Danielle Treharne, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":528435,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"For purchasing yams","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Siekourani  ","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2010-04-24T11:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":725,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Anchata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mariam ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maimouna","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Zermene ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Adiaratou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Djienebou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Adiara ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":350000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":87500},{"due_date":"2010-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":87500},{"due_date":"2010-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":87500},{"due_date":"2010-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":87500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":181.25},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":181.25},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":181.25},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":181.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":181.25,"local_amount":87500,"processed_date":"2010-04-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T12:15:41Z","rounded_local_amount":88605.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136746655},{"amount":181.25,"local_amount":87500,"processed_date":"2010-05-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T10:03:40Z","rounded_local_amount":88605.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144779232},{"amount":181.25,"local_amount":87500,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:17:03Z","rounded_local_amount":88605.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151961438},{"amount":181.25,"local_amount":87500,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T12:01:32Z","rounded_local_amount":88605.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159699556}],"funded_date":"2010-04-24T14:28:45Z","paid_date":"2010-08-15T12:01:32Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Danielle Treharne","image":null}},{"id":199181,"name":"Sosan Yaqoobi Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ziba is the daughter of M.

","en":"Karina, age 34, was widowed three years ago.  She lives alone with her two small children in her own house.\r\n\r\nFor six years she has been growing coffee, bananas, corn, and citrus fruits on her own fields.  She also has some rented fields.  She works with the help of workers who keep the fields on her farm cleared.  That way she is able to get her harvest on time.\r\n\r\nShe learned farming techniques thanks to her father\u2019s lessons.  He did not want his daughter dependent upon any man.  What she likes most about her occupation is selling the harvests in the markets in the city where she lives.  She saves the money that she earns.  With effort she bought the possessions that she now has.  As an enterprising woman she plans to later plant a greater quantity of coffee and bananas.\r\n\r\nThis is her first loan with MFP.  Ever since her first meeting she was sure that she liked working with her communal bank.  She likes it because they have given incentives to save.

The region is part of the province of Lambayeque and is located more than an hour and a half from the city of Chiclayo.\r\n\r\nMaria raises and sells small animals. Thanks to this activity she helps her husband pay their family expenses. Now she is raising barn-yard fowl in a space at the back part of her house. When they have reached a good level of development, she offers them for sale to the business people who always visit the area where she lives.\r\n\r\nMaria wants to acquire small birds to increase her business and balanced feed to complete raising them in such a way that she can get more income. For this reason, she has applied for the first time to Edpyme Alternative for a loan of 1000 PEN, which will help her reach her goal.\r\n\r\nMaria is an ambitious and hard-working woman. Her greatest desire is to continue helping her husband so that their children can advance. In the area where she lives, she is known to be a responsible and trustworthy woman.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Pam McMurry, Kiva

family of three people. He has two children. Rahmon is originally from Isfara, a city in the south of Tajikistan. He started his business 15 years ago, after a desperate period of unemployment when his family didn\u2019t get enough for their most basic needs. Today, he offers his services as a woodworker. Rahmon has a perfect credit history. He has already repaid one loan from IMON International without any delinquencies. This time, Rahmon is requesting a loan of $1200 USD to purchase wood products like bold timber, plank timber for his production. We believe this loan will also be repaid promptly. \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

After four years of building her business, she has cultivated successful relationships with several large corporations and expanded her business into nine different states. Her modeling business has also received several minority awards and has become a staple of the Atlanta community. \r\n\r\nRose originally approached ACCION USA when commercial banks were not willing to give her loans and she did not want to see four years of successful small business destroyed. This is Rose\u2019s second loan from ACCION USA. She used her previous loan to help her gain new business, especially after several of her contracts were pulled due to the downturn in the economy. She will use this loan to provide her business with a cushion so she can focus on rebuilding many old contracts and pursuing new and exciting ventures. \r\n\r\nRose is very proud of her business and has worked very hard to achieve the status her agency currently enjoys. She looks forward to growing into the future and continuing to build her reputation as a formidable businesswoman. \r\n\r\nAlso take a look at Rose\u2019s website http:\/\/www.umodelinc.com

She lives with the youngest of her 6 children in her own home.  She started learning agricultural techniques when she was a little girl.  Since that time, she has been growing vegetables; some greens but mainly potatoes and corn which are the products which sell most.  Her work is daily but over the years she has come to realize that the buying and selling of animals is a very profitable business.  This activity complements her income since it takes time for her crops to be ready for harvest.  On weekends she sells her animals at the livestock market and what she doesn't manage to sell she takes home to her stable and uses it for her own consumption.  Over her  working life, she has seen that the sale of animals has less risks and makes more profits.  For this reason, she would like to increase her working capital and put more time and effort into raising animals.\r\n\r\nThis is Elva's 7th loan with MFP.

She is 36 years old, married, and has no children.  She began with a 1000 new sol investment and, fueled by both her husband's and her own entrepreneurial spirit, started a brick manufacturing and sale business since they have a large enough parcel of land and the raw materials, such as clay, needed for the manufacture of bricks.  She is still engaged in the same activity and, thanks to the high quality of her products, she sells to public and private institutions filling orders that number in the thousands of bricks.  In her free time she likes to sell clothing which she offers to her friends and neighbors who have shown a positive response to the wares.  With this new 3000 new sol loan she intends to purchase gallons of fuel and bundles of fire wood which will be used to fire the bricks.  Both her husband and herself share in decision-making with respect to their profits.

He chose to get a permanent job so he could give a good education to his two children, who are 2 and 10 years old. Marvin is 34 years old and he hopes to be able to make a good house for his family that is more secure than their house that is lined with zinc and has a dirt floor. He is happy to have his own house but he wants to make it better. He wants to use this loan to buy construction materials such as stone, sand, cement and iron to begin to build a house of concrete. With the last loan he was able to build a room of wood.

Eufemia has been to this business activity for less than a year and earns approximately 4,000 PHP a month from these activities.\n\nIn 2009, Eufemia joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Eufemia has successfully repaid a previous loan of 4,000 Philippine pesos from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. \n\nEufemia is requesting a new loan of 7,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional inventory and working capital.

They also have small businesses that they run outside of the factories like raising pigs or chickens, selling food or clothing.  The group leader who helped to found the group is Victoria who works in the factory baking bricks.  She lives alone with her 4 children in her own home which she built thanks to her own hard work.  She will use the money from the loan to buy construction materials to finish building her kitchen.  Maria is the bank's treasurer and provides food to the majority of the factory workers.

Merlita is married and has four school-aged children. \r\n\r\nIn 2009, Merlita joined ASKI to gain access to financial services.

This previous loan was used to purchase additional raw materials to expand product offerings. \r\n\r\nMerlita is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase tools and other equipment to expand the business. This loan will be the fifth loan taken out by Merlita from ASKI.

It has 38 branches covering the central and northeastern areas.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Gaining a good market share, he managed to go off on his own and start his own advertising agency venture.  He dedicates himself to creating corporate image campaigns, marketing, publicity campaigns, event planning, typography, graphic design, allocation of office supplies and general sales of publicity materials.  \r\n\r\nHe started this business 4 years ago and his customers include travel agencies, individuals, and other enterprises that recommend his services because they know the quality of the work that Rafael produces.  The financial state of his micro-enterprise goes according to the amount of activity he carries out.  He makes his purchases in cash, and manages a net working margin no smaller than 39.80%.  Meanwhile, his inventories represent 17%, his accounts payable do not exceed 60% and rotate every 13 days; he does inventory every 6 days.\r\n\r\nHis greatest dream and biggest challenge is opening his installation in a more strategic location.  He knows that he will manage this with a great amount of effort when he is better positioned to do so.  Currently, he is applying for his first financing with the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  With his Kiva credit, he will have more access to capital to better carry out his activities and fulfill his orders, while he waits for payment from customers every 30 or 45 days.\r\n\r\nHe will use this loan for creation of posters, publicity materials, and also for a campaign he has been contracted to do along the Caribbean Coast of Colombia, however his working capital is insufficient for this grand undertaking.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1150,"image":{"id":815275,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"create posters and publicity materials, as well as carry out a campaign he has planned throughout the Caribbean Coast of Colombia.

Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Desde muy joven se ha dedicado a labrar la tierra, siembra frutos c\u00edtricos y pl\u00e1tanos, pero no solo se ocupa en su chacra, sino que tambi\u00e9n trabaja para los vecinos que requieran de sus servicios para abrir trochas, dependiendo el tama\u00f1o cobra entre 200 a 300 soles, de acuerdo a los arbustos que est\u00e9n en la tierra, seg\u00fan la dificultad var\u00eda el precio.

He has been living with the mother of his children for roughly 13 years, during which she has been able to build a house in the highlands near his farmland.  He has been working the land since he was very young, sowing citrus fruit and bananas.  In addition to tending his farm, he works for his neighbours who need his services to create trails for which he charges between 200 and 300 soles depending on the size of the trail,  the size of the shrubs to be removed, and the difficulty of the particular job.  At harvest time, he prepares loads of fruit to take to market, usually every two weeks or at month-end.  At other times, he harvests from 4:00 in the morning as he must take his time to prepare the loads correctly and later in the day it is intensely hot and uncomfortable to work in.  When there are buyers in the area he sells in bulk: bananas are sold in 12 kilogram loads.  He makes these preparations in April and May, when the price of bananas is better.  Citrus fruit, however, are at their peak from January to March.  Jos\u00e9 prefers to pay to have his fruit transported to the city and sell it himself because he makes more money this way than by selling to the buyers who come to the farms and pay a lower price.  This is the first loan he is asking for from MFP and he is able to pay on time as he does not want to let down the other members of his community bank who are on their sixth loan, as he is a new member.  He will use the loan to fertilize his farm, and he feels this is enough for now.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Laure Kwon, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":255136,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy fertilizer for his farms.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-01-16T22:30:23Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":175,"lender_count":4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jos\u00e9","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":63},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":63},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":63},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":63},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":63},{"due_date":"2009-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":63},{"due_date":"2009-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":63},{"due_date":"2009-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":59}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":22.05},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":22.05},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":22.05},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.05},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.05},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.05},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.05},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":22.05,"local_amount":63,"processed_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T14:06:12Z","rounded_local_amount":68.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":10228386},{"amount":22.05,"local_amount":63,"processed_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T20:06:05Z","rounded_local_amount":68.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20423621},{"amount":22.05,"local_amount":63,"processed_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:37:18Z","rounded_local_amount":68.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27116889},{"amount":22.04,"local_amount":63,"processed_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:46:56Z","rounded_local_amount":68.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36011811},{"amount":22.05,"local_amount":63,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T00:59:53Z","rounded_local_amount":68.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44595404},{"amount":22.05,"local_amount":63,"processed_date":"2009-06-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:41:24Z","rounded_local_amount":68.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52989645},{"amount":22.06,"local_amount":63,"processed_date":"2009-07-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:43:01Z","rounded_local_amount":68.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63210783},{"amount":20.65,"local_amount":59,"processed_date":"2009-08-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:23:34Z","rounded_local_amount":64.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73640412}],"funded_date":"2009-01-16T22:39:17Z","paid_date":"2009-09-15T19:23:34Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"L K","image":355766}},{"id":87744,"name":"Arusha Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Tausi S., age 60, is married with four children ages 30, 26, 24 and 13.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

With the money that she is now applying for she will buy a greater quantity of clothes to increase her sales and in so doing, her earnings. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Suzanne Grasso, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":388407,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Used Clothing","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"Increase of merchandise","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-09-15T03:40:13Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":700,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Melita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-09-04T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":306.98},{"due_date":"2009-11-02T08:00:00Z","amount":311.54},{"due_date":"2009-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":326.3},{"due_date":"2010-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":337.92},{"due_date":"2010-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":351.89},{"due_date":"2010-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":365.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":107.44},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":109.04},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":114.21},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":118.27},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":123.16},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":127.88}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":107.44,"local_amount":306.98,"processed_date":"2009-10-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T02:59:01Z","rounded_local_amount":313.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96997502},{"amount":109.04,"local_amount":311.54,"processed_date":"2009-11-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:52:58Z","rounded_local_amount":318.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103842849},{"amount":330.69,"local_amount":944.82,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T21:06:17Z","rounded_local_amount":965.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734428},{"amount":24.95,"local_amount":71.29,"processed_date":"2010-02-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:48:38Z","rounded_local_amount":72.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123959608},{"amount":127.88,"local_amount":365.37,"processed_date":"2010-03-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:32:26Z","rounded_local_amount":373.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128992412}],"funded_date":"2009-09-16T04:22:11Z","paid_date":"2010-04-15T09:32:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Suzanne Grasso","image":357930}},{"id":141056,"name":"Mujeres Poderosas 1, 2, 3 Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Maritza is the group coordinator of the Banco D.

For this reason he is asking Edpyme Alternativa for his first, 1,000 sol, loan which will be used to buy nutritionally balanced feed.  His greatest wish is to make improvements to his home which is built with rudimentary materials and to replace the metal sheets, that are used for shade, which are very deteriorated.  He is an exemplary and responsible father.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":427937,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy nutritionally balanced feed for pigs.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"El Morante -

By the grace of God, Lina has managed to support her older child's schooling up to college level. At this time, she is working hard to be able to send her remaining children all the way through college. Lina herself has been a college undergraduate and believes that a college diploma is the best inheritance parents could leave to their children.\r\n\r\nLina operates a variety store where she also does a little direct selling. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a Php5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. Lina gets her supplies at a wholesale price and sells at a smal profit.  Her store is located next to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of Php 200 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php 21,000 loan. She will use the loan to buy more products like groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her inventory. She expects a boost in her income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nLina dreams of giving all her children a good, high-quality education through her hard work. She also hopes to have her house renovated by the end of the year.

Due to her good quality work, she receives regular orders every month. \r\n\r\nShe has applied for a loan from Kiva partner Asasah for her husband who wants to change the body of his auto rickshaw as it has become rough and never makes a good impression on the passengers. \r\n\r\nShahnaz is a very positive-minded person and confident that after changing his rickshaw body, her husband will not only be able to save his business asset but also be able to provide better quality transport services to his passengers and increase his profits. \r\n\r\nNote: In the photo, the lady with a book (called Asasah Passbook) is Shahnaz.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":875,"image":{"id":824974,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Rickshaw","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"To

Preparation of the food obligates this group to remain in their stands for the entire day.  That means working next to their small children, because they don\u2019t make enough money to leave them in daycare centers, an unfortunate situation that leaves the children exposed to many dangers. <p>\r\n\r\nThe \u201cSol Naciente\u201d Association has worked with the Pro-Mujer organization for three years and, with the help of their loan advisor, has proven to be very well organized.

K. named their group Mayamka.  They are local entrepreneurs in the town of Makeni, and this is not their first time receiving a Kiva loan through SMT.  Previous loans have been a great help to the members of this group. It enabled them to expand their businesses, make more profits, and consequently improve the living conditions of the members of the group.  Having repaid their last loan successfully, they have requested a new loan for the amount of Le 1,500,000.\r\n\r\nMariatu is the leader of the group and fifty years of age. She was born in Magbass, a few miles away from Magburaka in the Tonkolili District in northern Sierra Leone. She is married to a diamond digger, and they have three children. One of their children is now running a business, one is in secondary school and the youngest is in primary school. Mariatu sells groundnuts and sometimes items such as onions, rice, and palm oil depending on market demand. She has been in business for more than thirty years now.\r\n\r\nWith this new loan, Mariatu will expand her business by buying more bags of groundnuts.  She will be able to get at least eight bags of groundnuts depending on the price determined by the market.  She travels to Bamoi (a make-shift business center) to buy the groundnuts.  In Bamoi, a bag of groundnuts costs something between Le 80,000 and 110,000.  She pays a fare of Le 15,000 or 20,000 for transport to and from Bamoi and another Le 2,000 as a delivery charge for each bag of groundnuts she brings back with her.\r\n\r\nEvery time she receives a loan from SMT, Mariatu experiences growth in her business. This time again, she is expecting an increase in profit, which will improve her standard of living. She will be able to assist her children in school, feed them and give them medical attention whenever they are sick."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":238989,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":["Conflict Zones"],"use":"Bags of groundnuts","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SL","country":"Sierra Leone","town":"Makeni","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"8.883333 -12.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":57,"posted_date":"2008-12-16T05:20:48Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":450,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mariatu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Adama","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-12-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"SLL","disbursal_amount":1300000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":162500},{"due_date":"2009-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":162500},{"due_date":"2009-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":162500},{"due_date":"2009-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":162500},{"due_date":"2009-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":162500},{"due_date":"2009-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":162500},{"due_date":"2009-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":162500},{"due_date":"2009-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":162500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":77.88,"local_amount":225000,"processed_date":"2009-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-19T09:07:28Z","rounded_local_amount":233887.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14885071},{"amount":90.87,"local_amount":262500,"processed_date":"2009-03-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:43:55Z","rounded_local_amount":272868.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27128913},{"amount":56.24,"local_amount":162500,"processed_date":"2009-04-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:10:09Z","rounded_local_amount":168918.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36025702},{"amount":225.01,"local_amount":650000,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T07:55:48Z","rounded_local_amount":675675,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53008506}],"funded_date":"2008-12-17T04:03:22Z","paid_date":"2009-07-16T07:55:48Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tamara Sanderson","image":167019}},{"id":83664,"name":"Roberto","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El se\u00f1or Roberto vive en casa de sus padres con su esposa e hijo en la calle Illampu de la zona Rosario de la ciudad de La Paz, trabaja como chofer realizando viajes a Oruro en transporte libre; con estos ingresos \u00e9l mantiene a su familia.\n\nEl cr\u00e9dito que solicita es para instalar un sitio de servicio de Internet en la casa de sus suegros lugar donde su esposa podr\u00e1 atender y de esta  manera aumentar sus ingresos.\n\nNo tiene Historial por que es cliente nuevo pero por el car\u00e1cter social califica para obtener un cr\u00e9dito.\n","en":"Mr. Robert lives in his parents' house with his wife and son on Illampu street in the Rosario zone in the city of La Paz.

Es una hija muy amorosa, se preocupa mucho por el bienestar de sus padres, la escasez de dinero que hay en su hogar, le impidi\u00f3 terminar sus estudios superiores, por lo cual tuvo que encontrar la forma de llevar dinero a su casa, actualmente se dedica a la venta de helados, los cuales son muy solicitados por sus clientes, ya que los prepara muy deliciosos. A Luz le gusta mucho vender sus helados en los d\u00edas soleados, ya que siente que la gente se refresca gracias a ella, anhela tener una helader\u00eda muy grande donde pueda atender mejor a sus clientes y vender con mayor comodidad. Lleva 3 a\u00f1os en este negocio y lo que menos le gusta es el fri\u00f3 que siente al hacer los helados, pero igual Luz persiste en su af\u00e1n de alcanzar sus metas y no le importa los sacrificios que tenga que hacer. Es su segundo pr\u00e9stamo con MFP y se siente en la obligaci\u00f3n de pagarlo a tiempo, ya que no desea causarle problemas a su banco comunal donde es muy querida, y como todav\u00eda es muy joven, siempre es aconsejada por el resto de las socias. El dinero solicitado lo invertir\u00e1 en comprar una m\u00e1quina para almacenar sus helados, lo cual le costar\u00e1 alrededor de tres mil nuevos soles, ella est\u00e1 dispuesta a poner el resto de dinero de sus ahorros, con tal de mejorar su negocio.","en":"Luz, 19, is a single young woman who lives with her parents who she loves very much.  She would like to help with the family's expenses and give her parents a dignified retirement.  She's a loving daughter, concerned about the well-being of her parents.  The lack of money in the household prevented her from finishing her university studies.  She had to find another way to bring money into the household so she started a business selling ice cream, something much in demand from her customers because the ice cream that she makes is delicious.  Luz especially likes selling ice cream to her customers on sunny days because she believes they're reinvigorated thanks to her.  She dreams of having a large ice cream shop where she would be better able to tend to her customers.  She's operated the business for 3 years.  The thing she likes least about the business is feeling cold when she makes the ice cream but, even so, she continues to strive toward her goals without caring about the sacrifices that she might have to make.  This is her second MFP loan and she strongly feels an obligation to repay the loan on time because she doesn't want to cause problems at her communty bank, where she is much loved, and, because of her youth, much advised by the other members.  The loan will be used to buy a machine for storing ice cream, something that will cost around three thousand new soles.  She will use her savings to pay for the balance.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jere Wiseman, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":289741,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Buy a device for storing ice cream.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Puno","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15.833333 -70.033333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-03-20T18:10:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Luz","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-02-17T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1300,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":217},{"due_date":"2009-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":217},{"due_date":"2009-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":217},{"due_date":"2009-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":217},{"due_date":"2009-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":217},{"due_date":"2009-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":215}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":70.94},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.94},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.94},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.94},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.94},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.3}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":70.94,"local_amount":217,"processed_date":"2009-03-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:38:50Z","rounded_local_amount":225.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27117270},{"amount":70.94,"local_amount":217,"processed_date":"2009-04-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:49:06Z","rounded_local_amount":225.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36012193},{"amount":70.94,"local_amount":217,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T01:01:49Z","rounded_local_amount":225.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44595774},{"amount":70.94,"local_amount":217,"processed_date":"2009-06-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:41:52Z","rounded_local_amount":225.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52990041},{"amount":70.94,"local_amount":217,"processed_date":"2009-07-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:43:29Z","rounded_local_amount":225.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63211174},{"amount":70.3,"local_amount":215,"processed_date":"2009-08-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:23:53Z","rounded_local_amount":223.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73640684}],"funded_date":"2009-03-20T19:23:57Z","paid_date":"2009-09-15T19:23:53Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jere Wiseman","image":30736}},{"id":100048,"name":"Djekafo (Parlons La M\u00eame Voix) Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Djekafo est un regroupement de femmes du   village de T\u00e9n\u00e9 (r\u00e9gion de S\u00e9gou) qui se sont regroup\u00e9 pour la pratique de la m\u00eame activit\u00e9.

The women average 25 years of age, are all married, and are the mothers of at least four children.  Their businesses involve buying and selling condiments (onions, tomatoes, oil, Maggi bouillon cubes, spices, etc.)  The group members joined the loan program of the micro-finance institution Soro Yiriwaso a year ago in order to stop running short of inventory.  Loan amounts have gone from 50,000 francs CFA for the first loan to 75,000 francs for the second.  And the first loan has been correctly repaid.\r\n<p>\r\nThe current loan will be used to buy condiments of all sorts, in bulk from producers and wholesale merchants.  The condiments are sold from tables along the main asphalt road, where commerce conducted.\r\n<p>\r\nWith this new loan, the group members each plan to realize an average profit of 80,000 francs in the course of the cycle.  In addition to making loan payments, a portion of their profits will be used to address typical family expenses.  In the days to come, they plan to obtain larger loans, so as to increase the quantity of merchandise and to diversify with commerce in fruits.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":299718,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"To buy condiments ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Koutiala","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2009-05-01T07:00:37Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":625,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Foun\u00e9 ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nema ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Korotoumou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Korotoumou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-03-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":300000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.17},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.17},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.17},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.17},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.17},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":208.33,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-05-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:41:51Z","rounded_local_amount":102433.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44621189},{"amount":104.17,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-06-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:23:54Z","rounded_local_amount":51216.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53020149},{"amount":104.18,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-07-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T19:21:38Z","rounded_local_amount":51216.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63242904},{"amount":104.17,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-08-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T22:44:42Z","rounded_local_amount":51216.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73678595},{"amount":104.15,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-09-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T03:57:48Z","rounded_local_amount":51216.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87112527}],"funded_date":"2009-05-10T21:18:03Z","paid_date":"2009-10-16T03:57:48Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Daniel Kuey","image":669418}},{"id":104144,"name":"Paea","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Paea L., 62, is married and the mother of eight children.

For three years, she has maD. delicious frozen fruit juices which many in her neighborhood pick up for breakfast.  Her flavors incluD. cantaloupe, passion fruit, cherry and pineapple.  Along with these treats, Maria makes fresh bread to augment her sales.\r\n<p>\r\nMaria lives with her husband and one of her three children who is currently working at a local resort.  While her son is now in his late 20s, he wants to return to school sometime soon.  With only nine months of the Dominican equivalent of high school left, it is very possible that he can complete his high school, and then consider moving on to a more advanced degree.\r\n<p>\r\nIn the future, Maria also hopes to apply any extra income to improving her home and to expanding the selection of goods she can afford to make and sell.  She would love to begin selling more treats, such as cookies and other baked goods which would complement her frozen juice.  She hopes, if her business takes off, to make her home out of cement blocks, rather than just wood.  A home maD. of these blocks is extremely important to many Dominicans, as it withstands rain and does not rot away.\r\n<p>\r\nEsperanza International encourage you to give to Maria and the others in her group.  All are committed to stewarding their loan wisely and have dreams and wishes to improve their living situation and that of their families.\r\n<p>\r\nMuchas

Hurmatoy is a happy mother of three children. She is 29 years old and married. Hurmatoy is a teacher. Her salary is very small and that\u2019s why she has been running her own grocery business.

She works with one aim in mind, to provide the best possible example and way of life for her beloved children who are all the apple of her eye and the reason for her daily efforts. <P>\r\n\r\nWith this opportunity and with the immense love Hurmatoy feels as a mother and her desire to succeed, she is appealing to your generosity and is requesting a loan of 6800 Somoni in order to increase the range of her goods. You can be an important link in the growth of this business by supporting Hurmatoy. <P>\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International<P>\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.<P>\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

To achieve this, she separated a part of the living room and made it into a dining hall. This is where she serves food to her demanding clients every day starting at noon. She sells each dish for 5 sols during work days and for 7 sols during the weekend. \r\n\r\nQueta prepares her dishes with the very best ingredients she can find since she is always committed to the satisfaction of her guests; she really likes to cook and to see the enjoyment her customers get from her dishes. Queta is very selective when purchasing ingredients, and, because of this, she does not like to buy them each day, but instead buys enough to last the whole week, except for the vegetables.\r\n\r\nWhile Queta manages her restaurant, her husband works as a teacher; he also helps out with the restaurant. Being an entrepreneurial woman, Queta has future plans to expand her business with dessert products. \r\n\r\nThis is Queta's eighth loan with MFP, and she is very enthusiastic about continuing to work as a member of her communal bank, where she is the president of the management committee. She plans to use the loan to renovate the front side of her house in order to make the entrance to her restaurant look more appealing; the remaining amount will be used to purchase raw ingredients for the preparation of her dishes.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Andrei Vazhnov, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":553465,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Restaurant","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Renovations, purchase of ingredients for food preparation","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-06-16T12:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Queta ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-06-03T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2010-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":165}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.63},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.62},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.63},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.62},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.63},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":61.87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":62.63,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:37:15Z","rounded_local_amount":177.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159673426},{"amount":62.62,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:39:34Z","rounded_local_amount":177.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166887249},{"amount":62.63,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:25:55Z","rounded_local_amount":177.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172154258},{"amount":62.63,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T15:14:42Z","rounded_local_amount":177.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177449566},{"amount":124.49,"local_amount":332,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:00:34Z","rounded_local_amount":353.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182588254}],"funded_date":"2010-06-16T14:30:44Z","paid_date":"2010-12-15T15:00:34Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Andrei Vazhnov","image":null}},{"id":211518,"name":"Hatun Finca Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El Banco Comunal Hat\u00fan Finca inicia su primer ciclo con 17 socias, muchas D. ellas son vecinas.\nAlejandrina es L. presidenta D. su Banco Comunal, Alejandrina es conviviente y tiene una ni\u00f1a D. 6 a\u00f1os que estudia en el primer grado D. primaria, lo que mas le gusto D.

Cherry joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2005 because she hoped for something better for her family. With the help of her past 8 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Cherry has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow.

Cherry S. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.\t\r\n\r\n<p>About NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).
