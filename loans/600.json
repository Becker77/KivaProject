De peque\u00f1a realizaba las labores agr\u00edcolas y el cuidado de las vacas, ahora con su propia familia, siembra mayormente espinaca; pero le es m\u00e1s rentable comprar por chacras porque al comprar se puede calcular por un aproximado de 40 canastas, pero al cosechar saca entre 60 o 70 canastas, esto le permite pagar peones y transporte de los productos, as\u00ed gana un 50 % m\u00e1s de lo invertido.

El dinero  que ha solicitado es para la compra de grandes cantidades de avena para alimentar a sus vacas y que no deje de faltarles la leche, y de ese modo cubran sus gastos familiares. ","en":"Rosmery is 27 years old, has lived with her husband for 9 years and has a son.  At night she sleeps at her home, but prepares food in her mother\u2019s home.  Since she was young she has worked in farming and raising cattle.  Now that she has her own family, she mostly grows spinach.  Spinach is profitable because when you purchase a field and calculate that it will yield about 40 baskets of spinach, it will actually yield between 60-70 baskets during the harvest.  The extra crop allows her to pay workers and to transport her products, and she earns 50% more than she invests.  At the same time, she also works with her mother delivering milk.  For the past 27 years her mother has delivered milk to restaurants and bakeries.  Now Rosmery and her mother alternate weeks\u2014one week Rosmery delivers milk and the next her mother delivers it.  Rosmery is very content with what she does and has plans to increase her spinach crops.  She will also increase her oat crop in order to feed her cows.  Rosmery is an entrepreneurial  member [of the community bank] and very punctual at their programmed meetings.  This is her twelfth loan and she has always been on-time with her payments.  The money she is asking for will be used to buy large quantities of oats to feed to her cows so they will continue producing milk and she can pay for her household expenses.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Rachel Crouch, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":272009,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Buy oats to feed to cattle","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-02-17T22:10:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":625,"lender_count":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosmery","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-02-04T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":333},{"due_date":"2009-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":333},{"due_date":"2009-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":333},{"due_date":"2009-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":333},{"due_date":"2009-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":333},{"due_date":"2009-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":335}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":104.06},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.06},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.06},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.06},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.06},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.7}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":104.06,"local_amount":333,"processed_date":"2009-03-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:33:38Z","rounded_local_amount":338.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27117073},{"amount":104.06,"local_amount":333,"processed_date":"2009-04-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:42:02Z","rounded_local_amount":338.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36011986},{"amount":104.06,"local_amount":333,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T01:01:25Z","rounded_local_amount":338.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44595571},{"amount":104.06,"local_amount":333,"processed_date":"2009-06-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:37:35Z","rounded_local_amount":338.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52989833},{"amount":104.06,"local_amount":333,"processed_date":"2009-07-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:39:06Z","rounded_local_amount":338.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63210969},{"amount":104.7,"local_amount":335,"processed_date":"2009-08-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:17:48Z","rounded_local_amount":340.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73640472}],"funded_date":"2009-02-18T00:02:50Z","paid_date":"2009-09-15T19:17:48Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Rachel Crouch","image":59003}},{"id":93336,"name":"Milka","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Milka A. is a 40-year-old mother of 5 children, aged 20, 19, 17, 14, and 8.

His dream is to have a country with greater opportunities for people who want to work. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":342380,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Spare Parts","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"for the purchase of batteries","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PY","country":"Paraguay","town":"Caaguaz\u00fa","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-22.993333 -57.996389","type":"point"}},"partner_id":58,"posted_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:26Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":600,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Yomny ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-05-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PYG","disbursal_amount":3000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":272727.27},{"due_date":"2009-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":272727.27},{"due_date":"2009-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":272727.27},{"due_date":"2009-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":272727.27},{"due_date":"2009-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":272727.27},{"due_date":"2009-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":272727.27},{"due_date":"2010-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":272727.27},{"due_date":"2010-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":272727.27},{"due_date":"2010-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":272727.27},{"due_date":"2010-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":272727.27},{"due_date":"2010-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":272727.3}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.55},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.55},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.55},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.55},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.55},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.55},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.55},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.55},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.55},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.55},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":54.55,"local_amount":272727.27,"processed_date":"2009-07-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T14:15:22Z","rounded_local_amount":274363.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63177534},{"amount":54.55,"local_amount":272727.27,"processed_date":"2009-08-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T15:47:08Z","rounded_local_amount":274363.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73602915},{"amount":54.55,"local_amount":272727.27,"processed_date":"2009-09-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T18:29:35Z","rounded_local_amount":274363.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87038990},{"amount":54.55,"local_amount":272727.27,"processed_date":"2009-10-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T22:00:11Z","rounded_local_amount":274363.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96951424},{"amount":54.55,"local_amount":272727.27,"processed_date":"2009-11-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T12:38:45Z","rounded_local_amount":274363.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103793522},{"amount":54.55,"local_amount":272727.27,"processed_date":"2009-12-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T13:45:55Z","rounded_local_amount":274363.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110684291},{"amount":54.55,"local_amount":272727.27,"processed_date":"2010-01-09T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-17T09:31:04Z","rounded_local_amount":274363.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118078902},{"amount":54.55,"local_amount":272727.27,"processed_date":"2010-02-08T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:11:16Z","rounded_local_amount":274363.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123915079},{"amount":54.55,"local_amount":272727.27,"processed_date":"2010-03-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:02:50Z","rounded_local_amount":274363.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128950794},{"amount":54.55,"local_amount":272727.27,"processed_date":"2010-04-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:43:32Z","rounded_local_amount":274363.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136679626},{"amount":54.5,"local_amount":272727.3,"processed_date":"2010-05-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:20:29Z","rounded_local_amount":274363.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144714025}],"funded_date":"2009-07-18T03:13:15Z","paid_date":"2010-06-15T09:20:29Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sheila McCormick","image":null}},{"id":122008,"name":"Firdavs","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"I.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

However, most of the financial and emotional investments she had then vanished when her husband died just recently. She spend thousands of money for her husband's medication before the death and even until the burial. Having her only 11-year-old child beside her, Edna realized she has to be strong to restart running her general store business for her child's education and future.\n\nFrom a Php12,000 previously, Edna chose to lessen the amount she will loan now despite her qualification for loaning large amount because she will start all over again and for the first time, without her husband's support. In the near future she believes that she will be able to grow her business again with loans she will be getting from ASHI.

S. (0) is a 29-year-old woman living in the town of Savalalo.  She is married and has 1 infant-aged child.  To make a living, Korina is starting a business venture in the food sector making & selling food.  While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling baked goods in the local community.  Korina has just started operating this business and earns approximately 300 WST a month from these activities.\n\nIn 2009, Korina joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve  her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Korina is requesting for the first time a loan from SPBD.    Korina is now requesting a new loan of 1000 WST which will be used to purchase raw ingredients needed to make products for sale.  The loan will be the 1st loan taken out by the borrower from SPBD.  Korina plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business  to improve\/expand the borrower's business.\n\nAbout SPBD:\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.\n\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\"\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":382303,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

Maynard is requesting a new loan of 10000 PHP which will be used to purchase baby livestock to raise & sell in the future. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Maynard from GDMPC. He plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement the family's income. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three units offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":572114,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase baby livestock to raise & sell in the future","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Baliangao Misamis Occidental","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":136,"posted_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:18Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":225,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maynard","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-07-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2010-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2010-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2010-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2010-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2011-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":1666.67,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:22:05Z","rounded_local_amount":1742.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166855154},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":1666.67,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:11:47Z","rounded_local_amount":1742.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172121865},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":1666.67,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T14:29:15Z","rounded_local_amount":1742.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177415962},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":1666.67,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T14:17:26Z","rounded_local_amount":1742.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182555497},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":1666.67,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T13:18:25Z","rounded_local_amount":1742.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188692217},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":1666.65,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T03:46:13Z","rounded_local_amount":1742.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191431468}],"funded_date":"2010-08-05T01:07:48Z","paid_date":"2011-02-16T03:46:13Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Misty McNally","image":77472}},{"id":221192,"name":"Sadiatou","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"il y a plus de 10 ans que cette femme s'est sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9e dans le commerce de tissus et de bazins, elle ma\u00eetrise parfaitement ce march\u00e9. elle fait ce commerce de fa\u00e7on ambulante pour toucher plus de clients; elle s'approvisionne au burkina faso, un pays voisin  et \u00e0 lom\u00e9. le stock actuel de marchandises ne lui permet pas de subvenir aux besoins de ses clients. elle sollicite de WAGES un cr\u00e9dit pour l'achat de divers tissus et divers bazins de diff\u00e9rentes qualit\u00e9s. elle est mari\u00e9e et m\u00e8re de 5 enfants","en":"For over ten years, Mrs. K.

He is still quite young, but he has proven to be a successful entrepreneur with his computer and games shop. He has owned and run this shop for more than three years. With his loan request of $800 from Kiva partner Ameen s.a.l., he will improve his business and purchase new computers at good prices and he needs this amount to add to his saving to buy them. Those computers will allow him to significantly increase his productivity and also his income. He is positive about his business prospects and plans to further expand. He is hoping to open a new branch of his shop in the coming year. \r\n\r\nNote: Based on the political and social challenges of Lebanon, personally identifiable attributes of this entrepreneur have been altered to protect him (i.e., blacking out portions of the entrepreneur in his picture, not indicating his name and location, etc.) Ameen s.a.l. appreciates Kiva lenders' understanding of these challenges and encourages them to continue their support for Lebanon's borrowers.\r\n\r\nAbout Ameen: Ameen s.a.l. has been a major player in the Lebanese microfinance sector since 1999. Originally a micro-credit program created by CHF International, Ameen evolved to become Ameen s.a.l. in 2003, a Lebanese services company. In 2007, Ameen s.a.l. registered with the Central Bank of Lebanon to become the first Lebanese financial institution specialized in microfinance.\r\n\r\nAt Ameen s.a.l., we pledge to provide financial services to the largest number of micro and small entrepreneurs and to the working poor, to help them develop their businesses and improve their incomes.\r\n\r\nAmeen has been able to use its interest-free loans from Kiva to offer lower-interest loans with faster disbursement for their micro-loan borrowers. Since its inception, Ameen has provided high-quality financial services to over 41,000 borrowers and disbursed over 81,000 loans totaling $115 million.

She started selling jewelry, handbags and cosmetics that she bought and restyled from her home. Marcel was able to sell items even cheaper than available at the souk market.\r\n\r\nMarcel needed this loan to renovate her workstation and purchase additional stock.  She dreams of continuing to branch out into additional items and utilizing her sewing and artistic skills.

In time, she gained customers and a good reputation for her work. Talat\u2019s children are all studying at school and the next year two of her sons are planning to enter university and need tuition.

The loan will be her 2nd from SPBD. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>About SPBD:<\/b>\r\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.

Moreover, he also has a tractor which helps him generate additional income in spring when he plows fields for other farmers in his region. Alexei has been growing vegetables for three years.

Products can range from furniture to household appliances, electronic devices, clothing, and other items. Customers are attracted to buy due to the low selling prices and the many options they are offered. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of PHP 200 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue the operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 12,000 loan. She will use the loan to buy more quantities and varieties of products to expand her product inventory.

She has been struggling to raise these children with the help of her husband. She faces difficulties providing for their school needs, especially payment of their school fees on time. She has successfully borrowed and repaid loans seven times with GHAPE since 2002. She plans to invest this loan in a provision store which will contain rice, beans, palm oil, groundnut oil, savon, magi, salt, and the sale of firewood. She has been in this for a long time now, and success is her watch word. She believes the business will succeed because she has targeted a period where there will be scarcity of firewood and at that time it will be expensive. The loan will help her community because they will be able to buy firewood and other items in her provision store at affordable prices.\r\n\r\nP. will plough back her profit into her business and use part to care for her family. Her children\u2019s school needs will be taken care of.

GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach.  Every client is trained in business management, basic health, life skills, financial management, profits and losses, and family values.  Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement.  GHAPE instils a sense of family and community within its clients and staff and has developed a strong bond of trust between the organization and its clients."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1175,"image":{"id":723944,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To buy palm oil, groundnut oil, rice, savon, firewood.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CM","country":"Cameroon","town":"Foncha St, Nkwen, NW.

Marivic was a high school graduate. At present, she is a wife to Jose, a construction worker, and a loving mother to four children. Two of her children are already working, while two are studying in high school. Their family resides in Pasay City. Aside from her family and business, Marivic also spends time attending weekly Bible fellowship* meeting where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\nIn order to make a living, Marivic sells frozen food from house to house in their community in Pasay. She sees this as an effective strategy since it also gives her a way to build relationships with her customers on a more intimate level. She has been doing this by herself for six years now, and earns a monthly net income of Php 9,000.\r\n\r\nTo help continue the operation of her business, Marivic is requesting a loan for Php13,000 to help her increase her sales. She will use this to add more to her stocks of processed meat such as hotdogs and sweet ham, as well as pork and chicken meat. She admits that the loan will definitely boost her capital and will serve as a step toward business growth. According to her, part of the profits will be used to finance the schooling of her children, so the loan benefits not only the business but also her family.\r\n\r\nOne struggle Marivic faces is delayed payments by her customers. Some do not pay in full and leave part of it to debt. Marivic frequently worries about the education of her children, but she fights these struggles and makes sure at the end of the day that she is happy inside out, because a happy family starts with her, the light of their home.  She desires to see her business grow and presently looks for other sources of income. She also prays that her husband and children would have stable jobs and that her two younger children will finish their schooling.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance loans.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":779633,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

This is 56 year old Monica M. M. from Mbeya. She is a widow with 8 children, between the ages of 18 and 40. Additionally, she is responsible for supporting two dependents because their parents cannot care for them.  Monica has been running a bar since 2000. Her bar is a good place to relax with a beer if you manage to finish work early on a Friday afternoon. You can relax on a plastic chair under a tree, with a local beer in hand, the aroma of roasting \u2018mishikaki\u2019  (kebabs made on an open fire) wafting around you, and talk to everyone who happens to wander by.  Monika works at the business for 9 - 12 hours per day, 7 days per week and is assisted by two employees. Monica currently earns about 230USD a month from her business. She is requesting a loan of 300USD in order to purchase more drinks in bulk. In the future, she plans to increase the range of her business. Monica thanks you for your support!\r\n\r\nABOUT SELFINA:\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":303452,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pub","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To purchase more drinks in bulk.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbeya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.9 33.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-04-14T20:30:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Monica M.

At the end of several loan cycles, these savings are returned to Giannina and the other communal bank clients, providing each of them with an additional source of capital to use to improve their business and quality of life.  \r\n<p>\r\nGiannina\u2019s business is buying and selling clothes, which she has been doing for the past 6 years.  She buys her inventory in Lima, Arequipa and Cusco, and then sells the clothes in one of the main markets in Cusco.  Giannina wants a loan to buy new lines of clothing to sell in her market stand and thereby grow her business.\r\n<p>\r\nGiannina appreciates Kiva lenders and thanks you for the loan. She promises to pay the monthly payments on time.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":451232,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"Buy clothing to sell in market","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"CUSCO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.518333 -71.978056","type":"point"}},"partner_id":119,"posted_date":"2009-12-18T16:40:18Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":175,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Giannina Mariela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-12-11T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":117.75},{"due_date":"2010-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":122.46},{"due_date":"2010-03-11T08:00:00Z","amount":127.36},{"due_date":"2010-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":132.43}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.21},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.86},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.58},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.35}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":41.21,"local_amount":117.75,"processed_date":"2010-01-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T10:42:28Z","rounded_local_amount":118.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118034400},{"amount":42.94,"local_amount":122.69,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T09:05:09Z","rounded_local_amount":123.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123872496},{"amount":44.62,"local_amount":127.48,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T08:19:42Z","rounded_local_amount":128.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128905755},{"amount":46.23,"local_amount":132.08,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T09:49:00Z","rounded_local_amount":132.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136633228}],"funded_date":"2009-12-18T18:41:05Z","paid_date":"2010-05-15T09:49:00Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Susan Olson","image":null}},{"id":167387,"name":"Lina Amely","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Lina es socia del Banco Comunal Amor Divino.\nLina es soltera, tiene 27 a\u00f1os y 1 hijo, Lina vende materiales de construcci\u00f3n, cuenta con un local para almac\u00e9n y sus ventas los realiza a domicilio, actividad que realiza con la ayuda de su pap\u00e1.\nLina necesita un pr\u00e9stamo de 1750 soles dinero que ser\u00e1 invertido en la compra de arena.\nLina sue\u00f1a con aperturar una ferreter\u00eda y tener una tienda de ropa.\n\n","en":"Lina is a member of the Amor Divino communal bank.\r\nLina is 27 years old, single, and has a son.

She lives in her own home and what she most desires is to improve her quality of life.\r\n\r\nSince she was a little girl, Mar\u00eda has been taught to work hard at everything in order to achieve her goals.  Her business is selling alfalfa and guinea pigs that she grows and raises herself.  In parallel with this, she also works together with her sister making cheese and 'manjar' (a sweetened condensed milk product).  They sell these products in the city of Lima.\r\n\r\nWhat Maria most likes about her work is raising her guinea pigs and she does this with a lot of love.  She has been in this business for 16 years and she considers that the most difficult part of her work is having to constantly travel to Lima with her 'manjar' and cheese orders.  Over time, Mar\u00eda hopes that her business will continue to grow and that it will make her better profits.\r\n\r\nThis is Mar\u00eda's 12th loan with MFP and she is ready to make all her repayments on time since she doesn't want to make difficulties for her community bank.  Mar\u00eda is very supportive of the other members of her bank.  She will use the 2,800 Peruvian soles she is requesting to buy more feed for her guinea pigs since this is the business that is making her the best profits."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1025,"image":{"id":714840,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy alfalfa and other feed for her guinea pigs","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-02-18T14:10:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1025,"lender_count":31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-02-08T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2800,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":422.17},{"due_date":"2011-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":439.05},{"due_date":"2011-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":456.62},{"due_date":"2011-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":474.88},{"due_date":"2011-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":493.88},{"due_date":"2011-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":513.4}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":154.54},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":160.73},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":167.15},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":173.84},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":180.8},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":187.94}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":154.54,"local_amount":422.17,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:38:10Z","rounded_local_amount":427.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201327734},{"amount":160.73,"local_amount":439.05,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:33:08Z","rounded_local_amount":444.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206196259},{"amount":167.15,"local_amount":456.62,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:42:34Z","rounded_local_amount":462.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211269938},{"amount":173.84,"local_amount":474.88,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:32:21Z","rounded_local_amount":480.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216549953},{"amount":179.47,"local_amount":490.27,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T09:12:42Z","rounded_local_amount":496.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221718632},{"amount":189.27,"local_amount":517.01,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-17T08:13:34Z","rounded_local_amount":523.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227350056}],"funded_date":"2011-02-18T20:42:30Z","paid_date":"2011-09-17T08:13:34Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Oxnard","image":null}},{"id":278593,"name":"Nelson Jose","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Desempe\u00f1\u00e1ndose como Maestro de Primaria desde el a\u00f1o 1,985  es soltero viaja de le\u00f3n a su centro de trabajo diario, este se\u00f1or ha obtenido 2 financiamientos con la empresa bajo el convenio firmado con dicho colegio, ya que los financiamientos les han ayudado a mejorar su situaci\u00f3n y nivel de vida, ya que la necesidad actual es un tratamiento M\u00e9dico y Mejoramiento de la vivienda antes que entre el invierno.","en":"He has been working as an elementary school teacher since 1985.

","en":"Margarita lives in Atlacahualoya, in the State of Morelos, Mexico.  She is 70 years old, married, and has six children who are all married.\r\n\r\nMargarita owns a grocery store.  She requested this loan to buy soft drinks, Sabrita-brand snacks, soap, bleach, salt, matches, cookies, toilet paper, eggs and sugar with which to stock her store.  She started her business two years ago with some savings which she added to some money her children gave her.  Her son-in-law lent her some shelves to display her merchandise and she bought a refrigerator to keep her soft drinks cold.\r\n\r\nMargarita used to make casserole dishes, pots and pitchers from clay when she lived in San Marcos.  However, she moved because her husband and children came to work on the land in Atlacahualoya.  Margarita's business is important because, although it isn't much, she is prepared for any unforeseen circumstances as she has work.  She also feels happy serving her customers who are her neighbors, visitors and tourists.  She uses her profits to re-stock her store.\r\n\r\nMargarita is planning to grow corn and onions during this rainy season since her husband enjoys working on the land and she likes it when there are ears of corn that she can grill and eat.  Her dreams and hopes are for her family to be well and live happily.\r\n\r\nAtlacahualoya is a beautiful village with land where people work growing onions and corn.  There are market gardens full of green 'guajes' (a type of squash).  Margarita would like to say to Kiva and Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad \"Thank you for the loan.

University and has completed her apprenticeship and two years further work. She now wishes to set up an independent practice in Sur Baher in south Jerusalem, not far from her home in Sharfat, where she lives with her husband, an electrical engineer. There are currently two dental practices in Sur Baher but neither employs any female dentist. As the community in this area is traditional, it is likely that many women would prefer to be treated by a female dentist. She also has been commended for her gentle touch, which is important especially with small children; so she has acquired much experience working with young patients. Therefore, she intends to specialise in the treatment of young children. Finally, she recognises a need in the community to provide dental services at home for elderly housebound patients. She has received business training from MATI (a local training organisation). So, she now plans to acquire the equipment to set up her dental practice. She has negotiated a deal with an organisation that specialises in providing such equipment \u2013 the overall cost would be NIS 64,000 but she needs a downpayment of NIS 27,000.

She learned how to do this very early on from her mom (like most women of her ethnic group:  the Minianka).  She has been doing this work in her home for fifteen years.  To obtain the supplementary financial resources, she decided to turn to the micro-finance institution Soro Yiriwaso, with which she is on her first individual loan.\r\n<p>She gets her basic supplies in the villages surrounding Koutiala on market days.  With this loan, she intends to buy 30 sacks of n\u00e9r\u00e9 seeds of different grades that she will have taken to Koutiala.  These seeds are pounded, boiled, and crushed and then transformed into rounded forms or into a powder.  Next, these Sounbala are put into a container for sale in bulk in Koutiala with enterprises at the marketplace or in the home.  A portion of the production is dispatched to Sikasso and to Bamako (capital of the Republic of Mali) and is sold on credit, payable monthly, and sometimes by cash, to customers essentially made up of women and retailers.  \r\n<p>With this new loan, she intends to realize a monthly profit of 100,000 francs CFA that she intends to use to cover the loan interest and to help with family expenses, the bulk of which falls upon her shoulders.  \r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, a Kiva volunteer<b><p>\r\n\r\nMadame Agn\u00e8s Berth\u00e9 est \u00e2g\u00e9e de 36 ans et  vit avec ses 3 enfants (1 gar\u00e7on et 2 filles) son mari et des parents dans une grande famille traditionnelle \u00e9largie au quartier K\u00f4k\u00f4 de la pr\u00e9fecture de Koutiala (troisi\u00e8me r\u00e9gion \u00e9conomique du Mali)\r\n<p>Depuis sa tendre enfance elle commence les activit\u00e9s g\u00e9n\u00e9ratrices de revenus de toutes sortes, mais d\u00e9cide finalement de se sp\u00e9cialiser dans la transformation des graines de n\u00e9r\u00e9 en Sounbala (un condiment alimentaire naturel aux vertus multiples) qu\u2019elle apprena tr\u00e8s t\u00f4t aupr\u00e8s de sa maman (comme la plupart des femmes de son ethnie : les Minianka).

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":303499,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty Salon","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"To purchase dryers and to renovate her building","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mwanza","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.516667 32.9","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-04-14T21:10:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Zainabu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-04-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-27T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-05-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:14:42Z","rounded_local_amount":106160,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613717},{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-06-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:02:28Z","rounded_local_amount":106160,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010796},{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-07-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:39:15Z","rounded_local_amount":106160,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63233082},{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-08-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:53:29Z","rounded_local_amount":106160,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73664873},{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-09-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T02:46:39Z","rounded_local_amount":106160,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87105585}],"funded_date":"2009-04-15T05:18:16Z","paid_date":"2009-10-16T02:46:39Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Susan Sharfman","image":562243}},{"id":105672,"name":"Eugenia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Eugenia es socia del Banco Comunal Reto\u00f1o.\nEugenia es conviviente, tiene 39 a\u00f1os y 3 hijos, Eugenia vende hoja de coca de manera ambulatoria en el mercado Nery Garc\u00eda, sus productos los adquiere en la selva ayacuchana a donde viaja semanalmente.\nEugenia necesita un pr\u00e9stamo de 1500 soles dinero que ser\u00e1 invertido en la compra de hoja de coca.\nEugenia sue\u00f1a con comprar una casa y mejorar su negocio.\n","en":"Eugenia is a member of the Banco Comunal Reto\u00f1o.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

business. They started with one piglet that they raised and sold. This is their source of income to support the basic needs of their four children and their education. However, the hog business alone cannot finance the family's financial needs, therefore Salvacion also sells fish. Even with all of her hard work and perseverance, the business wasn't stable because of insufficient business capital. In 2003, Salvacion joined Ahon Sa HIrap, Inc. (ASHI). She took out a loan from the institution to finance her business. As a result of the loans she received, her business has grown and she has been able to send all of her children to school. Three are high school graduates and her 8 year old youngest child is in elementary school. \r\n\r\nOut of the profits her business had generated, Salvacion was able to buy a motorcycle. Her desire for taking out a larger loan from ASHI is to increase her hog business and her profits to be able to buy a sidecar to attach to her motorcycle for a tricycle for hire business in the future.\r\n\r\nTricycle is one of the most common means of transportation all over the province. With this business, Salvacion could provide a daily income for her family's needs. She also hoped that out of her business profits her two children who are still in school will graduate from college."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":372713,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To

She is 67 years old. Benita is married and has 8 adult-aged children. To make a living, Benita owns and operates a general store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from selling a variety of different products in the local community. Benita has been engaged in her business for over 50 years and earns approximately 1,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2001, Benita joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Benita successfully repaid a previous loan of 10000 PHP from PMPC, which was used to to purchase additional products to sell. Benita is requesting a new loan of 10000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional inventory and as working capital. This loan will be the 11th loan taken out by Benita from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n<p>\r\nAbout PMPC\r\n<p>\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n<p>\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

This district is part of the province and region of Piura, and is located three hours away from the city of Chiclayo.\r\n<p>\r\nLike most of the women in the area, Isabel has been preparing and selling \u201c<a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Chicha\" target=\"_blank\" >chicha<\/a>\u201d for twenty years.  She also raises and sells animals.  Chicha is a traditional Peruvian beverage made of corn and is consumed during ancestral ceremonies.  Many people who live in rural areas drink it during parties and before starting their chores since they believe it provides strength and energy.  \r\n<p>\r\nIsabel prepares chicha twice a week in her home and sells it to her neighbors.  She also raises farm animals at home to sell to the merchants who regularly pass through the area.  Isabel wants to acquire supplies so that she can continue producing chicha.  In addition, she wishes to purchase balanced feed to improve the quality of her animals and generate better earnings when she sells them.  In order to accomplish this goal, she is requesting her first loan from Edpyme Alternativa in the amount of 500 PEN.  \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":556981,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Liquor Store \/ Off-License","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Purchase ingredients for making \"chicha\" & feed for her animals","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Cura Mori - Piura","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":143,"posted_date":"2010-06-22T00:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":200,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Isabel ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-05-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":43.36},{"due_date":"2010-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":44.26},{"due_date":"2010-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":46.18},{"due_date":"2010-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":46.48},{"due_date":"2010-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":49.86},{"due_date":"2010-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":50.49},{"due_date":"2010-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":51.93},{"due_date":"2011-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":54.26},{"due_date":"2011-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":55.72},{"due_date":"2011-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":57.46}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.34},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.71},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.47},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.59},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":19.95},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.19},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.77},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.71},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.29},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.98}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":17.34,"local_amount":43.36,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:38:29Z","rounded_local_amount":49.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151878358},{"amount":17.71,"local_amount":44.26,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T10:50:39Z","rounded_local_amount":50.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159618392},{"amount":18.47,"local_amount":46.18,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:02:07Z","rounded_local_amount":52.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166832787},{"amount":18.59,"local_amount":46.48,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T09:56:36Z","rounded_local_amount":52.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172099391},{"amount":19.95,"local_amount":49.86,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-16T10:42:09Z","rounded_local_amount":56.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177554788},{"amount":20.19,"local_amount":50.49,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T13:45:21Z","rounded_local_amount":57.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182530194},{"amount":42.48,"local_amount":106.19,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T02:55:52Z","rounded_local_amount":120.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191409659},{"amount":45.27,"local_amount":113.18,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T10:48:22Z","rounded_local_amount":128.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201270237}],"funded_date":"2010-06-22T10:15:30Z","paid_date":"2011-04-15T10:48:22Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ronan Reodica","image":498323}},{"id":213047,"name":"Berta","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Berta es socia del Banco Comunal Santa Rita.\nBerta es casada y tiene 2 hijas que ya son independientes, Berta tiene un taller de confecci\u00f3n en su casa en donde confecciona ropa t\u00edpica, actividad que realiza junto a su esposo, sus productos los vende en el mercado, adem\u00e1s Berta vende comida t\u00edpica los d\u00edas domingos en su casa.\nBerta solicita un pr\u00e9stamo de 1000 soles dinero que ser\u00e1 invertido en la compra de telas.\nLos sue\u00f1os de Berta son comprar un carro para que realice transporte publico y seguir trabajando.\n","en":"Berta is a member of the communal bank Santa Rita.\r\n\r\nBerta is married and has two children who are already independent.

She thanks you for your support.<\/p> \r\n\r\n<p>SELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility as a practical way to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women. Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions as they lack tangible collateral assets. This leads to poor financial support hence poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. When a client needs working capital to buy a specific item, SELFINA buys the equipment for said client and extends a loan to her. The same equipment is then leased back to the client so she can use it while in process of paying back her loan, a process called a sale and leaseback arrangement. Once the loan has been repaid, SELFINA transfers ownership of the equipment to the client.

De Cristo Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Asociacion D. Cristo is a group comprised of 15 people, all from the same area in San Pedro, Dominican Republic. Each member has already received a previous loan, and gotten a start on their own small business. This will actually be the third loan that each member receives, and each member has experienced success with their previous two loans. Many members didn't have any form of income before their first loan, so this is their opportunity to change their lives, and to have a more hopeful future.\r\n\r\nAlicia P. is the chosen group representative, and it's obvious why because she is fun and outgoing. She is the mother of 4 children and lives with them and her husband. Before her first loan she didn't contribute any money to the family and had to rely completely on her husband. She felt useless and wanted to do more. She loves her children more than anything and knew that she needed to start making some money to help give them a better life. She then went to Esperanza International and took out her first loan. With the loan she started a small fruit and vegetable business in her area. She is a diligent worker and through time she was able to pay back all her loans and save some money.\r\n\r\nNow she is hoping to receive her third loan, which will enable her to start selling a wider variety of fruits and vegetables. She is happy with the way her business is running and believes that she can continue to expand. She is now an important contributor to her family and feels that she can proviD. for her children. She dreams of putting all her children through college, and she is on the right path! For the first time in her life she is excited for the future and knows she is going to break the cycle of poverty.

Para el futuro, Sivi espera tener una gran f\u00e1brica, donde tenga a muchas personas trabajando y as\u00ed abastecer grandes pedidos de ropa. Este es el primer pr\u00e9stamo individual de Sivi con Microfinanzas PRISMA, y promete ser muy puntual en todos sus pagos, como lo fue anteriormente con su banco comunal. Invertir\u00e1 el dinero que solicita en comprar material (telas, cierres, hilos, etc.) y as\u00ed mejorar la producci\u00f3n de su taller encamin\u00e1ndose a la ampliaci\u00f3n.","en":"Sivi is 42 and single.  She has three children; Carlos is 21, Joel is16, and Ruth is 11.  She only lives with the last two since the first child is independent.\r\n\r\nFor ten years she has been making and selling clothes.  She learned to do this from her parents when she was very little.  They worked in this business to take care of their family.  She has chosen to do the same work together with her sister and a pair of ladies who help her in her small shop.  Her work starts when orders are placed.  Sivi then makes the ordered number of items, which is usually in the hundreds.  She then travels to the city of Tumbes, which is where she sells her merchandise.  Her sister travels to the border with Ecuador to sell in larger quantities since there is a big demand there for her clothes.\r\n\r\nIn the future, Sivi hopes to have a big factory with a lot of people working and filling large clothing orders.\r\n\r\nThis is her first individual loan with Microfinanzas Prisma.  She promises to be punctual with all of her payments, just like she was in the past with her community bank.  She will use the loan to buy material (fabric, zippers, thread, etc.).  That way she will improve her shop\u2019s production on her way to expansion. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":322497,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"To buy materials for her clothes making shop","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-05-23T18:10:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sivi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-04-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2009-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2009-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2009-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2009-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2009-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":166.65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":263.99,"local_amount":791.98,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T00:59:24Z","rounded_local_amount":803.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44596305},{"amount":79.92,"local_amount":239.76,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:45:07Z","rounded_local_amount":243.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52990585},{"amount":156.1,"local_amount":468.26,"processed_date":"2009-07-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:45:27Z","rounded_local_amount":475.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63211696},{"amount":174.08,"local_amount":522.23,"processed_date":"2009-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:29:36Z","rounded_local_amount":530.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73641217},{"amount":161.56,"local_amount":484.68,"processed_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:43:15Z","rounded_local_amount":491.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87080657},{"amount":164.35,"local_amount":493.09,"processed_date":"2009-10-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:15:29Z","rounded_local_amount":500.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96996784}],"funded_date":"2009-05-23T22:47:12Z","paid_date":"2009-11-16T03:15:29Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ginny Kalish"}},{"id":113880,"name":"Djalolkhon","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"D.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.<P>\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.<P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Rivera is 41 years old and lives in the community of Viloma in the province of Sipe Sipe within the city of Cochabamba. It is about 20 kilometers to the city. He works as a farmer, and his wife works in milk production.\r\n\r\nHe has worked in the field since he was very young. He grew up without his parents and was raised by his grandmother, who passed away three years ago. He still misses her because she was like his mother and thanks to her he learned how to be a responsible, hard-working man. He is dedicated to his family; he is married with three small children, who he teaches to be good people. He would never leave his children or his wife. He works as hard as he can so that they do not lack for food. He starts his day in the morning helping his wife milk the cows and after that he cuts alfalfa and works his land. Occasionally he works as a mason too.\r\n \r\nHe needs a the loan to purchase farm machinery which will make his work much easier. He will be able to deliver feed for the cows in much less time and thus have more time to spend with his children and wife because he has to start work very early. He works so that his children can have a better future and he dreams of seeing his children finishing university, working as professionals, and having a better life than he has. His abandonment by his parents still bothers him, but he thanks God for his grandmother because she was the best thing that happened in his life. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by

She has studied to be a pharmacist and works in the health center of Omereque, located in the southern region of Cochabamba. \r\n\r\nLidia travels to Omereque every two weeks and goes to visit her mother in the region of La Maica, since she is the youngest daughter and the only one who accompanies her at home. She can already earn her own salary, although in Bolivia the salaries in the health sector are not very high. Furthermore, Lidia is only in charge of the health center's pharmacy, and she must pay rent since she doesn't own property in Omereque. Occasionally, when she has to make an emergency visit to her mother, she cannot afford to travel. However, this is the sacrifice she must make to fulfill her mother's dream of seeing her become a pharmacist. She has been working like this for almost two years, and her wish is to take her mother to Omereque so they can live there together. However, currently she does not earn enough income to support her mother, who has worked her whole life in a creamery but now finds herself worn out and older in age. Also, she suffers from rheumatism and will not be able to carry on this activity much longer.\r\n\r\nLidia has requested this loan to be able to start up a pharmaceutical business in Omereque. She has been able to see in this small town that the population needs a pharmacy that can attend to them during the hours when the health center is closed. Also, with this income she will be able to fulfill her desire to live together with her mother and also care for her.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Mark Broscoe, Kiva

Lipayo, Dauin, Negros Oriental. She earns her living by operating two business ventures, a general store and a house rental business. Adela joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2000 because she aspired to achieve something better for her family. With the help of her past 17 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Adela has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 12000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 7000, uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her 18th loan cycle, she is borrowing PHP 12000, which she intends to use to restock her general store so that she may continue to save up for the future expansion of her businesses. Adela A. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Senior citizens have to worry about their financial condition, while as a matter of principle, they should have a quiet, carefree life. Such professions as a teacher, an engineer and a doctor were considered the most prestigious ones. But nowadays, the salary of teachers is so miserable that most of them have to start a business here or leave for another country to work at a worthy job. This story is about a teacher and a retiree, who happen to fight for a convenient life regardless of their degree and age.\r\n\r\nMakun M. is a 58-year-old retiree. She\u2019s the leader of this group.  She\u2019s a resident of Tokmok and after the death of her husband, she was left alone with her son. Unfortunately  the amount of her pension is too small for giving her son a quality education. So Makun had to go into business.  Four years ago, she took a loan to get her poultry-keeping business started. She became experienced in taking care of animals and decided to go on to the next level. She hopes to succeed in getting this loan and spend it on broadening her poultry business and purchasing a calf and hay.  If this brings her much income, she would like to get a cow also and start a dairy business. \r\n\r\nZeinep Y., 24, is a young entrepreneur. She is busy with selling vegetables and fruits at the market. So after gaining this loan, she plans to increase the commodity circulation of her business.\r\n\r\nRahima B., 50, has one 20-year-old daughter. Rahima is a dispatcher in the bus terminal of Tokmok. After a while, she decided that she could run a business at the same time. She bought livestock and gave it to her brother for breeding. Rahima applied to this loan for purchasing a calf and gaining as much profit from it as possible. \r\n\r\nRaliya Y., 47, is a teacher in high school. Raliya\u2019s husband is a welder and they are the proud parents of five children. She lives by the bus terminal and started a business in the market nearby. This loan she plans to spend on increasing her commodity circulation and opening a second small shop.  \r\n\r\n<b>Where Did This Loan Come From?<\/b>\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance (MBF), a young, ambitious and socially-focused microfinance institution in Kyrgyzstan. \r\n\r\nMBF is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development and upholds the triple \"P\" bottom line \u2013 People (building human capital and taking care of its customers as well as society), Planet (keeping environmentally friendly) and Profit (earning revenue to expand autonomously).

Nabulao, Sipalay City, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating three business ventures: a vegetable-selling business, a rice-selling business, and a general store. Her husband, Erwin T., who is 42 years old, works as a laborer to earn his living, and also helps with his wife's business activities.  They have two children who are 12 and 13 years old. <p>\r\n\r\nElma joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1993 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of 18 prior loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Elma has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan in the amount of 22,000 PHP helped her earn a monthly profit of 5,000 PHP, thereby improving her family's standard of living.  This time, for her 19th loan, she is seeking to borrow a loan in the amount of 18,000 PHP ($425), which she intends to use to buy vegetables to sell so that she can continue to save up for future home repairs and her children's education. Elma T. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. <p>\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon -- a Hiligaynon word that means \"honorable.\" Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon -- a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Oripha is contented with the farming way of life. \n\nOripha is a very enterprising woman, and although she never had formal education or formal employment, she has always worked hard on her farm and she has always assured her children and family a decent meal. The Kiirua, Nkubu area has favorable conditions for horticulture farming, and that is why she is seeking a loan to buy seeds and start horticulture farming. Because of good roads, a good climate, and a good transportation network, she is sure that she will reap maximum profits and be able to increase her business. \n\nBeing a woman and accessing funds in Kenya is very challenging, but Oripha feels relieved knowing there are institutions such as KIVA that help enterprising women like her. Oripha is well disciplined with finances and she plans that through the accumulated profits, she will be able to improve her living conditions and secure the future of her children, who are in primary school. \n\nAs the December season is approaching, Oripha wants to close the year on a high note.

(first row right) is the head master of RC Teko (Upper). He has been a teacher for over nineteen years now. Ibrahim was born in Makeni, northern Sierra Leone. He is age forty-nine, married to a businesswoman and they have five children. One of their child is in nursery, the other is in class II, the other is in Junior Secondary School I (JSS I) and the eldest is in Senior Secondary School I (SSS I). Mr. Kargbo will use his loan to buy house building materials like cements and corrugated iron zincs. This will enable him start building a house and with the help of subsequent loans, he is optimistic that he will be able to complete building a house for himself and children. \r\n\r\nRC Teko School was established by the Roman Catholics in 1977 with the aim of educating the children of military personnel at the Makeni Military barracks, Teko, and to spread the Roman Catholic faith. RC Teko is divided into a Lower and Upper primary schools respectively. The Lower is made up of classes I \u2013 III and the Upper is made of classes IV \u2013 V. RC Teko (Upper) has a total of sixteen staff and 435 pupils.\r\n\r\nAmongst the many constrains that this school suffers are the lack of sufficient class-rooms and seating accommodations for the pupils.
