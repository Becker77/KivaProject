She lives with her daughter Katy, age 20, in her own home in the Palcamayo area. From her childhood, she has worked in agriculture and with livestock; \"I took care of my parents' pigs and helped with the harvest\", she says. With time, she invested her strength and time in improving; so when she was young, she worked as a baker for 10 years. She still sells breads, cakes and other products. From her earnings, she has been able to save money and purchase her own land to cultivate vegetables, products which she sells wholesale in the central market of the capital. She recently opened a small store in her home. This way, she will be able to generate additional income for herself. Working in agriculture does not give her enough income, so she found it necessary to find a partner to help her with the sowing and the harvest, so that she only works alone on her land until harvest time. Her greatest wish is to purchase and sell land and to continue supporting her daughter in her agribusiness studies. This is her tenth loan with MFP, and she is grateful for the support that her community bank has offered her in the development of her goals. With the 1000 soles that she is requesting, she will invest in the purchase of fertilizer for her next harvest, and pay her daughter's tuition.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Christine Cooper, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":604533,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase bags of fertilizer","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:22Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Celia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-09-06T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":375}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":375,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:41:02Z","rounded_local_amount":1048.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211269331}],"funded_date":"2010-10-04T05:58:32Z","paid_date":"2011-06-15T11:41:02Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Christine Cooper","image":1766620}},{"id":237268,"name":"Juana Liliana","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"En las afueras de Portoviejo en Km 5 v\u00eda Manta  encontramos el Banco Comunal Loma De Los Vientos, que se re\u00fanen cada quince d\u00edas, lugar de gente dedicada a la agricultura y cr\u00eda de animales.\n\nLa se\u00f1ora Liliana tiene 26 a\u00f1os de edad y mantiene una relaci\u00f3n de uni\u00f3n libre de la cual tiene tres hijos de 6, 5, y una hermosa bebita de un a\u00f1o,  su marido trabaja en una granja de pollos, tiene una casa de ca\u00f1a.\n\nVende cartillas que es una modalidad de venta de artefactos en sistema acumulativo.

Previously, he sold vegetables wholesale and retail at a food market and then decided to change his speciality.  Since then, his income rose and currently amounts to 6 000 hryvnia.  Ivan plans to use the 7 000 hryvnia Kiva loan to buy winter tires and make regular repairs to his car engine.  This business is Ivan's primary source of income.  One of the goals that Ivan sets for himself is to purchase a newer car.  In the future, Ivan plans to continue working in this field because for now he does not see other, more interesting

In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries, and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a small amount of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns a profit by buying supplies at wholesale prices and reselling them by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 400 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help continue operations of her business, she is requesting a loan of PHP 22,000. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nAmelita dreams of being able to give her all her children a good and high quality education through her hard work in her business. She also hopes to have her own grocery store. She faithfully meets with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and to draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God, which  she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

Maria M. is married with four children.  She sells dried fish, vegetables, rice and candies in the village of Kikurala in Northern Sierra Leone. <P>Maria has been in business for five years but due to lack of capital, she could not make enough profit to expand and diversify her business.

All the previous loans have all been paid back in full and on time, and now they hope to receive an even larger loan. This group of 20 hardworking people have all started to realize that they have the ability to change their future, and have all started to experience some success. Receiving a 7th loan is not something that all borrowers end up getting to, and that is in it self a great testament to the character and hard work of this group.<p>\r\n\r\nYnes J. is the group representative, and a perfect example to represent this group. Ynes is a very outgoing, hardworking mother to 3 children. She is an extremely loving mother and has done everything in her power to proviD. her children with everything she never had. Ynes has lived in extreme poverty her whole life, and decided a few years back that she wanted to change her future and the future of her family. She received her first loan from Esperanza International and started a small salon from her house. From there she kept working hard and kept increasing the services and products of her salon, and today she has a very successful business. She can finally afford to pay for all of life's basic necessities, and even some luxuries. She has never been happier than she is now, and feels like she can beat poverty. The best part is that she is a testament to her children that they don't have to accept poverty as part of their lives, and can create a better life. Ynes is very excited about the future and is happy with the changes SHE maD. in her life! She is on the right path, and ready to keep increasing her business.<p>\r\n\r\nThank you for your support of Ynes, and the group.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3675,"image":{"id":271209,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty

Todos sus hermanos se fueron a Lima en busca de un mejor porvenir, y le han propuesto irse con ellos, pero \u00e9l prefiere apostar por el arte de labrar la tierra, como \u00e9l llama a la agricultura, ya que le gusta mucho esta actividad. A\u00f1os atr\u00e1s solo sembraba en chacras temporales (regadas por la lluvia), y sus cosechas eran en los meses abril a mayo.

Han pasado m\u00e1s de tres a\u00f1os y por fin est\u00e1 viendo los frutos de su esfuerzo. Ahora sus cosechas son  cada dos o tres veces por a\u00f1o, y cree haber aprendido las t\u00e9cnicas para convertirse en un gran agricultor.

","en":"Nazario is about to turn 30, he is single, and still lives in his mother's house along with his sister.  His other siblings all left for Lima to look for a better future, and have proposed that he go with them, but he prefers to stay and work the land, as he refers to agriculture, since he really likes this activity.  Many years ago he only farmed small plots of land (watered by the rain), and his harvests were in the months of April and May.  But he wanted a change from renting land and changed all the seeds according to the type of land.  More than three years have passed and he is finally seeing the fruit of his labor.  Now his crops are harvested two or three times a year, and he believes he has learned the techniques to become a great farmer.  His upcoming goals are to farm on the coast, since he has a large quantity of seeds especially for  that climate.  In this way he will increase his production which will increase his earnings and make his work a very profitable activity.  Last year Nazario was the president of his community bank, and he completed all his tasks very well.  This is his eighth loan with MFP and in all this time he has shown responsibility in his payments.  The money he is asking for is for buying chemical fertilizers for planting his new coastal crops.  \r\n <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Emily Meinecke, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":292722,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To purchase fertilizers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-03-23T18:40:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":500,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nazario","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-03-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":500}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":500,"local_amount":1500,"processed_date":"2009-09-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:32:55Z","rounded_local_amount":1552.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87080275}],"funded_date":"2009-03-23T20:43:08Z","paid_date":"2009-10-15T23:32:55Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Emily Meinecke","image":557397}},{"id":101232,"name":"Vun","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Vun H., 55, and her husband, Mr. Den Yem, 57, live on an Island in Mekong River about fifteen kilometers from Phnom Penh.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <p>\r\n\t\r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous, and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment, forcing hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <p>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<p>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Francisca Zoila is a member of the Hope Communal Bank, which is in the District of Juanjui, Mariscal C\u00e1ceres Province, Department of San Mart\u00edn.  She is 46 years old, single, and the mother of 3 children of whom 2 are still dependents.\r\n<p>\r\nFrancisca has been engaged in sewing for 24 years.  With the help of a little capital, she took the initiative to utilize her sewing skills by opening a dressmaking shop out of her house.  Her business is well suited for welcoming customers, whom she greets with her friendly and charming personality.  \r\n<p>\r\nFrancisca informs us that her business is doing well.  Her customers place their orders in advance.  One of her goals is to open a boutique selling couture fashions and manufacture the garments using modern industrial equipment.  With her loan of 1500 soles, she will purchase a sewing machine and an <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Overlock\" target=\"_blank\" >overlock stitcher<\/a> because her current equipment is in disrepair.  In addition, Francisca will use any leftover money to buy pins, scissors, and paper molds.\r\n<p>\r\nToday Francisca feels she is an accomplished woman and continues to strive for her other dreams. She thanks Manuela Ramos for helping her start her business and supporting many more women who want to grow as entrepreneurs.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":422307,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"Purchase sewing equipment & materials","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"San Mart\u00edn","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":72,"posted_date":"2009-11-09T23:10:17Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":525,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Francisca Zoila ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-10-09T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2010-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2010-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2010-03-09T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2010-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:43:03Z","rounded_local_amount":253.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103835891},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T15:08:58Z","rounded_local_amount":253.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110727663},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2010-01-09T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:05:32Z","rounded_local_amount":253.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118118033},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2010-02-09T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:43:33Z","rounded_local_amount":253.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123953757},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2010-03-09T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-23T07:54:10Z","rounded_local_amount":253.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128986876},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2010-04-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-02T07:56:08Z","rounded_local_amount":253.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136713014}],"funded_date":"2009-11-10T10:23:50Z","paid_date":"2010-06-02T07:56:08Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ronan Reodica","image":498323}},{"id":154660,"name":"Mrs. Youren Say Village Bank Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sixteen people, who are all living in Prek Ta Ker village in Kandal province, make up this village bank loan.

She is married and the mother of three children who are still dependent on her.  She finished secondary school.  Juliana has cooperated with the Manuela Ramos Movement for the last 4 years.  She has different business activities like:  buying and selling regional products, buying and selling clothing, and buying and selling cheese (she sells in Arequipa and Ilave).  She tells us that her first loan was for 300 new soles.  She bought chu\u00f1o (freeze-dried potatoes), potatoes and cheese that she sold in Arequipa.  She is requesting 3000 new soles to buy a bull; any remainder she will use to buy regional products.  Her vision for the future is to be a wholesaler and have a fixed locale in Arequipa to sell her products.  What she likes most about her communal bank is the low-interest loans and the talks with the members.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva

The women live in different areas of the city of Cuenca, the third most important city in Ecuador.  The city is surrounded by spectacular scenery that captivates visitors and residents alike.  A member of the community bank El Cr\u00e9dito, Mrs. Monica J. lives in the city of Cuenca, and gets along with all her colleagues at the cooperative.  She is 38 years old and lives with her common-law partner and two children, aged 20 and 15 years.  Her eldest child (daughter) studies at the Ciudad de Cuenca college, and her son attends the Octavio Cordero Palacios school.  Ms. J.\u2019s partner is a builder whose work provides a steady income for the family.  The family live in rented accommodation.  \n\nMonica has been selling fish soup for the past five years.  She does this from her house and works from 9am till 10pm every day except on Thursday, when she rests to spend time with her family.  Monica taught herself how to run her business out of necessity and a wish to better herself, and reports that things are going well.  This is Ms. J.\u2019s second loan cycle as part of the Fundaci\u00f3n after a friend encouraged her to form the collective and informed her about the benefits such a group could receive.

R. lives in the neighborhood of Villa Sol de Soledad.  She has three children between the ages of 10 and 16.  Yarely previously worked for a company and also had a side business preparing and selling food.  However, her health began to deteriorate and now works as an independent sales representative offering products such as cosmetics, kitchenware, accessories, and silver jewelry through specialized catalogs.  Yarely also manages a small store in the house of her godmother, who has provided her with much support.\r\n<p>\r\nFour years ago, Yarely started her business when a friend also joined the catalog program.  She now shows her products through a promotional system and selects only those customers who have the ability to pay in order to avoid losing money.  Yarely says she has been able to move her children forward and make all the necessary efforts to grow her business.  She receives a great deal of financial and emotional support from her husband, who helps her to remain calm.\r\n<p>\r\nAt the moment, she is requesting a loan from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo in the amount of 2,000,000 COP to purchase items from which she will receive commission such as costume jewelry, cosmetics, and perfumes.  Yarely has participated in the FMSD programs for two years and says this loan will increase her capital so that she can begin investing in the construction of her house.  She also says FMSD allowed her to get out of a job that was damaging to her health and work independently.  In addition, she believes that the organization gives financial access to good clients like her who cannot afford to conduct business in cash but have opportunities to take advantage of sales promotions for products offered in the catalogs.  \r\n<p>\r\nHer dream is to finish her house, which is in the advanced stages of construction, and make it more habitable.  She hopes to spend time with her family because she currently lives at her parents\u2019 house.  Yarely wants her children to become prepared and take advantage of her efforts to create opportunities for them while they are healthy and young.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She thanks you for your support.\r\n\r\nOver 70% of Nepal's economy is agricultural. Typically, Nepali households grow crops on small plots of terraced land. Rice (bhat), lentils (daal), and vegetables (thakari) are the staples of the Nepali diet. With a Kiva loan, BPW's borrowers are able to purchase greater amounts of seed and fertilizer.  With more seeds and fertilizer, a borrower is able to grow cash crops to be sold in the local market. Such crops allow households to move beyond subsistence and provide much-needed cash income throughout the year. \r\n\r\nThis loan was administered by Kiva's local partner microfinance institution, Patan Business and Professional Women. Patan BPW became Kiva's first field partner in Nepal in 2007. Patan BPW operates throughout the Kathmandu Valley, offering microcredit and business training programs to low-income women. In addition to providing economic opportunity to their clients, Patan BPW seeks to empower Nepali women within the home and community.

She is married and has five children, four of whom are in school.  Catherine has a business of food vending. She has been in this business for 20 years and she works seven days out of every week. Catherine sells her products in a shop on a retail basis.    \r\n\r\nCatherine has requested a loan of 800,000 Ugandan Shillings from MCDT SACCO. She will use it to buy more bags of cassava and sweet potatoes and bunches of bananas. She also generates additional income through selling charcoal. \r\n\r\nThe main business challenges for Catherine include transport and seasonality.

All of her three children realized how hard the parents work so two of them try to be independent and earn their own livings.  Her youngest child is still in primary school, so she still need to pay for his tuition.  She saw the opportunity to expand her pig farm.  She started with only one pig, and now she owns 3 growing pigs.  Each pigs were bought for $25 and farmed for 2 months before sold to a butchery or restaurant for $45.  So she earns about $60 from 3 pigs.  Jero Darsini plays a big part in earning the family income as her husband's contract farming income is not sufficient.  She hopes to expand her farm and increase her profit.  She hopes to use the loan from DINARI to achieve that.  Jero Darsini is trying to renovate her simple home using the additional profit from the business.\r\n\r\n<p><b>Translated from Indonesian by Kresna Hartandi, Kiva Volunteer<\/p><\/b>\r\n\r\nJero Darsini dalam kehidupan sehari- harinya terbiasa untuk bekerja keras dalam membantu suaminya, Gusti Ketut Rauh, dalam memenuhi segala kebutuhan hidup keluarganya. Tiga orang anaknya sudah merasakan bagaimana uletnya orang tua mereka ini hingga dua diantaranya sudah mampu mandiri dan bekerja, sedangkan anaknya yang masih di sekolah dasar masih harus di biayai pendidikannya. Dari keuletannya dalam menjalankan usaha ternak babi, Jero Darsini melihat ada peluang untuk bisa mengembangkan usahanya. Dimulai dari hanya memelihara seekor babi sampai akhirnya  Jero Darsini memelihara 3 ekor babi penggemukan. Babi tersebut dibeli dengan harga Rp 225.000,- per ekor yang  dipelihara selama 2 bulan  dan di jual kepada pengusaha babi guling dengan harga Rp.400.000, jadi Jero Darsini mendapat pendapatan kotor Rp 525.000 dari ke 3 ekor ternaknya. Dari hasil usahanya inilah Jero Darsini menunjukkan perannya menjadi penopang keuangan keluarga karena penghasilan suaminya sebagai petani tidak cukup untuk memenuhi semua kebutuhan keluarga. Dalam perkembangan usahanya Jero Darsini selalu berharap bisa lebih maju lagi karena kebutuhan hidup semakin meningkat dan lewat pinjaman modal yang diperolehnya dari DINARI besar harapannya bisa mengembangkan usahanya karena Jero Darsini juga sedang berupaya memperbaiki keadaan rumahnya yang sangat sederhana

She wants to start selling charcoal and later become a wholesaler, distributing to other small traders so as to increase her income base.\r\n\r\nIn the future, Lucy hopes to open and stock a general shop, in addition to constructing more rental houses on her extensive property.\r\n\r\nAbout KADET:\r\nThe Kenya Agency for the Development of Enterprise and Technology (KADET) is committed to economically empowering its clients by providing financial services in order to relieve suffering and improve living conditions in communities across Kenya.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":372143,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Charcoal Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To start up a new charcoal sales business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kirigu, Kikuyu","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":133,"posted_date":"2009-08-18T17:10:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":275,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lucy ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-08-03T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":3334},{"due_date":"2009-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":3334},{"due_date":"2009-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":3334},{"due_date":"2009-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":3334},{"due_date":"2010-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":3334},{"due_date":"2010-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":3330}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.84},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.85},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.84},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.84},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.84},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.79}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":45.84,"local_amount":3334,"processed_date":"2009-09-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T21:22:11Z","rounded_local_amount":3504.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87063268},{"amount":178.85,"local_amount":13007,"processed_date":"2009-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T00:47:52Z","rounded_local_amount":13672.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96978156},{"amount":50.31,"local_amount":3659,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:57:50Z","rounded_local_amount":3846.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118107022}],"funded_date":"2009-08-18T21:18:58Z","paid_date":"2010-02-15T11:57:50Z","journal_totals":{"entries":5,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Gina Kessler","image":null}},{"id":134052,"name":"Chroeb","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Chroeb H. is 32 years old and she lives in Ank Kor Ky village in Takeo province.

She is 36 years old. Raulene is married and has 4 school aged children. To make a living, Raulene owns & operates a business venture in the retail sector and operates a specialized \"sari-sari\" retail store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling assorrted products in the local community. Raulene has been engaged in her business for over 2 years and earns approximately 8,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Raulene joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Raulene is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Raulene from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three units offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

Red Light is the country's largest market, and is about ten kilometers from the capital, Monrovia. It is a bustling area full of shops, stalls, and vendors\u2019 tables.\r\n\r\nGarma is 36 years old and is unmarried but has a partner. \"My first man died,\" she says, \"But I have a second man.\" Garma has three children: a three-year-old girl and two boys aged 12 and 16; her boys both attend school. Garma herself never went to school, but instead worked with her mother who operated a dry foodstuffs business similar to Garma's. Garma's parents have both passed away.\r\n\r\nGarma sells beans, peppers, mustard seed, and other dry foodstuffs from a table at the Red Light market. She says she's been at her current location for three years. This is her first loan from Kiva partner LEAP, and she plans to use her 5,000 Liberian dollar portion of the 24,000 Liberian dollar group loan to buy more inventory for her business.\r\n\r\nGarma hopes that her business will be even more successful. She says she looks forward to the day when her children can help her with the business, and hopes that they will be able to take care of her when she gets old.\r\n\r\nIn the photo, Garma is the one holding the sign. \r\n\r\n\r\n<b>About LEAP:<\/b>\r\nThe Local Enterprise Assistance Program (LEAP) is Liberia's largest and oldest continuously operating micro-finance institution with thirteen branches across the country. Founded in 1994, the non-profit organization has survived periods of civil war and severe socio-economic hardship. LEAP seeks to help rebuild post-conflict Liberia through its group and individual loans to micro- and small-scale entrepreneurs, and puts emphasis on lending to women.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":476566,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Market","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To buy dry foodstuffs such as beans, peppers, and mustard seed","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"LR","country":"Liberia","town":"Paynesville, Montserrado County","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"6.5 -9.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":141,"posted_date":"2010-01-24T19:10:13Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Garma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yonker","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yassa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Krubo","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Malay","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-01-20T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"LRD","disbursal_amount":24000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":990},{"due_date":"2010-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":1770},{"due_date":"2010-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":1770},{"due_date":"2010-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":1770},{"due_date":"2010-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1770},{"due_date":"2010-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1770},{"due_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","amount":1770},{"due_date":"2010-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":1770},{"due_date":"2010-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1770},{"due_date":"2010-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":1770},{"due_date":"2010-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":1770},{"due_date":"2010-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1770},{"due_date":"2010-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1770},{"due_date":"2010-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1770}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.44},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.81},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.81},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.82},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.81},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.81},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.81},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.82},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.81},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.81},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.81},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.82},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.81},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.81}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":14.44,"local_amount":990,"processed_date":"2010-02-17T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:42:55Z","rounded_local_amount":1017.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123952528},{"amount":25.81,"local_amount":1770,"processed_date":"2010-02-24T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:43:03Z","rounded_local_amount":1819.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123952529},{"amount":151.01,"local_amount":10355,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:29:05Z","rounded_local_amount":10646.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128985522},{"amount":85.02,"local_amount":5830,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:33:06Z","rounded_local_amount":5993.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136711334},{"amount":28.29,"local_amount":1940,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-17T07:50:22Z","rounded_local_amount":1994.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144997889},{"amount":28.29,"local_amount":1940,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-21T07:43:17Z","rounded_local_amount":1994.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":152755949},{"amount":17.14,"local_amount":1175,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T04:29:55Z","rounded_local_amount":1208.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191456470}],"funded_date":"2010-01-24T20:26:34Z","paid_date":"2011-02-16T04:29:55Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jeff Avery","image":233371}},{"id":175413,"name":"Erika","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Erika, pertenece al Banco Comunal \u201cMar\u00eda Auxiliadora\u201d, Distrito de Tarapoto, Provincia de San Mart\u00edn y Departamento San Mart\u00edn.

She lives in Ntamuche Nkwen, a quarter in Bamenda North West Region of Cameroon.\r\n\r\nChe I. has encountered difficulties in life ranging from the inability to meet her daily needs, and failure to attain a quality education. With this loan, she plans to use part to clear off unwanted weeds from her farm, buy piglets, and buy fertilizer to apply to the soil for a higher yield. She is convinced that the soil does not deceive anyone who works hard. She will use part of the capital to buy vegetable seeds which she will plant, nurture and harvest. She will sell the excess, while her family uses the surplus. The loan will help her community, because she will be able to provide vegetables which are very good for their health. They will not need to incur transport costs to buy it elsewhere in distant places. She will be able to take care of her children\u2019s education. She will plough back her profit into her business and use part to care for her family. She will use a fraction of the profit to pay for her children's education and upgrade her standard of living. \r\n\r\nShe prefers GHAPE because of the training she frequently receives, the follow up, that GHAPE does not ask for collateral securities, and the low cost of obtaining and paying back a loan. And that the payment is gradual.\r\n\r\nAbout GHAPE:\r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon. GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach.

Hernandez. She has a daughter in her care and her name is Laura Patricia. She is 18 years old and she is a preschool teacher. \r\n\r\nThis loan has been invested in the purchase of chickens to later sell as meat (butchered). She has two years in the business and it has been successful. She has been contributing to the household finances, although she also has her husband\u2019s support. He is an agriculturist. \r\n\r\nThe reason she took up a business is to earn her own money and to be able to provide for the expenses generated by the home. She also wants to make her loan payments on time. \r\n\r\nThe earnings that she perceives are invested in the purchase of soft drinks. The loan she requested is also invested in this loan. She mentions that both businesses are doing well. \r\n\r\nHer major goal is to have enough money to support herself and her husband in their old age, to have a source of income form where to have whatever they need for whatever time God grants them. She also wants to see her daughter finish studying for a career. \r\n\r\nThe group's name is Sahuara and they chose the name for a spiny plant by that name. They thought it was a good idea. Four women formed the group and they each have a different business. \r\n\r\nThe members of the group are as follows: \r\n\r\nZoraida L. Velasco: she will invest her loan in the business of buying and selling shoes through a catalogue, especially the Andrea, Pardo, and Terra brand names. \r\n\r\nMaria Estela L.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Being a resident of the northern town of Karabalta, Batmakan raised three children, the oldest of whom is 18 years old. In 1996 after the privatization of land, Batmakan, along with thousands of farmers like her, used her last savings on the purchase of her first head of livestock. \r\n\r\nReselling cattle was just a beginning. Soon she used the daily milk yield to produce sour cream, butter, and cheese. A homemade product raises demand in local area residents, who are pleased with accessible prices and good quality. For the distribution of milk, Batmakan uses her husband\u2019s help, because he is employed in the transportation of food products. Her children make a small contribution to the family business by providing their minor help after school. \r\n\r\nA monthly income of about $214 helped the couple purchase an automobile and several cows. Now Batmakan sometimes buys ready milk products and resells them in a local market. In order to accomplish this she has applied for this loan. Batmakan has deep hopes for her children\u2019s future.

She is married to Eduardo, a painter. She has three children; the oldest is in high school and the other two are in grade school.  She, together with her husband, manages their own household while operating the business.\r\n\r\nRosita operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a Php5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. Rosita earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. They also operate a passenger motorcycle used in transportation around the community.  Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of Php 1000 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue the operations of her business, she is requesting a Php 20,000 loan.

Juhudi Kilimo has been very encouraging and supportive to such progressive farmers.

Celerina took the opportunity because it interested her and provided her with a good income.  At that time, she did not have an income, so she worked as her friend's saleswoman.  Little by little she attracted new clients and sold many products, but her earnings were not that high because she was only the saleswoman.

In addition to working in agriculture he has also worked raising animals, including cows, bulls, sheep, and to a lesser extent guinea pigs.  Of what he grows in his fields he sells one part, and saves the other part in his storeroom for personal consumption during moments of need. \r\n\r\nHis love for his family is what motivates him to endure the extreme heat or cold of the countryside when he is preparing his land for sowing seeds, or when he is preparing for the harvest. This is the second time that Bernardo has sought a loan with MFP. He is pleased to be a member of his local community bank because everyday the members are learning, and it also provides an interesting space for socialising and mutual support. The loan is to buy bags of fertilizer, costing 200 soles each, which will serve him well during the sowing season now approaching. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Sally Bolton, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":950,"image":{"id":259001,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To purchase fertilizer for his crops","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"HUANCAYO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.066667 -75.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-01-21T04:10:11Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":950,"lender_count":31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Bernardo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-14T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":950,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":3000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":950}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":950,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2009-07-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:42:00Z","rounded_local_amount":3027.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63210814}],"funded_date":"2009-01-21T06:16:21Z","paid_date":"2009-08-15T16:42:00Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sally Bolton","image":517266}},{"id":88976,"name":"Mercedes","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Mercedes es socia del Banco Comunal Estrella.\nMercedes es casada, tiene 42 a\u00f1os y 3 hijos, Mercedes vende verduras, frutas, carne, actividad que realiza de manera ambulatoria, para lo cual cuenta con un triciclo, por las ma\u00f1anas se ubica en el mercado de San Juan luego vende de casa en casa.\nMercedes necesita un pr\u00e9stamo de 1200 soles dinero que ser\u00e1 invertido en la compra de frutas y verduras.\nLos sue\u00f1os de Mercedes son tener una tienda en su casa y compra un carro para transportar sus productos.\n","en":"Mercedes is a member of the Estrella (Star) communal bank.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after Tajikistan\u2019s independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \n\nIMON's History\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

They named their group Fight for Shameness. They are local entrepreneurs based in Makeni city, in northern Sierra Leone. This is not the first loan these women have received from SMT\/Kiva. Previous loans have made a significant impact on the lives of these borrowers. They were able to feed their children, send them to school and meet most of their daily financial challenges from the proceeds they make from their businesses. Having repaid their last loan successfully, they have now applied again for a new loan to further strengthen their businesses.\r\n\r\nIsatu K. (right) is the leader of this group.

Mrs. Rurs P. is 35 years old and the mother of five children two of whom are working in a garment factory while other two are attending the local school and the youngest one is too young to work or study because that child is on the age of four years old. \n\nThirteen members in this village bank loans are end-of-term loans and the rest have monthly payment loans. They are not required to pay any principal on the loan until the very end of the loan term.

His income is really a great help in supporting his family's needs.\r\n\r\nIn 2005, Romeo joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Romeo has successfully repaid a previous loan of 25,000 PHP from ASKI. Romeo is requesting a new loan, his 5th, of 25,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional seeds, seedlings and young crops to raise. He plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve his family's general living conditions. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines.

Disfruta mucho las diferentes labores que practica en la chacra, y cuando quiere agilizar su trabajo contrata operarios, de esa manera puede descansar tranquila y sentir seguridad de que obtendr\u00e1 una buena producci\u00f3n. Elsa, es muy precavida, ya que est\u00e1 convencida de que una excelente cosecha depende de las atenciones, por eso considera que su labor en la agricultura es bastante rentable, porque le permite adquirir bienes, educar a sus hijos y puede cubrir diferentes gastos cotidianos. Para su futuro, piensa comprar m\u00e1s terrenos productivos y plantar mayor cantidad de caf\u00e9. Este es la tercera vez que tiene un cr\u00e9dito con MFP, y esta segura de trabajar de manera activa como hasta ahora, pues le gusta laborar co su grupo comunal. Con el cr\u00e9dito que recibir\u00e1, comprar\u00e1 varios sacos de abono, que esparcir\u00e1 sobre sus plantaciones de caf\u00e9.\n\n","en":"Elsa is a very hardworking woman who is 30 years old and lives with her partner Nilton, who is also 30 years old and with whom she has 2 children, who are her adoration. They live together in their own house. She has been working in agriculture for 10 years. Her parents taught her this work and that is why now she and her husband are teaching all of the agricultural techniques to their children, who occasionally help them with small jobs in the field, cultivating coffee, plantains, and avocadoes. She enjoys very much the different kinds of work she does in the fields and when she needs to make her work go more quickly she hires workers. In this way she can rest assured, knowing that she will have good production. \r\n\r\nElsa is very prudent because she is convinced that a good harvest depends on being attentive. She considers her work in agriculture to be quite profitable, because it allows her to buy land, educate her children, and to cover a variety of daily expenses. For the future she plans to buy some more land that is productive and to plant a larger amount of coffee. This is the third time she has had a loan with MFP and she is sure to continue working hard like she has up to this point because she likes working with her communal bank. With the loan she will receive she will buy several sacks of fertilizer, which she will use on her coffee plants. \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jennifer Day, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":580514,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy sacks of fertilizer","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-08-08T23:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elsa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-07-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":550}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":550,"local_amount":1500,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:42:10Z","rounded_local_amount":1540.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211269252}],"funded_date":"2010-08-09T13:51:05Z","paid_date":"2011-06-15T11:42:10Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jennifer Day","image":null}},{"id":225024,"name":"Ankhzaya","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs Ankhzaya is 25 years old.

They have 4 children who are between 2 mos. and 5 years old. \r\n\r\nDan Mery joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2006 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 6 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Dan Mery has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 20,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 7000, uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her 7th loan, she is borrowing PHP 21,000, which she intends to use to pay for more additional capital for the business so that she can continue to save up for the future to have more income for the family. Dan Mery N. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Maribel is 30 years old and a native of the town of Viveros in the State of Michoac\u00e1n.  She likes being married to Sr. Andr\u00e9s, who works as a day laborer.  They have a one year old daughter named Andrea.  Both of them grow and sell flowers of various types.  Their high season is during the months of November and December.  Mari says she learned how to grow flowers from her father, who taught her when she was 12 years old.  She decided to pursue this activity because it generates a very good income, even though it requires a great deal of effort, time, and money.  Mari sells her flowers at the local markets in Mexico City.  She is requesting a loan from Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad in order to buy paper, compost, and insecticides for her flower nursery.  Her challenge at the moment is having enough time and money to invest in her current crop of flowers so that she will have enough to sell.  \r\n<p>\r\nDo\u00f1a Mari says the loan will be a great benefit because she can give her daughter a better quality of life.  Another reason why she wants to stay ahead is so that she can pay her loan back and not fall behind due to a lack of money.  One goal she has for her business is to remodel her nursery since it is made of plastic and has deteriorated as a result of bad weather.  Another goal is to plant avocado trees on the land given to her by her parents.  Mari says, \u201cLater on I want to devote 100% of my time to growing avocados because the fertilizers and composts we use for growing poinsettias are highly toxic and gradually affecting my health as well as that of my husband.\u201d  Her profits from the sale of poinsettias have been good, so she will set aside some of the money to buy fertilizers for next year\u2019s crop of flowers.  Another portion will be used to finish the construction of her home.

She decided that she would not give up until she had a complete beauty salon.

This leads to poor financial support hence poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.\r\n\r\nSELFINA buys and leases equipment to women.

I am the mother of 4 children.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Laure Kwon, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":231389,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty Salon","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"To buy products.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"Danli","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"14.033333 -86.583333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":118,"posted_date":"2008-12-01T08:00:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Delfina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-11-26T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":7000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":1166.67},{"due_date":"2009-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":1166.67},{"due_date":"2009-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":1166.67},{"due_date":"2009-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1166.67},{"due_date":"2009-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1166.67},{"due_date":"2009-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1166.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":49.82,"local_amount":929.95,"processed_date":"2008-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T02:44:42Z","rounded_local_amount":952.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9967714},{"amount":75.18,"local_amount":1403.39,"processed_date":"2009-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T14:59:16Z","rounded_local_amount":1437.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14884164},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":1166.67,"processed_date":"2009-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T20:51:25Z","rounded_local_amount":1194.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20433611},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":1166.67,"processed_date":"2009-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:40:03Z","rounded_local_amount":1194.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27127945},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":1166.67,"processed_date":"2009-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:06:56Z","rounded_local_amount":1194.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36024743},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":1166.65,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T01:56:37Z","rounded_local_amount":1194.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44610645}],"funded_date":"2008-12-03T06:17:29Z","paid_date":"2009-06-16T01:56:37Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"L K","image":355766}},{"id":80800,"name":"Sorn","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Sorn S., 39, raises pigs to sell, and lives in Pursat Province.

Because their place was proclaimed as a city, migrants from other municipalities transfer to the place to seek jobs. Because of this, it opens business opportunities, especially in food vending.\n\nMs. L. grabbed the opportunity and has applied for a loan of Php 17,000 payable in weekly installments, so that she can meet the demand of her increasing number of customers waiting for her delicious food. She is planning to buy more meat, vegetables, ingredients, soft drinks and cooking utensils to expand her business.\n\nMs. L. wanted to learn and cook new menus, too, for her customers to love.

He lives in his own home together with his wife, their two children and his granddaughter. With a great deal of work, Gaudencio managed to purchase a car. He worked many long years as a bus driver to achieve this goal. But he works with his own car now and he provides taxi services from 7 in the morning until 9 at night. He has had this schedule for the past 24 years. He is very passionate about his work. Even the medical leave he had to take following an eye operation did not deter his wish to keep working. He prefers to work instead of being bored at home. The earnings that he gains also cover the medicines his wife needs. She suffers from diabetes.

He is aged 44 years and married to Naema T., a 40-year-old lady. Both Yustinus and Naema have been living in Nekmese Village for years, since they were children. This village is situated 55 km from Kupang City, and it takes about two and a half hours' ride to get into the village from Kupang City. The road to this village is bumpy and hasn\u2019t been asphalted yet. Most of the community in this village relies on the agricultural sector to generate money to support their lives, including Yustinus and the group members of Betania IV-A. <p>\r\n\r\nIn Nekmese Village, Yustinus finances his family by farming. His marriage has been blessed with 2 children, aged 9 to 14 years; they are Bifeni and Yosafat. As a farmer, Yustinus is only able to generate income in a small amount. The income is unstable, depending on the season and crops. To generate money, Yustinus usually sells bananas and areca nut in the market. His wife also helps him to generate money by selling vegetables. The hardship that Yustinus faces in financing his family motivates him to find another alternative to support his family life. This is the reason why Yustinus is intereseted in joining TLM Cattle Fattening Program. <p>\r\n\r\nYustinus is requesting a loan amounting to IDR 3,200,000 from TLM to buy cattle to be fattened over a 12 month period. The other members of this group are also requesting loans to buy cattle to be fattened. They hope that the cattle fattening program will help them in improving their lives. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3125,"image":{"id":319686,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy cattle to be fattened","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Kupang, Nekmese","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":129,"posted_date":"2009-05-19T07:50:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":3125,"lender_count":103,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Yustinus","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Melkias","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Metusalak","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Napoleon","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Obet","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Oktovianus","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sakarias","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Stefanus","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Titus","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yulius","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-05-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"IDR","disbursal_amount":32400000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":3125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":32400000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":3125}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":1861.5,"local_amount":19300000,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T12:24:40Z","rounded_local_amount":19351971.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136755432},{"amount":1263.5,"local_amount":13100000,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-30T10:31:05Z","rounded_local_amount":13135276.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172188365}],"funded_date":"2009-05-22T13:05:40Z","paid_date":"2010-10-30T10:31:05Z","journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Michelle Wigg","image":1373520}},{"id":113584,"name":"\u0110\u1ed7 Th\u1ecb","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"V. \u0110\u1ed7 Th\u1ecb (721000685) is a 46-year-old female living in the town of M\u00ea Linh.

and her story is representative of her group and of Esperanza's Haitian and Dominican (many of whom recently emigrated to the DR from Haiti) clients generally. Her group is located in Puerto Plata, a port town with a tourism-based economy where running water (none of which is potable) and electricity are unreliable. She makes her home here in a simple structure with her longtime partner and her three children.\r\n\r\nMaria is excited to be taking her third loan with Esperanza, after having successfully repaid her previous loans. She plans to use this loan to invest in her clothing sales business by purchasing a dozen pairs of panties, a half dozen bras and a half dozen blouses in the main market in Santiago, then returning to her neighborhood to sell them to her clients at a profit. She will also use the loan to purchase a sewing machine, so that she can customize her clothes. She will use the profits to invest in her home by replacing her wood walls with concrete, purchasing a telephone, purchasing a computer for her children's education, purchasing school supplies for her children and paying tuition for herself to attend English classes.
