The beauty of this place is seen in the pretty clothing worn by the women and the men, to a small degree, when they walk down the gray main streets that make up this town with an unmatched history. Santiago de Atitl\u00e1n was one of the pressure points during the region\u2019s civil war to which many people fell victim. Of course, generations have since passed but the memory of the tragedies remains burned in the minds of the community elders. <p>\r\nAs its name suggests, the members of this group belong are of Maya Tzutujil descent and their ancestors have lived for centuries in the extreme west of Lake Atitl\u00e1n. Nowadays the Maya Tzutujil language is mainly spoken in the towns of Santiago de Atitl\u00e1n, San Pablo la Iaguna, San Juan la Iaguna and San Pedro la Iaguna. <p>\r\nLike many women of Santiago de Atitl\u00e1n, the members  of this communal bank work in the textile, embroidery and bead-based jewelry trades. <p>\r\nSome of the members work weaving typical blouses of the region, called \u201chuipiles\u201d. These women plan to invest their money in the purchase of white, blue and purples threads \u2014 the typical colors used to make huipiles. Other members weave what are known as \u201cperrajes\u201d, which have a number of uses. Usually it\u2019s used as part of an outfit and is worn as a sash across a women\u2019s shoulder as a sign of respect. Women also wrap perrajes around their heads, as in the past it was worn on this way to be a weight buffer when carrying heavy baskets. Finally, when women go to a place of worship its used to cover their heads as a sign of respect. <p>\r\nOther group members will purchase thread to embroider beautiful birds and flowers on the aforementioned blouses, which can be seen in the photo. This type of embroidery is typical for the town. It is the only town where the women embroider birds in such a majestic way. <p>\r\nFinally, some of the other members will use the loan to purchase jewelry beads to make beautiful necklaces, bracelets, rings, earrings and key chains, which are made in very innovative shapes and change with the seasons. For example, during Christmas time the women make key chains of Santa Claus, reindeer, Christmas trees and the star of Bethlehem. <p>\r\nOne can say that if he or she supports this group with its businesses he or she is also supporting the history, culture and art of Santiago de Atitl\u00e1n thanks to the work of these women who dedicate themselves to express the magic of the town through their craftsmanship.\r\n<p><b>Translated from Spanish by Marty Greenstein, Kiva Volunteer<\/b><p>\r\n<P>El banco comunal Maya Tzutujil 2 est\u00e1 conformado por mujeres oriundas de Santiago de Atitl\u00e1n. La belleza de Santiago de Atitl\u00e1n yace en los hermosos trajes que lucen las mujeres y los hombres, a menor escala, cuando caminan por los estrechos caminos gris\u00e1ceos que conforman un pueblo con una historia inigualable. Santiago de Atitl\u00e1n fue uno de los focos de tensi\u00f3n durante la \u00e9poca de la guerra civil en la regi\u00f3n de Atitl\u00e1n. Muchas personas fueron victimas de aquel conflicto. Sin embargo, las generaci\u00f3n pasan y el recuerdo de las tragedias se qued\u00f3 archivado en la mente de los sabios ancianos de la comunidad.   \r\n\r\n<P>Como su nombre lo especifica este grupo de mujeres pertenecen al grupo \u00e9tnico Maya Tzutujil. Se sabe que los Mayas Tzutujiles han vivido por siglos en el extremo sur oeste del lago Atitl\u00e1n. Actualmente los se escucha el idioma Maya Tzutujil mayormente en los pueblos de Santiago de Atitlan, San Pablo la laguna, San Juan la laguna y San Pedro la laguna. \r\n\r\n<P>Como muchas mujeres en Santiago de Atitlan las clientes que participan en este banco comunal trabajan en tejidos, bordados y la elaboraci\u00f3n de joyas hechas en base de mostacilla.\r\n\r\n<P>Un grupo de las clientes trabajan tejiendo huipiles o blusas t\u00edpicas. Ellas van a invertir su dinero en la compra de hilo blanco, celeste, morado y celeste. Estos son los colores t\u00edpicos utilizado a la hora de fabricar el huipil. Otras tejen perrajes. Un perraje es una pieza de tela multiuso. Usualmente es utilizado como parte de la indumentaria y esta sobrepuesta en el hombro de las mujeres para indicar respeto a los dem\u00e1s, tambi\u00e9n las mujeres envuelven el perraje y se lo ponen entre la cabeza y los pesados canastos que cargan sobre la cabeza para amortiguar el peso. Finalmente, cuando las mujeres van a la iglesia o al templo se cubren la cabeza con el perraje en s\u00edmbolo de respeto. \r\n\r\n<P>Otro grupo de clientas va a comprar hilo para bordar hermosas aves y flores en los huipiles, as\u00ed como se pueden ver en la foto. Este tipo de bordado es t\u00edpico de este pueblo. Es el \u00fanico pueblo en donde las mujeres bordan aves de una manera tan majestuosa. \r\n\r\n<P>Finalmente, otro grupo de clientes utiliza el cr\u00e9dito para comprar bolitas de mostacilla. Con la mostacilla ellas elaboran bellos collares, pulseras, anillos, aretes y llaveros. Los llaveros tienden a ser figuras muy innovadoras y acorde con la fecha del a\u00f1o. Por ejemplo, en la \u00e9poca de navidad las mujeres producen llaveros de Santa Claus, venados, \u00e1rboles de Navidad y estrellas fugaces. \r\n\r\n<P>Uno puede decir que si uno apoya a estas mujeres con sus negocios uno tambi\u00e9n est\u00e1 apoyando la historia, la cultura y el arte de Santiago de Atitlan debido a que estas artesanas se dedican a expresar por medio de su arte la magia de este pueblo."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2350,"image":{"id":157537,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"Purchase

Mirtha plans to invest the loan requested in buying food and pop to stock her store better, part of the loan will also be used to buy beads to finish working on some clothes she has pending.\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Sofia Burt, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":900,"image":{"id":595082,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Stock her store with various products","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-09-05T05:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":900,"lender_count":32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mirta ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-08-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":366.39},{"due_date":"2010-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":393.78},{"due_date":"2010-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":405.58},{"due_date":"2010-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":424.46},{"due_date":"2011-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":445.6},{"due_date":"2011-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":464.19}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131.9},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":141.76},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":146.01},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":152.81},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":160.41},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":167.11}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":131.9,"local_amount":366.39,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:25:47Z","rounded_local_amount":368.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172154590},{"amount":141.76,"local_amount":393.78,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T15:13:39Z","rounded_local_amount":396.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177449902},{"amount":146.01,"local_amount":405.58,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:00:39Z","rounded_local_amount":408.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182588600},{"amount":152.81,"local_amount":424.46,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T14:03:48Z","rounded_local_amount":427.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188725105},{"amount":160.41,"local_amount":445.6,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T04:41:16Z","rounded_local_amount":448.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191463201},{"amount":167.11,"local_amount":464.19,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T08:52:00Z","rounded_local_amount":467.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195886606}],"funded_date":"2010-09-16T18:58:38Z","paid_date":"2011-03-24T08:52:00Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sofia Burt","image":1306467}},{"id":232880,"name":"Daisy","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Daisy B. is from the village of Bantuanon, Lantapan, Bukidnon.

They all live in the Hamdallaye neighborhood of the city of S\u00e9gou (fourth administrative region of Mali). They became acquainted through kinship and through their sales activities at the Ch\u00e2teau de S\u00e9gou market.\r\n\r\nThe group members buy and sell \u201cpagnes wax\u201d (colorful West African fabrics), clothing, used clothing (commonly called \"yougou-yougou\" in the Bambara language), incense, and soap. In order to increase their working capital and pay cash for supplies, the group members joined Soro Yiriwaso and are on their fifth group loan. The four previous loans are fully repaid.\r\n\r\nMrs. Ramata D. has a good reputation as an incense merchant in Hamdallaye, especially with young married women. She plans to use her loan to buy two kilograms of \"Magnonkiss\u00e8ni\" (seeds of a wild plant), ten bottles of cologne, and ten tubes of quality fragrances. She buys these items wholesale at the big market in S\u00e9gou. To make incense, she soaks Magnonkiss\u00e8ni in cologne for at least a week, then adds fragrance. The resulting incense is put in bottles to be sold retail for cash and credit. She sells from her home, as an ambulant vendor, and at the Ch\u00e2teau market, primarily to women.\r\n\r\nWith this loan Mrs. Ramata D. hopes to make an average monthly profit of 45,000 CFA, which will be reinvested in the business and used for household expenses and school fees.\r\n\r\nNote:  Hinda Kon\u00e9 is not pictured because she was in

All of them are from the city of Concepci\u00f3n.\n\nSonia is a member of the Communal Bank.  In the photograph, she is the first person standing on the left-hand side wearing a yellow jacket and black cap.  She makes earrings, rings, and bracelets with macram\u00e9 (fabric that is woven into a lace-like pattern).  Sonia also makes handbags and wallets out of leather.  She has been in this trade for six years. Sonia says that her sales diminish during the winter when students go on break.  However, she says the month of September is good for her because her sales go up at that time.  Her work schedule is from 11am to 8pm.  Her merchandise is generally sold to distributors.  With this loan, Sonia will buy materials, specifically wool and leather in different colors and textures.  Her goal is to increase her business.\n\nSonia lives with her husband and her 11-year-old son.  Her dreams in general are to prosper in her business and to provide her family a better quality of life.  Sonia is very pleased with and thankful for the services provided by Fondo Esperanza, especially the kindness that is expressed by her Communal Bank group.  She says that the members are hardworking entrepreneurs who are committed to their businesses.  \n\nThe member who appears in the upper left hand corner could not attend the photo session of the communal bank due to a personal obligation that she had to resolve. It is for this reason that she was allowed to be absent during the meeting. \n\nConcepci\u00f3n is situated at the mouth of the Biob\u00edo River, one of the largest in Chile.  It is located in the southern part of the country in the Biob\u00edo region.  Concepci\u00f3n played an important role in Chilean history.  It was the site of important battles and became a major settlement, especially during the Arauco War, since it lies on the border with the Mapuche territory.  Concepci\u00f3n now experiences significant economic and demographic development.  It is considered to be one of the urban areas that has developed into a major administrative, financial, and commercial center within Chile, just behind Santiago and Valpara\u00edso.  \n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3350,"image":{"id":862314,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"to buy wool and leather.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after Tajikistan\u2019s independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n<p>\r\nIMON's History<br>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Right now, she is just keeping piglets, but Ni Putu has plans to buy sows and become a piglet seller. To raise capital, she will save from the sale of her pigs during this period. Currently, the piglets are very expensive (Rp  400,000) because it is difficult to find them. That's because people rarely maintain piglets. It was seen as a good attempt by Ni Putu.

Salve works hard to continually provide income for the family's everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nSalve operates a variety store which, in the Philippines, is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, PHP 5 worth of cooking oil or an egg. Salve earns an income by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house and her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 500 PHP in daily sales.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, Salve is requesting a PHP 20,000 loan, which she will use to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nSalve hopes to be able to expand soon, just as she dreams of being able to give her family a good future through all her hard work. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members weekly to share stories of her work and to draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners.

Vegetable cultivation is the most profitable, producing a large quantity of products that get a good price in the local market in the zone. In the future Clorinda wants to acquire more land where she can continue to produce more. This is her tenth loan with MFP and she is very content to know that she has financial support. She has always been responsible with her repayments, and is thankful to be part of a communal bank as all the members are responsible and supportive people. Clorinda is thankful that the members will be guarantors for the loan she is seeking, as it will be very useful for her business.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

His business is a colmado, a place where you can find all the ingredients to make your daily food.

He will use the profits to proviD. for his home, and to pay for his children's education.  One of his dreams is to see them become professional. \r\n\r\nThis Esperanza associate's story is representative of his group and of Esperanza's Haitian and Dominican clients (many of whom recently emigrated to the DR from Haiti). His group is located in the city of Hato Mayor, one of the country\u2019s most rural cities whose economy depends on agriculture.

She sells her livestock during the season when the fairs come to town. She is also involved in agriculture, cultivating potatoes, corn, and fava beans. She sells the products after every harvest, lasting about 6 months. So while she waits to sell her livestock she is still able to earn an income.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b><br>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

Others are engaged in the production of livestock; they purchase cattle and fatten them and reproduce them so that they can improve their breeds and sell their calves.  In addition they produce dairy products from the cows, such as fresh milk and natural yogurts and cheeses.  Other members sell dry products such as seeds, lima beans, corn, cereals and beans, among others.

They are small-scale entrepreneurs in Makeni City, who want a loan of Le 2,000,000 (or SLL 500,000 each) to enable them to improve their businesses. This is the first loan these entrepreneurs will be accessing from SMT\/Kiva. With the help of this loan, they will be able to expand their businesses; sales will thus improve and so also will their sales-to-profit-margin. With a larger profit at their disposal, they will be able to better look after themselves and their children.  <P>\r\n\r\nThe leader of this group is Fatmata K. on the left.

Since she was very young, she worked to help out her parents and thus learned everything she needed to cultivate the land and yield a good production. Every day she wakes up very early to tend to her potato and pea crops, which she previously planted with a lot of care and patience. Then, after numerous months of hard work, she hopes her efforts bear fruit and she can pick all her crops and transport them to the market, where she can sell them at a good price. This is what has transpired over the 12 years she has dedicated herself entirely to this activity. Furthermore, she says that she enjoys her work because she can continue the legacy passed down from her parents, as the land will help make headway for her family. In the future, she plans to plant larger quantities to increase her profits, which will help cover the costs of her children's education. This is her third loan cycle with Kiva partner MFP, and she is very certain this will help her increase her production. Her work with her community bank has been good, and all of the members are very responsible with their payments.

Sebab himpitan ekonomi terasa semakin berat saja, ditambah lagi harus menyekolahkan anaknya yang masih SMA serta menanggung seorang anaknya lagi yang belum bekerja. Melihat peluang dari beternak babi yang bisa menghasilkan keuntungan yang bagus maka Kadek ikut dalam program DINARI yang memberikan permodalan kepada para peternak babi di pedesaan. Pinjaman pertama dengan DINARI ini sebesar Rp.5000.000,- dengan jangka waktu 6 bulan dan pelunasan akan dilakukan pada akhir periode pinjaman. Pinjaman ini digunakan Kadek untuk membeli 4 ekor bibit babi penggemukan sebagai langkah awal dalam meningkatkan populasi serta pengembangan usahanya selain memang sudah ada induk babi di kandang miliknya. Pinjaman ini juga akan digunakan untuk membeli persediaan pakan selama 5 bulan kedepan. Dengan harga bibit per ekornya Rp.350.000,- diharapkan nantinya bisa dijual minimal Rp.1.500.000,- per ekor setelah 5 bulan pemeliharaan. Keuntungan yang dicapai per bulan diharapkan berkisar Rp.200.000,- sehingga bisa menambah penghasilan keluarganya.","en":"Ni Kadek Wiastini started farming pigs even before she got married.

She is 41 years old, and married with three school-aged children. To make a living, Josephine owns and operates a business venture in the food sector, making and selling food. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from preparing and selling cooked food for daily meals. Josephine has been engaged in her business for over a year and earns approximately 1000 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Josephine joined Kiva partner, GDMPC, to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. She is requesting a loan of 5000 PHP, which will be used to purchase raw ingredients needed to prepare food for sale. This loan will be her first from GDMPC. Josephine plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve her family's general living conditions. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three unit offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

She\u2019s also started a business of her own in partnership with her sister: selling clothes for men, women and children where she\u2019s sure she\u2019ll do very well.\r\n\r\nShe\u2019s a member of the \u201cLa Uni\u00f3n Hace la Fuerza del Palomar\u201d communal bank and this is the second MFP loan where she hopes to succeed with her communal bank which is composed of people committed to progress and which is the motivation for her to be punctual with her payments.\r\n\r\nIf Criss were to get your support, she\u2019ll use the requested money to buy several sacks of natural fertilizer to strengthen her coffee nursery and whatever\u2019s left over for her coffee plants which are in full growth phase.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":827284,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Green"],"use":"to buy sacks of fertilizer.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Chanchamayo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.05 -75.316667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-08-08T15:40:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":750,"lender_count":28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Chriss ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-07-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":750}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":750,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-17T08:12:36Z","rounded_local_amount":2053.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283201864}],"funded_date":"2011-08-08T19:02:34Z","paid_date":"2012-06-17T08:12:36Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":327203,"name":"Alnie","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Alnie is a hardworking entrepreneur who has a motorcycle transport business in the Philippines. \r\n\r\nShe is borrowing PHP 10,000 through NWTF to purchase spare parts for motorcycle maintenance.\r\n\r\nAlnie has been in this business for eight years.
