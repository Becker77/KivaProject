She has had the furniture and interior decorating businesses for about three years  (it will be three years on April 17th). She also recently opened a spa, where she offers a variety of beauty services. When she first opened the spa, she dedicated most of her time to administering it, but she quickly found that the furniture business suffered as a consequence. Today, she splits her time between the businesses: she spends about 60% of her time on interior decorating and furniture sales, and the other 40% to running the spa. She has five employees at the spa and three employees selling furniture, and says that she serves a wide spectrum of the public with each of her businesses. \r\n\r\nJacqueline is requesting a loan of 2300 soles to buy more furniture. She will buy furniture made from plastic and wood, especially entertainment centers to shelve DVDs, TVs and stereos.

The common source of their income is through farming: they till their parcel of land twice a year by planting rice and some vegetables. Furthermore, Rolando works as a carpenter while Julie Grace engages in selling barbecued food in front of their house to earn additional income. As a fruit of her patience and sacrifices, she is able to gain a net income of PHP 700 per week which they utilize to satisfy their needs and to support the schooling of their children.\r\n\r\nJulie Grace aims to improve her business but she hasn\u2019t enough capital. Fortunately, when one of the lending institutions offered their programs and services in their Barangay, Julie Grace decided to join purposely to borrow additional capital. She applied for PHP 5,000 to be used in the improvement of her business. She is so happy in joining the organization because it helps her to improve their standard of living.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":125,"image":{"id":379670,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

She has been living for 20 years in Takon A\u00efdj\u00e8do in Porto-Novo, the administrative capital of Benin. She is the wife of Marcellin Djissoukpe, a farmer, and the mother of four children who all attend school. The parents provide together for their family.\r\n<p>\r\nAblavi never went to school. 15 years ago she began to produce sodabi, a local alcoholic drink, which she sells from her home. She sells also palm oil in Ouando in Porto-Novo. She gets her supplies in the nearby villages and at Ouando market. This is her third loan from Alid\u00e9. She repaid her previous two loans on schedule. Ablavi applies for this loan to boost her business and increase her daily production, so that she can sell more.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Robert Mouris, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":411809,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To buy palm oil and produce sodabi","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BJ","country":"Benin","town":"Porto-Novo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"6.483333 2.616667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":104,"posted_date":"2009-10-24T21:00:17Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":250,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.29,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ablavi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-11-12T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":100000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2010-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2010-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2010-03-12T08:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2010-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2010-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2010-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2010-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2010-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2010-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":10000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":25,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T11:08:23Z","rounded_local_amount":10930.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103735966},{"amount":25,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T11:26:15Z","rounded_local_amount":10930.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110623477},{"amount":25,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T10:14:11Z","rounded_local_amount":10930.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118020182},{"amount":25,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T08:21:30Z","rounded_local_amount":10930.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123858675},{"amount":25,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-27T23:22:19Z","rounded_local_amount":10930.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":130494989},{"amount":24.71,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T09:41:21Z","rounded_local_amount":10930.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.29,"payment_id":136618824},{"amount":50,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:08:52Z","rounded_local_amount":21860.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151834914},{"amount":25,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2010-08-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-16T07:56:21Z","rounded_local_amount":10930.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166953769},{"amount":25,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2010-09-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T09:31:05Z","rounded_local_amount":10930.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172055471}],"funded_date":"2009-10-25T15:27:58Z","paid_date":"2010-10-15T09:31:05Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Robert Mouris","image":538858}},{"id":150758,"name":"Khasay","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Khasay M. is a responsible father of three children.

The easiest way to come to that place is to go straight ahead on Avenida del Se\u00f1or del Pueblo. The community of Cuahuixtla, which belongs to the village bank \"La Uni\u00f3n del Progreso\", is situated right behind the Apatlaco bridge. Their members are known for the punctuality of their repayments.\r\n\r\nAll the members of the village bank are active in trade and services: Mrs Ver\u00f3nica sells protective covers for blenders and washing machines,Mrs Francisca D\u00edaz prepares pickled peppers and nopal salads,Do\u00f1a Margarita sells via catalog and also sells bu\u00f1uelos,Nohemi is a manager with the cosmetics company Mary Kay and also sells via catalog,Flor sells via catalog and some groceries when there are bargains in the store where she works,Carlos, Genoveva and Magdalena operate public transport minibuses,Sof\u00eda and Erika sell via catalog,Erick sells nutrition products from Herbalife, and finallyLeticia B. B. sells via catalog; a detailed account of her story follows.\r\n\r\nLeticia initially was a member of a loan group to which she and her mother were invited. The group was created, but had problems with the repayments. There was some fighting, but finally the loan was repaid. Leticia waited for two months and then informed the microfinance institution that she wanted to set up a new group with other members. This group was created and is now in its third loan cycle. Leticia's share of the loan amounts to 8,000 pesos, which she will invest in her store where she has a highly diversified inventory: sportswear, perfume, creams, lingerie, etc. She is married and the mother of two sons: one is in fourth grade and the other is four months old.\r\n\r\nShe told us that when she married, she suffered a lot. The reason is that she had been working since she was very young and she liked having her own money. However, when she married, everything became different, because her husband would not let her continue selling. There was a time when her husband was in the United States. She grasped the opportunity to open a store and sold anything she could. When her husband informed her that he was about to come home, she got rid of her entire inventory, so that he shouldn't notice anything. But soon he learnt the truth and had a fight with her. Finally, they talked about it and he understood that her contribution might help him to support his sons and give them everything they were entitled to.\r\n\r\nFinally Leticia thanked our microfinance institution for its support and continued lending. She was able to continue her business, because at times she did not have the necessary resources to restock her store. She used the loans to reach her goal and be able to keep selling her merchandise. She is grateful to Kiva to trust our microfinance institution and to give the lenders the opportunity to get to know the institution and the entrepreneurs through this interview and this picture.<br

In the evenings she sells chicken from a mobile stall, which she sets up along the central road in Santa Ana.  She really enjoys serving her customers and making new friends.\r\n\r\nFor the time being, she is saving all of her income because she wants to make upgrades to expand her home.

Willyn enjoys this kind of job \u2013 moreover it enhances and develops her selling skills.\r\nWillyn joined Kiva partner, GDMPC, earlier this year. Her loan application for 4,000 PHP has been approved. With this amount, Willyn can now order additional Avon products to sell in her neighborhood and in neighboring communities. She hopes to have more revenue so she can start ordering larger numbers of the most demanded items.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":100,"image":{"id":826949,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics

name is Bertha Luis M., and I am a 35-year-old native of Matola, Maputo province. I grew up under the care of my parents; however, the family\u2019s financial situation offered me few schooling opportunities. In 2001 I began working in a stand at kilometer 16. Since 2004 I have come to assume the full administrative duties of my family\u2019s business, and I have also come to own my own commercial establishment. At the start of 2006, with the help of some female colleagues at the market, I met Hluvuku-Adsema and solicited information about the conditions of access to credit for the expansion of my business. Right now my business requires greater capital to respond to the ever-growing services of preparing meals. With this loan I intend to reinforce product stock, thus reducing the number of trips to the city of Maputo and diversifying my client\u2019s menus. \r\n<p>Bertha\u2019s business\u2019 impact on the community is great because beyond providing employment for herself and her niece she prepares meal for more than 100 people who work in close proximity to her establishment. <p> <b>Translated from Portuguese by Marco Alves, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nBertha Luis M. de 35 anos de idade, natural de Matola, prov\u00edncia do Maputo,  cresceu sob a responsabilidade dos pais, a situa\u00e7\u00e3o financeira da fam\u00edlia n\u00e3o lhe ofereceu  oportunidades para estudar.

He was born circa 1972 in Tousseguela, one of the towns in the Kolondi\u00e8ba prefecture, third administrative region of Mali. He lives with his spouses and their children in Kadiolo, a neighborhood in Sikasso. He's been a merchant for 4 years, and mostly sells cereals and, occasionally, small items. Experienced thanks to his years in this business, he runs it with much success. He's seeking his second loan from Kiva's partner, the microfinance organization Soro Yiriwaso. The first loan was repaid without problems.\r\n<p>\r\nWith this loan, he intends to buy 500 kg of corn, 500 kg or sorghum, and other items. He gets his supplies in the villages surrounding Kadiola, and sells for cash and on credit, both retail and wholesale, to a clientele comprising women and men. Often, he sells cereals on order. He expects to turn an average monthly profit of XOF 40'000 (ca US$ 80), to be used in part to bolster his working capital. The other part will be put aside, because he wants to build a home to live in Sikasso city.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Patrick Stadelmann, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":303353,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"To buy 500 kg of corn, 500 kg or sorghum, and other items","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sikasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.316667 -5.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2009-05-01T07:00:41Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":475,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Seydou ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-03-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":225000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":28125},{"due_date":"2009-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":28125},{"due_date":"2009-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":28125},{"due_date":"2009-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":28125},{"due_date":"2009-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":28125},{"due_date":"2009-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":28125},{"due_date":"2009-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":28125},{"due_date":"2009-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":28125}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.37},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.37},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.37},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.37},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.37},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.37},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.37},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.41}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":118.75,"local_amount":56250,"processed_date":"2009-05-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:42:59Z","rounded_local_amount":58245.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44621224},{"amount":59.38,"local_amount":28125,"processed_date":"2009-06-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:25:52Z","rounded_local_amount":29122.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53020186},{"amount":59.38,"local_amount":28125,"processed_date":"2009-07-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T19:22:52Z","rounded_local_amount":29122.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63242941},{"amount":59.34,"local_amount":28125,"processed_date":"2009-08-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T22:45:48Z","rounded_local_amount":29122.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73678663},{"amount":59.37,"local_amount":28125,"processed_date":"2009-09-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T03:58:52Z","rounded_local_amount":29122.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87112556},{"amount":59.37,"local_amount":28125,"processed_date":"2009-10-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T07:13:39Z","rounded_local_amount":29122.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97028141},{"amount":59.41,"local_amount":28125,"processed_date":"2009-11-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:57:32Z","rounded_local_amount":29122.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103873516}],"funded_date":"2009-05-16T17:52:46Z","paid_date":"2009-12-15T14:57:32Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Patrick Stadelmann","image":1374498}},{"id":105584,"name":"Kele Oyella Agnes Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. O.

Jason launched Bay Area Battle Tactics, a local competition for singers, dancers, and DJs that can help them gain recognition beyond the San Francisco Bay Area. Jason taught himself graphic design and created his own website to advertise the company, and he recruited friends in the entertainment industry to volunteer and get the project off the ground. \r\n\r\nWith a $6,000 loan, Jason can create and distribute flyers and posters, hold auditions, purchase DJ and sound equipment, and hire part-time employees. He hopes that his business will also help reduce inner-city gang violence and unify diverse communities by providing a creative outlet for local youth through music, song, and dance.\r\n\r\nVisit

They live in the village of Sime, which is located in the District of P\u00edtipo, located 30 minutes away from the city of Chiclayo.\r\n<p>\r\nFor eight years, she has been in the business of selling basic necessities (rice, sugar, oil, etc.), groceries, and vegetables from her home.

Therefore, she is seeking a loan of 1000 soles from our Institution.

Flor knows that investing in her children\u2019s education is a job that requires much effort.  \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva

Together they live in a small village located in the beautiful rainforest town of Ayacucho where they have their own house on a wood foundation. Eudosia has always placed a high priority on the quality of her agricultural products. She grows cocoa beans and stays busy with this responsibility and frequently tries out new methods of agriculture. From a young age, her parents offered her a small piece of land where she could experiment and grow products. Now thanks to the help of her husband, she now gets a lot out of her land, whereas before she could not realistically grow enough to cover the needs of her family. Currently, she has a bigger piece of land and has improved her sales from the past. Eudosia recognizes that she has been given the first step toward achieving success and she aspires to expand her cocoa bean sales to strategic places that will earn her more profits. In general, she sells her products by the bunch in the central market of her town. For the most part, she works with her husband, but during the sowing and harvesting season, she hires laborers to help with the work. This is her fourth loan with MFP and she promises that she will responsibly make all of her payments. Moreover, she appreciates the partnership with the community bank that is there for all community members. Eudosia plans to invest her money in the purchase of more agricultural land with the intent to increase her production.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Brittany Heyd, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":540006,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Purchase more agricultural land ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-05-17T15:40:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Eudosia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-04-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":375}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":375,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T15:15:19Z","rounded_local_amount":1064.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177449427}],"funded_date":"2010-05-17T22:08:17Z","paid_date":"2010-11-15T15:15:19Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Brittany Thatcher","image":null}},{"id":204766,"name":"Luchando Con Esperanza  1,2 Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Yesenia is the coordinator of her group Luchando Con Esperanza (Fighting with Hope), and her story is representative of her group and of Esperanza's Haitian and Dominican (many of whom recently emigrated to the DR from Haiti) clients generally.

They both have a son and live in their own home. For many years now she has been selling bread. She buys it wholesale to later sell it individually in the area where she lives.To date, she wakes up at four in the morning to get enough bread to resell. This job is profitable since there are no other bakeries nearby and many customers are not able to go very far to buy this product. She feels happy and relieved for having her job because it keeps her busy and she can offer her family a good quality of life.

Rogelio, as a newly recognized member of Paglaum MPC under the Medal Pangnegosyo 2 Program, is now requesting 5,000 PHP as his first loan, which will be used for additional capital for his photocopying business. He plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of his family especially in meeting their basic needs, savings for future use, loan repayments and possible business expansions.\r\n\r\n About PMPC:\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao.

This community is located in a mountainous area and is close to the country's northern border.  The main business activities of this area are livestock raising and farming, especially basic grains, sugarcane and oranges.\r\n\r\nFelipe has been farming for several years and this is the way in which he makes income for his family.  He is very happy because his business has grown significantly.  The neighbors in his community have supported him a lot and now he is capable of getting ahead.\r\n\r\nFelipe hopes to receive a micro-loan for 600,000 colones to buy fertilizers and fungicides in order to prepare his soil for sowing tubers.  He knows that the acquisition of more supplies is a great sacrifice and demands more work.  However, his wish to become a successful micro-businessman and improve his family's living conditions motivates him to make progress with a lot of care and commitment.\r\n\r\nFelipe is a member of the Manantial de Santa Fe Community Credit Company, one of EDESA's 150 member organizations in Costa Rica.

They were sold directly to clients and in part sold in markets. As raw materials were scarce (160 kg. Aluminium), he  produced in small numbers (45 cooking batteries per  month). As aluminium steel cost a lot (3 somoni per 1 kg.), Ayubjon did not have enough capital for wholesale purchase of raw materials. Receiving the first loan, he bought up raw materials from different building materials sales. Ayubjon has increased the volume of manufacture, and his clients have already started to order. Step by step he now has the opportunity of wholesale purchase of raw materials. Ayubjon has put all his profits into active capital and gradually has increased the volume of production. To output cooking batteries he has added two more kinds of production.  Now there are about 2.5 tons of raw material and his factory shop works without days off. The basic change to his business is that Ayubjon can buy raw material in large amounts and plans to increase the range of goods to  create additional profits.

She is a divorced woman and mother of one kid. Currently the child is in junior high school. Stella enjoys selling, with much experience in customer care. She has been selling bananas for five years to support her family. She treks to farming communities to buy her stock of bananas from the farmers. This saves her from middlemen who buy from the farmers and resell to her at a higher price. She wants to use the loan to buy bananas in bulk to meet the daily demands of her customers who travel from far and near to buy from her.

Little by little, and with her sons, they told themselves that if they could produce their own pictures, both the painting as well as the frame, they could generate a greater profit.\r\n\r\nToday, Elena does not only count on her studio where she makes these pictures, she is also the proprieter of four locations at the central market in the capity city where she sells and exhibits paintings.

This is 26-year-old Jeniffer N. from Mwanza. She is married with two children, 1 and 8 years old. Jeniffer has been running a clothes business since 2008, selling used clothes. Second-hand clothes journey across the oceans from America and Europe, and are then washed, ironed and sold in bulk by wholesalers in Tanzania to retailers who then re-wash and re-iron them for sale on the streets and in the surrounding towns and villages. These clothes are becoming increasingly popular, especially amongst the younger generation, because of their low cost, and the general appeal of anything modern. <P>\r\n\r\nJeniffer works at the business for 12 hours per day, 6 days per week and is assisted by one employee. Jeniffer currently earns about 200 USD from her business. She is requesting a loan of 400 USD in order to purchase more used clothes and re-sell them to her customers. In the future, she plans to open another business. Jeniffer thanks you for your support!\r\n\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing.

This group is located in the town of Barahunda, an hour away from the city of Tierra Blanca in the state of VeraC..  It is comprised of 13 people and this is their third loan from Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad.\r\n\r\nThe leader of the group is Maricela T.

She has a small business of her own called \"New Isabel\" where she sells men's and women's clothing, shoes, and jewelry (bracelets, rings, and necklaces adorned with decorative materials).  She needs her loan in order to purchase more clothing and fill her shop so that she is able to earn more money and grow her business little by little.  She hopes to increase the size of her shop in the future and enable her children to continue their studies.  Ms. Maricela is grateful to FRAC for bringing this program that allows for having a higher quality of life to the community.\r\n\r\nMs. Josefa C.

She is a single mother and a saleswoman.  She has a daughter, 10 years old, who studies in the local school.  This woman has always been a guarantor for her sister who is also a client of Ceprodel Telica.  She has had her store for more than 9 years, beginning with the help that her mother-in-law, her ex-husband's mother, gave her.

The fields for sowing, which Modesto obtained with much effort, are the principal means of support for the whole family. Modesto dedicates himself to working the fields where he has cocoa, coffee, plantains and barbasco root plants.

He has been doing this for 15 years and what he considers the most difficult is transporting the sacs of his crops, since they are very heavy and it is very tiring. In the future he hopes to buy more land to increase his cultivation. This is his second loan with MFP. He knows that it will be very beneficial for the development of his work.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

After dehydration, the goods can be stored, packaged and shipped much more efficiently and obviously brings higher prices. His products are sold around Moldova and are bought by wholesalers as well. \r\nThe scale of the operation has really grown lately, now having reached a level of production of 300 kilograms of fruit or vegetables per shift. The process of cleaning, de-seeding, and drying requires about a dozen workers per shift for this volume (these workers are all women from a local village), so his company currently employs 25 people. Gheorghe now needs a short term loan to fund the purchase of the last harvest of plums to fill a large order. His business is an ambitious one; the kind that holds much promise for helping Moldova develop into the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1875,"image":{"id":9712,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"loan to fund the purchase of the last harvest of plums to fill a large order","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MD","country":"Moldova","town":"Sipoteni","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"46.9425 28.456389","type":"point"}},"partner_id":17,"posted_date":"2006-12-30T18:46:49Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1875,"lender_count":26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gheorghe","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-01-14T22:45:07Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1875,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":1875,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":234.38},{"due_date":"2007-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":234.38},{"due_date":"2007-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":234.38},{"due_date":"2007-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":234.38},{"due_date":"2007-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":234.38},{"due_date":"2007-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":234.38},{"due_date":"2007-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":234.38},{"due_date":"2007-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":234.34}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":234.38},{"due_date":"2007-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":234.38},{"due_date":"2007-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":234.38},{"due_date":"2007-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":234.38},{"due_date":"2007-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":234.38},{"due_date":"2007-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":234.38},{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":234.38},{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":234.34}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":235,"local_amount":235,"processed_date":"2007-02-04T08:46:08Z","settlement_date":"2007-09-04T20:29:12Z","rounded_local_amount":235,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":6508},{"amount":235,"local_amount":235,"processed_date":"2007-03-04T10:35:19Z","settlement_date":"2007-09-04T20:29:12Z","rounded_local_amount":235,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9350},{"amount":470,"local_amount":470,"processed_date":"2007-05-04T09:26:02Z","settlement_date":"2007-09-04T20:29:12Z","rounded_local_amount":470,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":15133},{"amount":235,"local_amount":235,"processed_date":"2007-06-04T09:16:02Z","settlement_date":"2007-09-04T20:29:12Z","rounded_local_amount":235,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20134},{"amount":235,"local_amount":235,"processed_date":"2007-07-04T09:16:12Z","settlement_date":"2007-09-04T20:29:12Z","rounded_local_amount":235,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":28830},{"amount":235,"local_amount":235,"processed_date":"2007-08-04T09:16:11Z","settlement_date":"2007-09-04T20:29:12Z","rounded_local_amount":235,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":38793},{"amount":230,"local_amount":230,"processed_date":"2007-09-04T09:16:19Z","settlement_date":"2007-09-04T20:29:12Z","rounded_local_amount":230,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":50382}],"funded_date":"2006-12-31T22:45:07Z","paid_date":"2007-09-04T09:16:19Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":7288,"name":"Martin","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"History of the Client: Mr. Mart\u00edn P.

They named their group Lanaya. They are local entrepreneurs in the town of Kabala. This is the fourth time they've received a Kiva loan through SMT. Previously, each one in the group received a loan of Le 600,000.00. That loan created meaningful impacts in the lives of these people. They were able to use the proceeds to pay for their children's school fees in case things were difficult for their husbands. They could also add to the daily allowances that their husband's give them for food. Today, they are requesting a loan of Le 700,000.00 each to buy more goods to add to their businesses. <p>\r\nAdama B. (right) is the leader of the group. She is forty-two years of age. She was born in Kabala and she is married with five children. Two of her children are in secondary school and the other two are in primary levels. The fifth is currently learning a trade. Her husband is the tribal head for the Fullas in Kabala. Amongst other activities, he arbitrates amongst the Fullas. Adama has been selling gara lappers (locally dyed clothes, often with fabricated designs) for the past seven years now. <p>\r\nWith this new loan, Adama will expand on her business by buying about 4 \"pieces\" of white cotton (thirty yards make a piece). She will buy an additional number of inks, caustic soda and powder. She will also be able to pay workers who design the clothes. A piece of white cotton costs her Le 120,000 in Freetown, where she often sends someone to buy her the materials she needs. Prices for the inks vary depending on the color, ranging from Le 40,000 to Le 60,000. She sells the gara clothes (gara lapper) between Le 25,000 and Le 30,000.

Julieta repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from PMPC, which she used to purchase supplies,  including nails and lumber. Julieta is requesting a new loan of 8,000 PHP, which she will use to invest in expanding the business. This will be her fourth loan from PMPC.

For the past 20 years she has been a farmer and cattle rancher.  Her main crops are wheat, potato, barley, peas and corn but she also raises cattle, especially bulls for sale at the livestock fairs.  When harvest time arrrives, wholesale merchants come looking for her and they buy her products by the truckload.  Carmen prefers this because she doesn't have to spend on transportation costs, although she admits that ther profits are lower this way, than selling directly in the market.  However, this way has allowed her and her husband to continue working because they have secured regular customers that they can count on, they can support their family and afford to pay for the education of their children.  This is her ninth loan with MFP.  She is a person who is well aware of the need to work cooperatively in her communal bank so she is well-liked by her fellow members.

They are parents of six children (one daughter and five sons, one of whom passed away). All of their children are studying, one of whom is already working in a commercial house. <p>\r\nFlorencia began selling cow milk thirty-five years ago and started this activity as a child learning from her parents. After marrying and becoming independent from her parents, together with her husband, they bought their own milking cows and continued working in this field since she was well-experienced with this activity. With much strength and perseverance, they have progressed and been able to increase their stock of cows in order to produce and sell more milk. Thanks to the profit they have gained, they have been able to construct a commercial salon on their own land. They have been able to rent out the salon to use as an extra source of income. <p>\r\nHer greatest dream is for her children to finish their studies and become professionals in the future.

Her business is one of the best in town with good quality products and several locations. \r\n\r\nMavludakhon currently has one stall at the market. Eventually, Mavludakhon would like to open a store in a permanent facility. Mavludakhon has requested a loan of 2000 Somoni (600 USD) to help purchase new inventory of autumn clothing for teenagers. She promises to repay the loan within 8 months. She will be able to help many teenagers keep warm and dry through the rainy autumn months and hopes to make a good profit by having the right inventory in stock to meet demand as the season changes."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":201953,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"Purchasing new clothing for teenagers for re-sale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Tursunzade","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"38.5 68.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":100,"posted_date":"2008-09-11T15:10:30Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":600,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mavludakhon","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-09-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2008-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2008-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":75,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2008-10-11T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-15T07:11:58Z","rounded_local_amount":256.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356317},{"amount":150,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2008-12-25T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-15T23:43:21Z","rounded_local_amount":512.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9943556},{"amount":75,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-01-25T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T13:13:09Z","rounded_local_amount":256.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":10220622},{"amount":75,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-02-25T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T09:24:24Z","rounded_local_amount":256.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20409550},{"amount":75,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-03-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T19:38:10Z","rounded_local_amount":256.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27102581},{"amount":75,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-04-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T20:38:04Z","rounded_local_amount":256.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35996805},{"amount":75,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-05-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T00:10:09Z","rounded_local_amount":256.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44579618}],"funded_date":"2008-09-11T16:42:51Z","paid_date":"2009-06-16T00:10:09Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":68766,"name":"Marcia Fajardo","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Inici\u00f3 su negocio como una mini pulper\u00eda vendiendo cosas peque\u00f1as de alimentos, con cr\u00e9ditos que ADIM le ha otorgado ella empez\u00f3 a vender de todo tipo de productos alimenticios, en un cr\u00e9dito de mayor monto invirti\u00f3 en ropa menor, tarjetas de tel\u00e9fono, gas butano para uso domiciliar, etc. Actualmente est\u00e1 consolidando su negocio y quiere ampliarlo con una peque\u00f1a soda ubicada en el parque de la misma localidad. \r\n\r\nElla vive con su esposo y sus hijos pero quienes le apoyan directamente en el negocio son sus dos hijas que estudian y trabajan en el negocio.

This is 27 year old Grace M. A. from Kyela. She is married with 3 children, between the ages of 2 and 9. Additionally, she is responsible for supporting two dependents because their parents are too poor to care for them. Grace has been running a cereals (maize, rice, wheat etc.) business since 1998. A typical maize business is a stand on the side of the road where maize is often piled high in baskets.  Customers can scrutinize the quality of the product before they purchase it and can specify the exact amount that they would like to purchase. Maize is very important to the Tanzanian culture as it is used to make a staple dish called ugali, which is made solely of maize, flour and water.  Grace works at the business for 9 - 12 hours per day, 6 days per week and is assisted by her husband. Grace currently earns about 300USD a month from her business. She is requesting a loan of 675USD in order to buy more maize, wheat, a mallet and beans in bulk. In the future, she plans to increase the stock. Grace thanks you for your support!\r\n\r\n\r\nABOUT SELFINA:\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":303416,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To buy more maize, wheat, a mallet and beans in bulk.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Kyela","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-9.583333 33.85","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-04-14T20:20:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":700,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Grace M.

(0) is a 84-year-old woman living in the town of Vaovai.  She is widowed and has 10 adult -aged children.  To make a living, Tuulima owns & operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising crops.  While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from planting & harvesting taro for sale.  Tuulima has been engaged in this business for over 3 years and earns approximately 350 WST a month from these activities.\n\nIn 2005, Tuulima joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve  her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Tuulima has successfully repaid a previous loan of 1250 WST from SPBD.  This previous loan was used to purchase general farm supplies & equipment.  Tuulima is now requesting a new loan of 1000 WST which will be used to rent land to raise additional crops.  The loan will be the 5th loan taken out by the borrower from SPBD.  Tuulima plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business  to improve\/expand the borrower's business.\n\nAbout SPBD:\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.\n\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from selling a variety of different products in the local community. Ritchel has been engaged in her business for over 3 years and earns approximately 4,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2006, Ritchel joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Ritchel is requesting a new loan of 20,000 PHP, which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This loan will be the sixth loan taken out by Ritchel from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n<p>\r\nAbout GDMPC\r\n<p>\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.

Rosa Luz also makes a delicious chilled juice from the fruit of the maracuya (passion fruit) tree in her backyard which is very popular with locals during the hot afternoons.  \r\n\r\nRosa Luz is requesting a loan to restock her store and to help pay for day laborers who will assist her with the yucca harvest.  She appreciates and thanks you for the loan and promises to pay the monthly payments on time.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":466391,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

She is 42 years old and married. Lilia is the group leader of a two-member group loan offered by PMPC. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nTo make a living, Lilia owns and operates a general store. She has been engaged in her business for over six years and earns approximately $163 a month from this activity. Her husband is a barber. \r\n\r\nIn 2008, Lilia joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan from PMPC. Lilia is requesting a new loan of 15,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional inventory and as working capital. This will be her 5th loan from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC: \r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model. \r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She earns her living by operating two business ventures:  Resohan\/chainsaw and a charcoal business. Her husband Renaldo M., who is 48 years old, works as a Resohan to earn his living, and also helps in his wife's business activities. They have five children who are 18 to 26 years old. \r\n\r\nNenita joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2003 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past fourteen loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Nenita has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 19,000 PHP helped her earn a monthly profit of approximately $237, raising the family's standard of living. \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 15th cycle loan, she is borrowing 29,500 PHP, which she intends to use to purchase additional wood so that she can continue to save up for the future of her business and for her family's welfare. Nenita M. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.\r\n\r\nHelp NWTF continue its mission to help the poorest in the Philippines by clicking  the link to the  NWTF Kiva lending team  on Kiva.org to join our

She is 60 years old, married, and has one adult child. Elizabeth is the leader of a three-member loan group sponsored by PMPC. Although each member receives an individual loan, they are all responsible for repaying the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is Elizabeth P.\u2019s Group. \r\n\r\nTo make a living, Elizabeth buys and sells vegetables. She has been engaged in this business for six years and earns approximately 5000 PHP a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, she joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5000 from PMPC. She is now requesting a loan of 7,000 PHP which will be used to purchase more vegetables to sell. This will be Elizabeth's second loan from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve her family's living standards. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout PMPC: \r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders. \r\nAbout Group Loans\r\nIn a group loan, each member of the group receives an individual loan but is part of a group of individuals bound by a group guarantee. Under this arrangement, each member of the group supports one another and is responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She would make her sales in the evenings and gradually acquired customers.  She currently continues selling juices maD. from regional fruits and, in the evenings, she sells 'salchipapas' and other food such as fried chicken and 'salchipan' as well as soft drinks and soda.\r\n\r\nBetty will use this loan for 2,500 soles to buy products and ingredients wholesale.  In this way, she will reduce her costs.  She will buy potatoes by the sack, oil by the gallon, and herbs and spices.

After completing his studies, he began working in his uncle\u2019s garage.  Since then, people have come to know him as a hard worker.  From there, he set up his own garage and began to work independently and make profits.  Now he has so much work that he doesn\u2019t have enough time to repair his customers\u2019 motorcycles.

Her primary sources of income are milk selling, poultry farming, and some personal business that she does to supplement her meager income. Deciding to practice Poultry farming for Alice was not difficult. Her parents kept poultry. For the past five years, Alice has been earning a decent income from poultry farming. However, the demand is overwhelming and she wants to increase her poultry, but the biggest challenge is lack of funds. \n\nShe is seeking a loan to purchase additional poultry. Poultry farming has become one of the most important aspects of agriculture in Kenya because it creates business opportunity for entrepreneurs and it\u2019s a kind of business that can never dry up. Poultry farming is a less strenuous activity that is profitable. If taken seriously, poultry farming has the potential of being a big business because the demand for poultry products is always high. With your loan, Alice is going to make more income that will enable her to take care of her family's expenses. As the times keep getting harder, Alice is doing all she can do to ensure that her family's basic needs are met. \nYou can be part of Alice life.

Hal ini sesuai dengan pendidikannya yang lulusan Sekolah Tehnik Mesin. Saat ini ia tinggal bersama istri dan anaknya lelaki yang juga membantunya dalam menjalani usaha ini. Usahanya berkembang setelah ia memutuskan untuk menjual tempat tinggalnya yang lama dan berpindah ke lokasi baru yang tempatnya sangat strategis yakni di penggir jalan utama yang menghubungkan Denpasar dan Gilimanuk. Karena merupakan jalan utama, banyak kendaraan yang melintas di tempat usahanya. Seringkali Herman merasa kewalahan karena usahanya masih kecil dan tidak bisa melayani kebutuhan pelanggan dengan baik. Untuk mengatasi hal itu, Herman membutuhkan dana sebesar Rp. 5.000.000.- untuk mengembangkan usahanya. Dana itu akan dipergunakan untuk membeli aneka jenis dan ukuran ban serta sebuah dongkrak untuk mengangkat mobil yang besar. Herman optimis usahanya akan berkembang dengan baik, karena ia percaya dengan layanan yang baik kepada pelanggan, mereka akan puas dan akan datang kembali ke bengkelnya dengan lebih banyak pelanggan baru.\n\n","en":"Herman is in the vehicle service repair business buying, selling and installing tires for cars and motor cycles. This is in line with his education as Engine Technical school graduate. Today he stays with wife and son, who also helps him in running the business. The business grew after he decided to sell his living quarters, and move to a new very strategic location on the side of main road between Denpasar and Gilimanuk. Since it is on the main road, many vehicles pass through his business. Many times Herman felt overloaded, since his business is still small and could not give enough service. To solve it, Herman needs capital for Rp. 5,000,000.- (translator's note: 1US$ fluctuates between Rp 10,000-12,000) to expand his business. That funds would be used to buy several assortments of size and type\/brand of tires, and also equipment to lift large cars. Herman is optismic that his business could expand well, since he is confident about his good service to his clients, and they would be satisfied and would return to his shop with more new clients.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Indonesian by Gwan Ang, Kiva

To make a living, Nora owns & operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising crops.  While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from planting & harvesting bananas for sale.  Nora has been engaged in this business for over 8 years and earns approximately 600 WST a month from these activities.\n\nIn 2007, Nora joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve  her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Nora has successfully repaid a previous loan of 1250 WST from SPBD.  This previous loan was used to purchase young crops to raise.  Nora is now requesting a new loan of 2000 WST which will be used to purchase additional seeds, seedlings & young crops to raise.  The loan will be the 3rd loan taken out by the borrower from SPBD.  Nora plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business  to improve\/expand the borrower's business.\n\nAbout SPBD:\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.\n\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She is 20 years old and a member of the LAS 5 ESTRELLAS (5 STARS) communal bank.  She is single and has finished training as a technical nurse but has never practiced her profession because each job she was offered was very poorly paid.  Because of this, she decided to create her own business starting with the sales of natural products.  She buys and sells natural products both that she stocks and has on hand and via catalogue.  With her first 300 sol loan she bought clothing for gentlemen, ladies and children which she sold among her friends and family.  With this 1000 sol loan she will buy natural products which are on sale to add to her stock and will also buy other products for which she already has orders pending.  She hopes to increase her profits so that they will be enough to cover her personal expenses.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":410259,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Natural Medicines","sector":"Health","themes":null,"use":"To buy natural products.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Trujillo - La Libertad","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.115994 -79.02998","type":"point"}},"partner_id":72,"posted_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:54Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Liliams Evelyn ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-10-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2009-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2010-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2010-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2010-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2010-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":166.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.34},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.34},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:43:08Z","rounded_local_amount":167.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103835796},{"amount":58.22,"local_amount":166.34,"processed_date":"2009-12-17T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T15:07:14Z","rounded_local_amount":166.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110727561},{"amount":58.33,"local_amount":166.67,"processed_date":"2010-01-17T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:05:52Z","rounded_local_amount":166.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118117931},{"amount":58.34,"local_amount":166.67,"processed_date":"2010-02-17T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:44:04Z","rounded_local_amount":166.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123953658},{"amount":58.33,"local_amount":166.67,"processed_date":"2010-03-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-23T07:54:35Z","rounded_local_amount":166.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128986825},{"amount":58.33,"local_amount":166.65,"processed_date":"2010-04-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-02T07:56:20Z","rounded_local_amount":166.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136712978}],"funded_date":"2009-11-01T13:19:09Z","paid_date":"2010-06-02T07:56:20Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":150838,"name":"Mariam","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mariam is a 49-year-old woman who lives in Beirut, the capital of Lebanon, with her husband and their three children.

She sells her merchandise at home and offers her customers warm service and good prices.  She serves her customers in the mornings and her mom helps her during the afternoons.  Since she has been working, her clientele has been increasing and the majority of her customers are from her own neighborhood. \r\n\r\nKatherine is asking for a loan so she can buy merchandise to offer during the Christmas season.

It is in the city of Portoviejo in the province of Manab\u00ed, where we can enjoy beautiful beaches all year.  She has been an active member for three cycles.  \r\n\r\nShe and her husband started a retread business, and they have had it for three years.  Her husband travels to other cities to buy the used tires.  He buys an average of about 30 tires a week.  Then they retread the tires and sell them.  They sell approximately 100 tires a month, which they distribute between Portoviejo and Quito.  A cousin sells them in Quito.  \r\n\r\nKeeping the business solid has not been easy for Ketty.  Thanks to the loans received from the Espoir Foundation they have kept it afloat.  She hopes to continue with this business, which is her daily support.  She will use the loan she is requesting to buy more used tires to retread.  She will increase her business and have sufficient stock to offer her customers.\r\n\r\nHer dream is to be able to see her children\u2019s dreams come true.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":495576,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Buy used tires to retread and increase her business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Portoviejo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2010-02-25T15:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":675,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ketty Beatriz","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-02-10T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":660,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66},{"due_date":"2010-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":66},{"due_date":"2010-03-29T07:00:00Z","amount":66},{"due_date":"2010-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":66},{"due_date":"2010-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":66},{"due_date":"2010-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":66},{"due_date":"2010-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":66},{"due_date":"2010-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":66},{"due_date":"2010-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":66},{"due_date":"2010-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":66}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.5},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.5},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.5},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.5},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.5},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.5},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.5},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.5},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.5},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":67.5,"local_amount":66,"processed_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:00:13Z","rounded_local_amount":67.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128946471},{"amount":67.5,"local_amount":66,"processed_date":"2010-03-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:00:31Z","rounded_local_amount":67.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128946472},{"amount":67.5,"local_amount":66,"processed_date":"2010-03-29T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:00:49Z","rounded_local_amount":67.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128946473},{"amount":102.17,"local_amount":99.9,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:18:39Z","rounded_local_amount":102.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136674744},{"amount":167.83,"local_amount":164.1,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:17:05Z","rounded_local_amount":167.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144708905},{"amount":135,"local_amount":132,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:47:09Z","rounded_local_amount":135,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151892202},{"amount":67.5,"local_amount":66,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:10:24Z","rounded_local_amount":67.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159632612}],"funded_date":"2010-02-25T16:23:06Z","paid_date":"2010-08-15T11:10:24Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ginny Kalish"}}]}
