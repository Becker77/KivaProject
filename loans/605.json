It is known for its rich pre-colonial culture and for its crafts renowned at the national and international level. This is where the famous straw sombreros originate.\r\n\r\nThis group of people decided to come together to from a communal bank and so to have access to loans to improve their small businesses. They have various business types, including, commerce, services, food sales, and other activities. \r\n\r\nHere we meet Mrs. Mariana del Jesus M..

Every day Suarti is busy with raising the pigs in a very simple stable.  Suarti business is growing, and this is not irrespective of Dinari's role, which has created the foundation for the business, including giving a loan of Rp. 1,400,000, used by Suarti to buy one sow which is ready to breed.  Now Suarti no longer needs to buy piglits for raising, because Suarti can provide piglets for her neighbors.  Many advantages are obtained by Mrs. Suarti from raising pigs, including earning enough to support her family, while the pig manure can be used as fertilizer in the vegetable garden.\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Indonesian by Andrew Goss, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nNi Ketut Suarti sudah mencoba beberapa jenis usaha yang bisa mendatangkan keuntungan yang besar untuk membantu meringankan beban suaminya .Tetapi hanya usaha  beternak babi yang merupakan usaha yang lebih  menjanjikan.

Usaha Suarti semakin berkembang , hal ini tak terlepas  dari peranan Dinari yang ikut memberikan pembinaan tentang usaha disamping juga memberikan pinjaman modal Rp. 1.400.000.- , yang oleh Suarti di pergunakan untuk membeli 1 ekor induk babi yang sudah siap untuk di kawinkan. Kini Suarti tak perlu lagi membeli bibit untuk di pelihara sendiri bahkan Suarti sudah bisa menyediakan bibit bagi tetangganya.  Banyak manfaat yang di peroleh Bu Suarti dari beternak babi ,di samping hasilnya yang cukup untuk kebutuhan keluarga, kotoran babi bisa diolah menjadi pupuk kandang yang berguna untuk kebun sayurnya."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":68918,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy a breeding sow ready to birth piglets - Membeli induk babi yang sudah siap untuk dikawinkan sehingga segera memperoleh anak babi untuk dijual kembali","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Melaya, Bali","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":82,"posted_date":"2007-09-27T13:00:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":175,"lender_count":2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ni Ketut Suarti","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-10-11T13:34:36Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":175,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2007-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2008-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2008-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2008-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2008-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":29.15}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2008-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":29.15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":30,"local_amount":30,"processed_date":"2007-10-12T05:37:11Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-24T10:24:56Z","rounded_local_amount":30,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":66080},{"amount":30,"local_amount":30,"processed_date":"2007-11-26T02:38:52Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-24T10:24:56Z","rounded_local_amount":30,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":86605},{"amount":30,"local_amount":30,"processed_date":"2007-12-21T01:42:56Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-24T10:24:56Z","rounded_local_amount":30,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":100264},{"amount":30,"local_amount":30,"processed_date":"2008-01-21T07:17:29Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-24T10:24:56Z","rounded_local_amount":30,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":119062},{"amount":30,"local_amount":30,"processed_date":"2008-02-20T01:27:20Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-24T10:24:56Z","rounded_local_amount":30,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":138522},{"amount":25,"local_amount":25,"processed_date":"2008-03-24T04:40:34Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-24T10:24:56Z","rounded_local_amount":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":164677}],"funded_date":"2007-09-27T13:34:36Z","paid_date":"2008-03-24T04:40:34Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":23333,"name":"Heng","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Heng T. was married in 1988 and has 4 children, 3 sons and 1 daughter.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":271106,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing

Republic. She is the coordinator for her group, Luz en Desarrollo (Developing Light), and her story is representative of the other borrowers in the group.\r\n\r\nJoaquina has a small business selling home decorations to her friends and the people in her neighborhood. With this loan, her very first with Esperanza International, she will be purchasing Christmas decorations to sell at a small markup. She also buys fabrics, bathroom decorations, and other types of interior decorations to sell to her customers. In addition to buying more inventory, Joaquina will purchase a new fan for her business so that it is more comfortable for her customers.\r\n\r\nJoaquina, her husband, and her children live in a difficult area. Los Alcarrizos can be a tough place to live with no potable running water, little access to electricity, and poor sanitation. Despite those difficulties, Joaquina is optimistic for the future.

He operates a business selling cold, purified water that he processes himself.  He also has a second business renting washing machines.  Leonardo wants to buy a trailer for his motorcycle so that he can more easily carry tanks of water and he needs to buy more tanks so that he can expand his water business.  That\u00b4s why he\u00b4s applying for a COP$1,000,000 loan.\r\nLeonardo is a bookkeeper and he worked for the state in Malambo for 6 years before he was laid off 2 years ago.  He used his severance pay to start a business selling cold meats.  He then hit on the idea of renting washing machines, a business for which he bought two machines.  A year ago, the Fundacion Mario Santo Domingo matched him with a microbusiness selling purified water.  He started working for the business as a salesman.  When he saw the potential for the business, he applied to the Fundacion for a loan so that he could start his own business.  He bought a water purifier with three filters and 1 storage tank and the business now generates more than his other.  The problem is that he can\u00b4t easily carry the water so he has asked his sister to help him by riding along in a sidecar for deliveries.  Leonardo says that his life has changed since he received his first Fundacion loan because it\u00b4s allowed him to set up his own business and increased his income.  Losing his job was a challenge, but it has allowed him to develop his potential as an entrepreneur.  Since he doesn\u00b4t have a house of his own, he operates the business at his mother\u00b4s house.  Leonardo is very happy with the business because he can sell safe water to the people of Malambo where the feeling is that the water is not safe.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jere

This area is known for the delicious sweets prepared by the inhabitants, which are recognized throughout the country, and for the warmth of its people, who are friendly and hard-working. \r\n\r\nIn this place, we meet Mercedes, who is 46 years old and lives with her common-law husband, with whom she has three children. All of her children are grown and study at the university. Her husband has a furniture-making workshop. \r\n\r\nShe is a very good homemaker because she helps her husband with the household expenses, by dedicating herself to raising chickens. She has a small chicken-raising operation at her home. She has done this for four years, and it has gone very well for her. She works every day. She buys the chicks from an incubator, and after three or four months, she delivers them to various stores in Rocafuerte and also sells them to commercial buyers who come to her home. Her children help her with this work. \r\n\r\nShe will use this loan to buy more chickens, as well as medicines and feed so that they will achieve good growth. She has been with the communal bank for three loan cycles. \r\n \r\nHer dream is that her children will become successful professionals.

She is married to Gabriel, a driver, and mother of two children, one of whom is in college, while the other is in elementary school, a dream for most Filipino parents like Petronila, as she herself has been an undergraduate and believes that a college diploma is the best inheritance parents can leave to their children.\r\n\r\nPetronila operates a firewood and charcoal retailing business. In the Philippines, many still use the old ways of cooking (on an earthen stove where firewood is used) to save money. Firewood and charcoal is way cheaper than LPG fuel, which in the current market costs as much as Php 600, and a lot of people in the provinces prefer to buy firewood, which is so cheap that it can be bought for Php 20 a bundle. Petronila also earns by selling the firewood to suppliers who buy it in bulk. More people are also switching to firewood which can be foraged or found in the trash. \r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php 10,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy more quantities of wood and charcoal to rebundle and retail to her customers. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nPetronila dreams of being able to give both her children a good and high quality education through all her hard work on her business. She also hopes to have her family and community with her as she continues to serve the Lord Almighty through her business.

For a short while now he has been working in the production of adobe bricks. He started the business when he realized that many people have begun construction on their homes. His brick sales increase the family's income. He makes the bricks in an area alongside his home without having to spend the day at a distance from his family. He enjoys his work because since he was a boy he has liked and been interested in the production of bricks.

The greatest challenge that has been presented to him during this time is that of economic resources, to be able to provide better maintenance to his cultivation of pineapples, since they are lacking the necessary supplies and the fruit ends up very small.  If in time he manages to implement the necessary fertilizers and supplies, he will be able to yield quality products.  This would benefit him because it would be easier to sell large pineapples at a better price, thereby increasing his earnings.  Also, he would pay off his loan on time and improve the quality of life for his family.  Luis lives with his wife in the neighborhood La Borgona, located in the municipality of Ticuantepe.  She works as a merchant to support him with the basic domestic expenses, such as water and electricity.  They have four older children, all of whom live with them and work with Luis in agriculture.

Although he has never married and has no children of his own, he is very affectionate with children.  His house is very far from the city but it is a very appropriate location for the work he does.  He is a watchman at a mine; he works from 6pm until 7am.  During his time off he likes to engage in commercial activities.  He used to sell charcoal and fish but this turned out to be not very profitable.  One day, while he was walking in the countryside, an old woman gave him a piglet.  He thought the piglet would require a lot of his time so he wasn't too anxious to accept it.  Finally, however, he agreed to raise it.  When the piglet reached the proper weight, he used its meat to prepare \"chicarrones\" (pot-fried pork) and he sold a few portions.  He never imagined that he would become a successful cook and chicarron salesman.  He now raises his own pigs.  Although V\u00edctor was never able to find the old woman who gave him his first pig again, he lives grateful to her for having started him off on his current economic activity.  This is his second loan with MFP and he is very happy with the results of his past investment and for the level of responsibility of his fellow group members.  The funds requested will be used to build a corral that will be adequate to raise his 7 pigs since his goal is to increase the number of animals so that he can have a large chicarron restaurant.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":476292,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To build a corral for his pigs.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-01-25T18:50:13Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":300,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Victor","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-01-04T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":800,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":133},{"due_date":"2010-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":133},{"due_date":"2010-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":133},{"due_date":"2010-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":133},{"due_date":"2010-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":133},{"due_date":"2010-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":135}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.88},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.87},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.88},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.87},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.88},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.62}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":49.88,"local_amount":133,"processed_date":"2010-02-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:48:41Z","rounded_local_amount":142.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123960266},{"amount":49.87,"local_amount":133,"processed_date":"2010-03-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:32:31Z","rounded_local_amount":142.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128993110},{"amount":49.88,"local_amount":133,"processed_date":"2010-04-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:37:06Z","rounded_local_amount":142.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136717896},{"amount":49.87,"local_amount":133,"processed_date":"2010-05-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:39:11Z","rounded_local_amount":142.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144751571},{"amount":49.88,"local_amount":133,"processed_date":"2010-06-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:02:27Z","rounded_local_amount":142.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151934039},{"amount":50.62,"local_amount":135,"processed_date":"2010-07-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:36:23Z","rounded_local_amount":144.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159672792}],"funded_date":"2010-01-26T00:06:40Z","paid_date":"2010-08-15T11:36:23Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":175358,"name":"Omolara","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Omolara is a member of the Yoruba tribe and lives with her family in Nigeria.

He sells these items as a traveling salesman in the nearby areas like San Miguel, Agua Blanca, and Chilete (towns that belong to the region of Cajamarca).

As an added value, Freddy, doctors and health professionals offer medical advice at the store to prevent self-medication, as a way to focus his social responsibility with his customers; he guides them with everything related to medical prescriptions, managing dietary nutrition, etc.\r\n\r\nHis business idea was born when he was in Caracas, capital of Venezuela, and he was working as a consultant in a project for drugstore owners; he learned about the liquidity and profitability of this business. He was also close to many experiences of how owners managed their businesses and this finally prompted him to make the decision to start his own business. For this reason, when he came to Colombia and his Mom insisted that he setup a drugstore, he did not hesitate.

She has had her fast food business for some years now.  Her daughter helps her sell the food until 10:00 p.m.\r\n\r\nTo have the business she had to invest her savings in supplies for food.  Little by little, and with effort, her food business was growing.  Now she has a fast food stand, and she sells rice with chicken and meat.  \r\n\r\nTo give her customers better service she wants to make adaptations to her food stand.  She will use the loan to buy cane, cement, and supplies.\r\n\r\nOne of her goals is to have her own restaurant and to have sports fields to rent.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny

This activity has been beneficial to her because most of the people in her locality make tortillas at home every day to eat.  Therefore, the service Ignacia provides is basic which has provided her with guaranteed daily income.  This has allowed her to improve her locale because at the beginning it was made from cardboard sheets, as was her house, and now it is stone.\r\n\r\nShe uses the loan to provide maintenance and repair for the mill and to buy parts, like gears and bearings, to replace deteriorated ones.  These parts need to be changed periodically due to use and this isn\u2019t counting some breakdowns caused by the machine\u2019s age since it has been in operation for 60 years.\r\n\r\nShe has 6 children (3 boys: Gustavo, 23, Daniel, 19 and Jos\u00e9 Manuel, 17, and Antonia, 28, Juana, 26 and Guadalupe, 21).\r\n\r\nShe has been in this line of work for 26 years.

She is a resident of Malabor, Tibiao Antique, Philippines. Her husband died five years ago and she has taken on the role of being both mother and father to her children. Her eldest child is 27 years old and her youngest is nine. Because of poverty, two of her children have only completed high school, but she has never lost hope because she has still one child who is studying.\r\n\r\nAfter her husband died, Clarita focused much of her time on fish vending to move on and to provide for the needs of her family. She doubled up her work efforts because she did not want her children to go hungry or get sick. Clarita hopes that at least one of her children will finish college because she knows that it is very difficult to find work without a good education.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Clarita had the opportunity to join ASHI when ASHI ANB opened an expansion program. Clarita\u2019s dreams were the basic requirements of membership. Her first loan was for 5,000 PHP which she used to expand her fish selling business. \r\n\r\nClarita is requesting a second loan of 10,000 PHP to use as additional capital for her business. The income that she will gain will be a great help to provide for her family and support her child who is still studying. Clarita also dreams that her business will improve with the help of ASHI and Kiva, and she hopes to expand her fish selling business to the wholesale level if she has enough capital.

While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nVilla is married and has 3 school-aged children. To make a living, Villa prepares and sells cooked food for daily meals. Villa has been engaged in her business for more than a year and earns approximately 2500 PHP each month.\r\n\r\nVilla joined ASKI this year to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Villa is requesting her first loan, for 6000 PHP, to be used to purchase raw ingredients needed to make products for sale. She plans to use the additional revenue generated as a result of the loan to improve and expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 38 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fishers and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Santo Domingo se encuentra conectando la Regi\u00f3n Sierra con la Regi\u00f3n Costa del Ecuador, es una ciudad que se ha convertido en un eje comercial con varios sectores en crecimiento y como prueba se tiene a varias familias emprendedoras que hace algunos a\u00f1os comenzaron con peque\u00f1os negocios y ahora son microempresarios que aportan a la generaci\u00f3n de empleo. Los estudios revelan que todos los negocios en su mayor\u00eda, empezaron emp\u00edricamente y han tenido acogida por el paso de turistas, empresarios y viajeros que se trasladan de una regi\u00f3n a otra y adem\u00e1s que es la tercera ciudad m\u00e1s habitada en el pa\u00eds.

He did not have the opportunity for an education, and from childhood he helped his parents in agricultural work. He is married to Maria, who is 54 years old, and they have no children. They live in Santo Domingo canton in the province of Santo Domingo of the Ts\u00e1chilas. Santo Domingo connects the mountain region with the coastal region of Ecuador. It is a city that has become a commercial axis with various growth sectors, and as proof can be taken a number of entrepreneurial families who began some years ago with little businesses and now are microentrepreneurs who contribute to the generation of employment. Studies reveal that the majority of all businesses began empirically and were welcomed by the passage of tourists, businesspeople, and travelers who move from one region to another, and in addition, the city has the third largest population in the country. \r\n\r\nRoberto lives in the Luz de America parish of this canton, a sector that is considered the port of entry to the province. Because of the richness of its land, it has been the origin of various food-producing businesses, in addition to being an area with great production of papayas, an exotic fruit exported from here. It is for this reason that the great majority of the inhabitants of this parish work in agriculture, which has been the motivation for various entrepreneurs of this zone to strengthen this activity with their work, experience, and effort.\r\n\r\nIn a number of parts of the city are lands producing all types of crops. On one of these is Roberto, who has already worked in agriculture for 40 years. He works all day, planting, harvesting, fumigating, and doing all the work that obtaining a final product of good quality demands. With the help of his wife, he achieves good results in spite of the losses of crops that occur because of unexpected weather changes and natural phenomena that arrive in the area at certain times of the year. The greatest obstacle that he has always had is the lack of economic resources to invest in his business, but now he has found Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa, which, through the Kiva loans, has offered him the convenience of accessing a loan that he will use to buy seeds and supplies for planting and caring for his crops.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.<P>\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.<P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She tells us that she decided to open this business because there had previously been no drugstore in the area, and people had to go into town to purchase supplies. \r\n\r\nHer husband is an occasional laborer who fills temporary jobs in fishing and agriculture. Thanks to both of their efforts, they were able to purchase a photocopier four months ago, which they intend to use to broaden their current business. \r\n\r\nMercedes plans to expand her business by purchasing more medicines and selling office supplies. For this reason, she is requesting her first loan with Edpyme Alternativa in the amount of 1000 Peruvian soles, which she will use to achieve her business objectives. \r\n\r\nMercedes is a responsible and hardworking mother; her business is well-known in the area, and her neighbors have great respect for her.

She is the coordinator for her group, Nuevo Renacer (Rebirth), and her story is representative of those in her group and other Dominican and Haitian borrowers at Esperanza International.\r\n<p>\r\nMaria is a single mother who lives with her two children in Samana, a small city in the northeastern region of the Dominican Republic. Life in the Dominican Republic can be rough, with no potable running water, frequent power outages (if one has power to begin with), and inadequate healthcare. Despite these difficulties, Maria runs a successful business selling home products to her friends and neighbors. With this loan, Maria will purchase sheet sets to sell to her friends and neighbors for a small profit.\r\n<p>\r\nThis is Maria\u2019s eighth loan with Esperanza International, and she hopes to continue taking out loans to grow her business and improve her home life for her family. With her profits, Maria hopes to purchase a small van in order to make her business more mobile. This will add to her profits, which will allow her to improve life at home by finishing her bathroom and purchasing a computer for her children. Computers are difficult to afford, but are one of the best investments for a low-income household to make. It gives access to the world of information that those of us in the developed world take for granted while teaching children to use the invaluable tools of modern technology.

He lives in his own home with his wife Elsa, 22, and their 3 beloved children, to whom they wish to provide a better future.  The fields that he cultivates have been, in the life of Aldo, an activity that has been necessary for survival; from the time that he was very small his parents always taught him that by working in the fields he would never lack for anything.  For this reason, he decided to continue in his family's line of work, and now he has his own cultivations where he plants bananas and coffee.  What he likes most about his work is to plant, because he knows that the economic tranquility of his family depends on this activity.  He has been doing this work for 8 years, and what he considers most difficult is to care for his crops when there are abrupt changes in the weather.

This is their first loan with the institution.\r\n\r\nMa\u00efmouna, sitting in the middle of the photo, intends to use her loan to buy agricultural supplies and tools and pay for plowing and weeding. She has around 0.5 hectares of farmland to grow rice and groundnuts. The harvested products will be sold at the markets in Baou, Koula, Banco and N'Golobougou to a clientele made up of men and women. She expects to make an average profit of around 70,000 CFA francs by the end of the season.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":835600,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"to pay for plowing and weeding, and to buy seeds, fertilizer, herbicide and tools.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Baou","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":750,"lender_count":27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Djelika                    ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ma\u00efmouna            ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Moussokoura    ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Matou                    ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ami Moussa        ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Minata Salam   ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Oumou                      ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Soumba                   ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yassa                    ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sanata               ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-07-05T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":340000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":340000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":750}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":750,"local_amount":340000,"processed_date":"2012-03-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-11T08:19:39Z","rounded_local_amount":344815.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270139832}],"funded_date":"2011-09-03T13:08:53Z","paid_date":"2012-05-11T08:19:39Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Robert Mouris","image":538858}},{"id":327429,"name":"Juan Carlos","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Don Juan de profesion tecnico soldador, labora desde hace veintiun a\u00f1os, pues es negocio propio, el cual aprendio en sus trabajos anteriores.\nHoy en dia tambien vende vehiculos cuando le sale la oportunidad, ganandose ese dinero extra,  es padre de cinco hijos los dos mayores trabajan y su esposa trabaja en servicios domesticos.\nLo que desea hacer don Carlos con este nuevo financiamiento es las divisiones de los cuartos, ya que tiene esta necesidad, para lograr privacidad con su familia. siendo Afodenic, el que ha hecho posible esta mejoras a su vivivenda\nPara esto comprara: bloques, arena, cemento, hierro y poder, hacer la obra.\n\n","en":"Don Juan has worked as a professional welder for 21 years.

He is 46, married with three children and lives in the village of Saatli town in the south-central flat area of the Azerbaijan Republic in the Caucasus region.\r\n\r\nVasif owns a herd of cattle.  Each morning he grazes his herd and then sells beef in the local market of Saatli town.  He uses some of his profit margin to buy calves to breed.

Ahora con su pareja actual, ambos tejen, Rosa se levanta a las 3.00am para avanzar con sus tejidos y apartir de las 5.30am se dedica a su otro negocio, que es un restaurante que abri\u00f3 hace 3 meses, al que a\u00fan no se acostumbra, ya que lo m\u00e1s le gusta es tejer, pero la necesidad econ\u00f3mica les oblig\u00f3 a buscar nuevas fuentes de ingreso, debido a que la artesan\u00eda es muy rentable en ciertas temporadas, pero para cubrir los meses donde la demanda baja decidieron empezar a vender comida.  Y es justamente en el mes pr\u00f3ximo de abril, en semana santa, cuando sus artesan\u00edas les dejan muy buenas ganancias. Rosa es la presidenta de su banco comunal, en este cargo dice sentirse muy bien, y est\u00e1 demostrando ser una cliente muy responsable, tanto en los pagos de sus cuotas con el sus funciones dentro de su grupo. Este es su 3er pr\u00e9stamo con MFP. El dinero que est\u00e1 solicitando lo derivar\u00e1 a la compra de materiales para su artesan\u00eda, asimismo comprar\u00e1 un saco de arroz y un balde de aceite para su restaurante.","en":"\r\n\r\nRosa is 44 years old and has had 3 children with her first husband, who has passed away. Now she is responsible for 2 of the children. Craftmenship is one of the abilities that she got from her parents. When she lived with her first husband,, she prepared the threads so that he could weave with the best speed. Now with her partner, both make textiles. Rosa wakes up at 3am in order to make her textiles and at 5:30am, she works at her other business, a restaurant that she opened 3 months ago. She isn't used to running the restaurant, and what she likes best is to make textiles. However, economic necessity obligates her to make new sources of income, since craftsmanship is only profitable at certain times. To cover the months of low demand, she started selling food. It is just next month, the month of April during Holy Week, that craftsmen make the best earnings. Rosa is the president of her communal bank, in this she is doing well, and she is proving to be a very responsible member with her payments and her functions in the group. This is her third loan with MFP (field partner.) The money that she is asking for will be used for buying materials for her craftsmenship, a bag of rice and a bucket of oil for her restaurant.          <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Caitlin Brooks, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":292714,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Textiles","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"Buying materiales for making blankets and supplies for her restaurant","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-03-23T18:00:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":650,"lender_count":26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-03-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":650}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":650,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2010-01-08T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:10:17Z","rounded_local_amount":2017.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118123943}],"funded_date":"2009-03-23T22:23:14Z","paid_date":"2010-02-15T12:10:17Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Caitlin Brooks","image":263842}},{"id":101228,"name":"Sum","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Sum M., 46, and her husband, Mr. Phally Sok, 46, live along the Tonle Basac River (a tributary of the nearby Mekong) about fifteen kilometers from Phnom Penn, the capital city of Cambodia.

Opportunity of getting better and well compensated job for them is hard though. During the times wherein they are studying, it was so hard for Teresita to provide their needs at the same time providing also he needs of her business with such a very small amount of capital. A profit she makes out of this business is her family\u2019s main source of income since her husband\u2019s livelihood being a laborer is sporadic since then and now. Depending on it alone, there could have been no food on their table as regular as it should be, and her two children could not have graduated from high school.  However, for Teresita it is never too late yet to keep on dreaming for her children. Loan she requests now is her opportunity of achieving it. Once she had made her business grow, she could be of great help to her children and can as well provide her children source of income. The entire family can be working in the business to make it successful provided they have sufficient capital through loan."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":401316,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

He lives with his wife Gloria, 40, and their youngest daughter Jacqueline who is 11 years old.  They have 3 grown  children who are studying in the capital, Lima.  <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nFrom the time he was very young, Sergio had a passion for fixing things,  making it natural that he would work in electronics.   Sergio says, emotionally, \"I have 35 years dedicated to this work, and it has allowed me to pay for the education of my children, and build my house, and given me clients who hold me in high esteem which is the most gratifying for me\".   There is nothing in the world that would make him want to leave his work.  In the future he wants to open a branch called Electronica F. II.   He would also like to build another house so that his children will have some independence.    This is the first loan with MFP, and he is sure he can make each payment on time.  He also plans to work actively in the communal bank.   This loan will be used to purchase supplies for his shop such as electronic components and used parts.  \r\n\r\n\r\n <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Emily Charnes, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":476417,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Electronics Repair","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"To purchase supplies for his shop such as electronic components and used parts","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Chanchamayo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.05 -75.316667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-01-24T19:40:11Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":200,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sergio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-01-14T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2010-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2010-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2010-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2010-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2010-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":85}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.2},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.2},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.2},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.2},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.2},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":33.2,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2010-02-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:48:57Z","rounded_local_amount":94.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123960270},{"amount":33.2,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2010-03-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:32:53Z","rounded_local_amount":94.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128993114},{"amount":33.2,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2010-04-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:37:24Z","rounded_local_amount":94.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136717900},{"amount":33.2,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2010-05-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:39:27Z","rounded_local_amount":94.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144751575},{"amount":33.2,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2010-06-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:02:36Z","rounded_local_amount":94.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151934043},{"amount":34,"local_amount":85,"processed_date":"2010-07-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:36:32Z","rounded_local_amount":96.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159672817}],"funded_date":"2010-01-24T22:12:17Z","paid_date":"2010-08-15T11:36:32Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Emily charnes","image":51249}},{"id":175393,"name":"Llerme","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Llerme tiene 58 a\u00f1os de edad, es oriunda de la selva peruana y tiene 6 hijos adultos.

Sacllo is known for having many agricultural and livestock farms.  Several years ago, a group of neighbors and friends formed the communal bank, \"Se\u00f1or de Pan de Az\u00facar de Sacllo,\" which is currently in its 6th cycle.  This communal bank is composed of 11 women and 2 men, all of whom are workers and business owners that are always looking for opportunities to move ahead and whom dedicate their daily hard work to being able to give their children a better future.  It is a communal bank made up of members that live within the community of Sacllo.  The following are some of the economic sectors that the members work in: the sale of vegetables, grocery items, fruits, chicha, milk, sweets, and baby animals, and one member provides teaching services.  Cusco is known for being a charming city located in the Southern Region of Peru.  It is popular for its archaeological monuments, its historical city center, its landscapes, and its history.  \r\n\r\nBasilia is a part of the communal bank, \"Se\u00f1or de Pan de Az\u00facar de Sacllo.\"  She is a single mother of three children.

Basilia sells vegetables and chicha, and works in the rearing of baby animals.  She needs a loan so that she can purchase more baby animals and seeds.  The members of her bank are thankful for the granted opportunity and they promise to fulfill the loan payments by the designated deadlines.     <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Tracy Quan, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2900,"image":{"id":505020,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Basilia plans to use the loan to purchase more baby animals and seeds.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Calca - Calca - Cusco","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":119,"posted_date":"2010-04-10T12:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2900,"lender_count":113,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":" Basilia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Patricia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Angelica","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Carmen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Vilma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Cirila","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rufina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Petronila","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juan","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Luis","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lucila","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Benita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Dolores","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-10T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":8200,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":2900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1236.24},{"due_date":"2010-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1285.69},{"due_date":"2010-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":1337.12},{"due_date":"2010-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":1390.61},{"due_date":"2010-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":1446.24},{"due_date":"2010-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1504.1}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":437.21},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":454.69},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":472.89},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":491.8},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":511.47},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":531.94}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":437.26,"local_amount":1236.38,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T09:49:11Z","rounded_local_amount":1239.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136633613},{"amount":454.77,"local_amount":1285.9,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T08:48:53Z","rounded_local_amount":1289.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144668026},{"amount":472.96,"local_amount":1337.33,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:24:23Z","rounded_local_amount":1340.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151851691},{"amount":491.86,"local_amount":1390.79,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T10:14:07Z","rounded_local_amount":1394.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159589978},{"amount":511.52,"local_amount":1446.38,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T09:40:47Z","rounded_local_amount":1450.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166800740},{"amount":531.63,"local_amount":1503.22,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T09:43:51Z","rounded_local_amount":1507.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172070551}],"funded_date":"2010-04-16T13:51:48Z","paid_date":"2010-10-15T09:43:51Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tracy Quan","image":null}},{"id":196312,"name":"Carmen Rosa","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"\nLA SRA.

","en":"Mr. Orlando Rafael Alvarez V. is 30 years old, married, and he lives with his wife in a neighborhood called Buenos Aires. She too is a merchant and adds income to the family economy.  Orlando dedicates himself to the sale of second-hand and new clothes, and has also done electrical work. For more than 4 years, he has worked in the wholesale distribution of goods, supplying the capital's markets, while hoping for a better future.\r\n\r\nOne of the greatest problems he has endured during his career, has been the lack of financial support that microfinance banks offer. Orlando has lacked the few resources that ensure good pay, but with the accessibility of Afodenic, and thanks to Kiva funds, he can now have access to a loan to purchase a larger inventory of merchandise, which will increase his sales volume and produce a higher income.

He was encouraged to become a GHAPE member in 2007 as he was finding it too difficult to take care of his family and he was looking for business capital. Also, he has been having a lot of marital problems with his wife. This has made him feel sad all the time but he is appreciative of the fact that he is alive. His desire is to give his children love and education. He states that he feels better each time he provides something for his children.\r\n\r\nSince 2007, he has taken and repaid two loans and has proven himself to be very hardworking. His inability to get investment capital, which could constantly generate income for him to meet his children\u2019s needs, is what motivated him to obtain a loan from GHAPE.\r\n\r\nGiven a loan, he plans to buy palm nuts, groundnuts and farm tools for sale. These articles are in high demand in his area. He knows this business will succeed because he is located at a good business site. He plans to use the profits generated to sponsor his children in school and to cater for the basic needs of his family. \r\n\r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon.  GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach.  Every client is trained in business management, basic health, life skills, financial management, profits and losses, and family values.  Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement.  GHAPE instils a sense of family and community within its clients and staff and has developed a strong bond of trust between the organization and its clients.

She owns a business venture, planting & harvesting taro for sale.  Palepa has many years of experience in this business.  Palepa needs a loan of WST 1500 to invest in expanding the business.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 500 talas or US $208 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Palepa joined SPBD.  This is her 2nd loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Palepa's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\n\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She finished only high school but is confident that she will become a successful micro entrepreneur. Nicky, as she is called by friends, is married to Emildo, a motorcycle taxi driver. They reside in Parola, Binondo, at the heart of Manila and together they are raising three children. One of them studies in college, another is in elementary school, while the third stays at home.\r\n\r\nNicky has run her own sari-sari (variety) store at home for two years now. She sells goods at a cheap per-piece price to accommodate the immediate needs of her neighbors, such as a sachet of shampoo for an employee who needs to bathe before going to work, or a small amount of salt that a cook needs to season her food. Nicky is also into the buy and sell business. With these, she earns roughly PHP 11,000 per month.\r\n\r\nTo help her grow her business, Nicky has requested a loan of PHP 14,000. With this she plans to buy four sacks of rice, which she will repackage for retail. She also intends to purchase more grocery items to add to the various products on her store shelves. With this loan, she knows she will be able to earn more profits and save more.\r\n\r\nNicky's biggest challenge is that she has lists of debts that her customers sometimes fail to pay because of financial constraints. But being the determined micro entrepreneur that she is, she seeks a solution to this problem. This is all for the purpose of achieving her dream of having a profitable business, a good life, and a sustained education for her children.\r\n\r\nAs a CCT community partner, she faithfully attends the group's weekly fellowship* meeting where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she receives.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance

She is a mother of one and married to Renato, a security guard. She and her husband manage their own household while operating a business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nLea operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store that sells groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, cooking oil, or an egg. Lea earns income by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 533 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a loan of PHP 35,000. She will be using the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, beverages and charcoal to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. Lea hopes to be able to expand soon, just as she dreams to be able to give her child a high quality education through all of her hard work.

He lives in his own place that is located in the western area of town. He lives with his 52-year-old wife. Their children are already grown and they visit every weekend. Pedro works selling plastics, groceries and other products as a street vendor and in the same place he wife also sells groceries. Both activities are done in their own house and they have many years of experience. The truth is that both businesses are relatively competitive, since they are located in a good area and mainly run out of their own home. In addition, now they have established clients. Pedro has invested his entire loan in what he proposed, which is to say: groceries and plastics. This is Pedro's third loan and all of his previous ones have been paid back.

He lives in the Laureles Norte neighborhood of Managua.  His priorities are to provide the best for his sons and one of his plans is the expansion of his bakery which has been offering excellent service and product quality for the past 11 years.  At first, it was very difficult to establish a client base since he inherited the profession from his father and it was his sole source of income.  The requested loan will be used to purchace raw materials like:  flours, yeast, lard, sugar, packing materials, and baking pans to offer his delicious products.

traditional housing tent, in Hovd province, western Mongolia. \r\n\r\nHe was a driver and used to work in the government organization till 2005. Since then, he has been operating a car repair and welding service in his home. After years of successful operation, he has built his business to a consistent level with a stable operation.

She is 49 years old. Merlina is married and has two adult-aged children. To make a living, she owns and operates a business venture in the services sector, providing recycling services. The main source of income for the business comes from hauling junk and other waste material for local businesses and community members. She has been engaged in her business for over eleven years and earns approximately $233 a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2006, Merlina joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 25,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional waste and junk material to sell. \r\n\r\nMerlina is requesting a new loan of 30,000 PHP which will be used to purchase used bottles and newspapers to sell. This will be her 9th loan from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated to improve her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful micro-finance institutions in the Philippines. It has 38 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and
