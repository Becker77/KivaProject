Celsa C. is 29 years old and married.  She lives in a humble home with her husband Pedro Villalba who is 36 years old and helps with the income of the house.  Celsa has a dispensary in her house, and her husband is a specialist in the preparation of chacinados.  They have 2 children, 3 and 5 years old, who make up the harmonious family life. <\/p>\r\n<p> Celsa and her husband manage the dispensary where they sell all types of every day items such as sugar, milk, meat, eggs, vegetables, etc, and a special compliment of chacinados which Pedro is in charge of.  He prepares sausages, mortadela, ham, cold cuts, etc.  When the company where Pedro worked had financial problems and collapsed, he was left unemployed, so he decided, along with his wife, to learn this business for himself. <\/p>\r\n<p>The experience of 10 years of sales of these products, the knowledge of the consumer market, and the necessity to survive, are some of the pillars that sustain these enterprising people.  They have hired other unemployed people, experimenting in the preparation of chacinados,  so the enterprise is already  giving work to others.  The small company produces according to demand so there is no set schedule, nor days of work.  They make the sales in the dispensary and by request.  Today Celsa is requesting a loan to buy a meat shredding machine.  The dream of these enterprising business owners is to offer the opportunity of work to many unemployed youths in the area. <\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\nCelsa C. de 29 a\u00f1os, es casada, vive en una humilde vivienda con su c\u00f3nyuge el se\u00f1or Pedro Villalba de tiene 36 a\u00f1os quien ayuda con los ingresos de la casa. Celsa tiene una  despensa en su casa, su marido es especialista en la elaboraci\u00f3n de los chacinados. Tienen 2 hijos menores de edad, de 3 y 5 a\u00f1os respectivamente, quienes comparten la armoniosa vida familiar.\r\nCelsa y su c\u00f3nyuge, atienden la despensa donde venden todo tipo de art\u00edculos de primera necesidad, como az\u00facar, leche, carne, huevos, hortalizas, etc. y un complemento especial de ventas es la de chacinados de la cual se encarga exclusivamente don Pedro. El elabora chorizos, mortadela, fiambre, jam\u00f3n etc. Cuando la empresa donde trabajaba don Pedro, tuvo problemas financieros y quebr\u00f3, el qued\u00f3 desempleado, decidi\u00f3 con su esposa emprender por cuenta propia esta actividad.\r\nLa experiencia de 10 a\u00f1os en la venta de estos productos, el conocimiento del mercado consumidor, y la necesidad de sobrevivir, son algunos de los pilares que sostiene a estos emprendedores. Para producir calidad han contratado a otros desempleados experimentados en esta actividad (elaboraci\u00f3n de chacinados), o sea que el emprendimiento ya est\u00e1 dando trabajo a otras personas. La microempresa produce de acuerdo a la demanda por lo tanto no existe horario, ni d\u00edas de trabajo.\r\nLas ventas las realizan en la despensa y bajo pedido, hoy d\u00eda Celsa est\u00e1 solicitando un cr\u00e9dito que  ser\u00e1 destinado a la compra de una m\u00e1quina trituradora de carne adem\u00e1s de los ingredientes para la elaboraci\u00f3n  para la compra de carne, especias. etc. El sue\u00f1o de estos micros emprendedores es ofrecer la oportunidad de trabajo a muchos j\u00f3venes desempleados de la zona.\r\n\r\n<p> Translated by Kiva volunteer, Emily Charnes

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":303844,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty

Not having attended school for societal reasons, she soon became interested fifteen years ago in earning an income to support herself through such work as small-scale commerce.  Highly experienced, she is appreciated and in much demand in Koutiala.   These days, Kadidia is leaning a lot more towards the wholesale distributing and selling of <i>ati\u00e9k\u00e9<\/i> (a cassava or yam foodstuff).  \r\n<p>\r\nConcerned about satisfying her customers, Kadidia turned toward the micro-finance institution Soro Yiriwaso two years ago.  After having settled an initial loan successfully, she envisions a second individual loan for a 12-month period in the amount of 500,000 francs CFA.  With this loan, she intends to resupply herself with a sizable stock of goods from Cote d\u2019Ivoire mostly for the retailers of <i>ati\u00e9k\u00e9<\/i> of Koutiala City.  In addition to restocking, she sells retail, aimed at consumers at the grand marketplace of Koutiala.  \r\n<p>\r\nWith this loan, she envisions realizing a profit of 150,000 francs CFA that will be used to make loan payments and to care for her children.  \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1025,"image":{"id":312614,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"To buy supplies of \"ati\u00e9k\u00e9\"","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Koutiala","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:16Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1025,"lender_count":32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kadidia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-04-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2010-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2010-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":170.83},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":170.83},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":170.83},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":170.83},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":170.83},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":170.85}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":170.83,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-06-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:23:55Z","rounded_local_amount":84468.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53020245},{"amount":170.83,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-08-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T22:44:39Z","rounded_local_amount":84468.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73678786},{"amount":170.83,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-10-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T07:11:14Z","rounded_local_amount":84468.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97028176},{"amount":170.83,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-12-14T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T17:04:26Z","rounded_local_amount":84468.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110763277},{"amount":170.83,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2010-02-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-16T08:48:27Z","rounded_local_amount":84468.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123991007},{"amount":170.85,"local_amount":83333.35,"processed_date":"2010-04-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T12:15:13Z","rounded_local_amount":84468.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136746132}],"funded_date":"2009-06-16T04:14:27Z","paid_date":"2010-05-15T12:15:13Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Daniel Kuey","image":669418}},{"id":109920,"name":"Mercy","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mercy N. is 35 years old and married with six children.

Dulamsuren is 52 years old and lives with her husband in Uvurkhangai province in central Mongolia. She and her husband live in a ger, which is a traditional Mongolian nomadic housing tent. She operates a dairy products trading business in her town. She purchases dairy products locally from herders in the surrounding countryside, and transports them back to her town to sell. \r\n\r\nDulamsuren started her business in 2008, after previously managing several different businesses over the years. She has worked hard and has built a stable operation over the last two years. She attributes her success to her good accounting skills and reasonable prices. Dulamsuren is looking toward the future and says, \"I hope to expand my business and own my own shop in the future.\" She is requesting a 2,000,000 tugrug (~1400 USD) loan to increase her inventory so that she has plenty to sell when supplies get short this winter.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout XacBank\r\nXacBank was founded in 2001, and listed its first loan on Kiva in January 2009.

It is currently utilizing Kiva\u2019s 0% lending interest rate to return 9% of interest paid from borrowers to them in the form of a savings account at the end of their loans.

Serigne Babacar Sy Group No. 14","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sope Serigne Babacar Sy is an association of female commercantes (vendors) working in Thies, a city about seventy kilometers from Dakar.\r\n\r\nThe association, named after an important marabout (a religious leader in West African Islam), was founded in 2006 by a group of entrepreneurial women from the Cit\u00e9 Lamy neighborhood. Their aim was to help the members finance their small businesses through a revolving savings fund called a tontine, in which members contribute a small amount to the pot each month to finance one member's activities.\r\n\r\nToday, the association has evolved to secure group loans for its members through cooperation with UIMCEC (Union of Institution Mutualiste Communautaire d\u2019Epargne et de Credit). Groups of five are financed through ten-month loans of which each member receives an equal amount. On the 20th of each month, the members of the association hold a meeting to collect the repayments.\r\n\r\nCurrently, there are fourteen groups of women financed through UIMCEC. Sope Serigne Babacar Sy is headed by Ms. Coumba Faye, the president, and Ms. Oumu Ngom, the treasurer.\r\n\r\nMs. Fatou G. is the head of Group No. 14. She, like many of the women, has a small stall in the market of Grand Thies, one of the bigger neighborhoods of Thies. She sells sandwiches, starting around 7 a.m. and often finishing around midnight. She says her specialty is a beef sandwich with fried onions. If she has the money, Ms. G. also buys handbags and bras to sell in the market. Ms. G. is married, and the mother of seven children.\r\n\r\nThree of the other group members also work in the Grand Thies market: Ms. Amy N. runs a small restaurant, serving rice dishes, such as thi\u00e9bu dieune (rice and fish); Ms. Fatou N. sells guedia (dried fish); and Ms. Ndeye Mari\u00e8me Djit\u00e9 sells women's clothing, mostly pants. The final group member, Ms. Adama N., sells vegetables and fish out of her home. Each member receives 100,000 FCFA to bolster their activities.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1125,"image":{"id":466134,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To use as additional capital for her business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SN","country":"Senegal","town":"THIES","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"14.783333 -16.966667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":108,"posted_date":"2010-01-11T15:00:11Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1125,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Fatou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Amy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ndeye Marieme","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Adama","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-12-21T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":1125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":112.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-01-21T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:49:26Z","rounded_local_amount":50818.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118168531},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-02-21T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T11:35:02Z","rounded_local_amount":50818.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":124007493},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-03-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T10:16:18Z","rounded_local_amount":50818.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":129036565},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-04-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T12:35:34Z","rounded_local_amount":50818.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136759123},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-05-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T10:16:08Z","rounded_local_amount":50818.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144790637},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-06-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-17T08:36:29Z","rounded_local_amount":50818.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151971076},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-07-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T12:16:04Z","rounded_local_amount":50818.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159708340},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-08-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-24T08:41:12Z","rounded_local_amount":50818.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166922411},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-09-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:49:01Z","rounded_local_amount":50818.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172188914},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-10-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-23T12:00:37Z","rounded_local_amount":50818.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177484358}],"funded_date":"2010-01-13T02:18:49Z","paid_date":"2010-11-23T12:00:37Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jeff Avery","image":233371}},{"id":171677,"name":"Jeanne","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"B.

Jeanne was born in 1963 in Cotonou, the economic capital of Benin.  She became situated in Y\u00e9nawa, a district of Cotonou, about fifteen years ago.  She is married to HOUNSOU Nicolas and is the mother of two children, who are both in school.  The family lives together in Y\u00e9nawa.  Thanks to the revenues she earns from her business, Jeanne works in aid of her husband where it concerns maintaining the children's education.\r\n\r\nBasically, Jeanne did not attend school, but she has been selling canned drinks in her store for ten years.  She stocks up in Lom\u00e9, Togo, a country neighboring Benin.  \r\n\r\nShe is a previous client of ALID\u00e9 having already obtained three loans from it.  She has repaid these three loans.  Jeanne envisions increasing her inventory of goods and diversifying her business by selling a variety of other products.  This will enable her to do better in satisfying the demands of her customers.  But due to few financial means available to her, she is requesting a fourth loan to expand her business.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva

She began working as a production assistant in a recreational fireworks company.  Thanks to the fact that she was able to save some of her income, she used her expertise to set up her own fireworks business called \"El Trueno\" (thunder).  She also works at night as a cook in a restaurant four times a week.  Most of her customers are people who visit the central part of the country.  \r\n\r\nWith her income she is able to cover the essential household expenses.

All of them are from the same community.  The name of the group was chosen by a person who is no longer a member.  This group has worked a long time with Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad, so some members have left while new ones have joined.  This name was chosen by Don Manuel and the more recent members believe he was raising geese at the time.  \r\n<p>\r\nDo\u00f1a Eva is also a member of this group.  She is 63 years old, widowed, and has no dependents.  Eva currently lives near one of her children, but she has a grandchild who lives with her now that her family is not together.  Thanks to her access to credit, she has been able to benefit from the loans.  Eva previously bought and sold pigs and used her profits to improve her home.  She opened a grocery store, but also invested in a business of renting out chairs and tables for special events in the community and the surrounding areas.  Her services are requested for baptisms, first communions, school graduations, and other events in which she does her best.  Eva has 60 tables and 108 chairs, so she is requesting a loan so that she can buy 60 tablecloths for covering the tables.  The tables were brought in from Mexico City and she has been in business for almost a year.  She hopes to have more chairs so that she can provide better service to her customers.

They will yield a harvest in 6 months and will become food for her family and for other consumers. Farmers always have to be very careful with the planting since that is the first step in achieving their production goals and in increasing their income. This is why they disinfect the seeds so carefully. A big limiting factor for her is not being able to buy more seeds due to the fact that their price is very significant in the local market of her city.

I reside in a famous historical place named Yadgar of City Lahore, Pakistan. I have been living in this city for the past 20 years. I got my education up until the 8th grade but for more education, I didn\u2019t show any interest. From the beginning I have had an interest in sewing clothes and embroidery. My husband's name is W. M. S. and he has a scrap business. He sells scrap to the community. In particular, he keeps iron in his stock, and people come to sell and buy iron and other iron items from him. \r\n\r\nI have six children: four daughters and two sons. My eldest daughter is in the 9th grade. The one next to her is in the 8th standard. The youngest to her is in the 7th standard, and my youngest daughter is in the 4th standard. My sons are also read in the 4th standard. I and my husband have decided to share the financial burden. I help him by paying the children\u2019s education expenses through sewing clothes, and he bears the house expenses through his income. I successfully repaid my five loans which I took from Asasah (a microfinance institute of Pakistan). Now I am applying for a loan to buy more scrap (iron) to increase the income of my husband. \r\n\r\nI am a group leader of a few more women of my locality. Shahnaz baji wants a loan to buy an auto-rickshaw (a three-wheeled motor vehicle). Mussarat baji wants a loan to buy paint for her paint business. Shahnaz baji and Nasreen baji each want a loan to buy scrap for their scrap businesses. \r\n\r\nThis is a group loan. The loan funds will be distributed among the group members, each of whom will invest in her own business. The members mutually guarantee one another's loans. If one member does not repay, the other members are responsible.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":245696,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To

En vista de la enfermedad de su padre decidi\u00f3 hacerse cargo de la educaci\u00f3n de sus hermanos menores, desde entonces siembra papas, arvejas y habas en chacras alquiladas, pagando por el arriendo entre 600 a 700 soles por cada siembra. Para esta labor cuenta con la ayuda de su madre y los fines de semana, de sus hermano y su padre. Wilder est\u00e1 muy contento de labrar la tierra y ser \u00fatil para su familia, eso lo llena de mucha alegr\u00eda. \u00daltimamente ha decidido sembrar sus propios cultivos para sus gastos personales, ahora en la chacra de papas, donde posa para la foto, va sembrar arvejas aprovechando los nutrientes del abonado de la siembra anterior. Nos cuenta que lo que requiere de mayor inversi\u00f3n es el cultivo de la papa, debido a la necesidad de fertilizantes y cuando no obtiene un buen precio en el mercado no alcanza las ganancias esperadas, es por ello que se va a dedicar m\u00e1s a la siembra de arvejas para alcanzar sus anhelos de contar con sus propias chacras. Este es su cuarto pr\u00e9stamo con MFP, durante los tres ciclos pasados demostr\u00f3 honestidad y puntualidad en sus pagos y trata de asistir a todas la reuniones de su banco comunal, donde se siente muy c\u00f3modo con todos los dem\u00e1s integrantes. El dinero que solicita es para la compra de dos bolsas de arvejas (semilla) en una variedad mejorada para que resista las diversas circunstancias clim\u00e1ticas.

In light his father\u2019s illness, Wilder decided to be in charge of his younger siblings\u2019 education.  From then on he planted potatoes, peas, and beans in rented fields.  He pays between 600 and 700 PEN for each planting.  His mother helps him with the work.  During the week ends his father and his siblings help him.\r\n\r\nWilder is very happy to work the land and to be useful to his family.  This fills him with joy.  He has decided to plant his own crops for his own personal expenses.  In the potato fields, where he poses for the photo, he will plant peas to take advantage of the fertilizer\u2019s nutrients from the last planting.\r\n\r\nHe needs more investment in his potato crop due to the need for fertilizers.  When he does not get a good price at the market, he does not reach his expected income.  That is why he is going to plant more peas to reach his goal of having his own fields.\r\n\r\nThis is his fourth loan with MFP.  During the past three loan cycles he has demonstrated honesty and punctuality in his payments.  He tries to attend all of his community bank\u2019s meetings.

She is 46 years old. She and her husband have four children (three sons and a daughter).\r\n\r\nGulzada was born into a simple family. She was the middle child, and spent most of her time working around the house: she looked after younger brothers and sisters, did her homework and did some housework.  Gulzada did very well in school and dreamed of becoming a teacher. After graduationg, she entered Osh State University in the physics and mathematics department. After finishing school, she married in 1984 and planned to work in her trade, but it was too difficult to live on a teacher\u2019s wages.  Gulzada and her husband decided to raise cattle. They began with one single lamb, and for ten years increased their livestock.  With the money they made, they constructed a small house in the village. At that time, 400 square meters of undeveloped land were allocated to each family.  Unfortunately, the income from selling the crop did not cover the expense of planting.  In 2000 the family decided to move to the Chuysky valley to their native village.  It was very difficult to sell their house and all of the cattle. When they moved to the village of Alekseyevka (in the northern part of the country), Gulzada\u2019s family bought a house, one milk cow, and two sheep. Eleven years have passed since then.  The family has had many hardships: in 2005 Gulzada and her husband decided to plant wheat, but because of a recession affecting the price of grain, the couple lost a great deal of money.  To pay their debts, Gulzada had to sell all of their cattle. Thanks to persistence, diligence, and family support, Gulzada\u2019s family has made it through and continues to work in their business. Today Gulzada\u2019s farm has two calves being fattened, two young cows, and she is cultivating potatoes.  \r\n\r\nGulzada had approached Bai-Tushum and Partners for a loan for 100,000 som (KGS) to buy calves and ewes.  Gulzada plans to use any money she makes to pay to educate her children.  \r\n\r\nBai-Tushum and Partners uses Kiva funding to target the especially vulnerable population.

He travels around the city, house to house,  buying these containers.  He mostly buys milk cans.  Once he has enough of these he takes them to the places that fill and sell paint so that they can use them to sell the paint.  She tells us that her husband has been doing this for more than 10 years and thankfully, this has allowed them to get ahead and meet their daily needs.  \r\n\r\nThis loan will be use to purchase plastic, aluminum and iron containers for recycling.

Mercy's biggest challenges are disease and a shortage of farm inputs. Farmers in the area lack capital to purchase farm inputs such as chemicals to prevent these diseases. Mercy made the decision to join Juhudi Kilimo in order to access loans that would help her improve her farming activities. \n\nSometime this month, she applied for a loan for expanding her horticulture farm. This will enable her to expand her operations and increase her overall output. The additional income from the expansion will go to her children's education.

Pakpattan city is famous for its shrines. Many people come to visit the city of shrines. I feel I got a blessing from God to live in this city. I am a 58-year-old widow. My husband left me alone with three children. I have spent 15 years as a widow. I worked hard to give my children a good future. I sew clothes day and night and earn income. I invest some of my income in a committee. Through that amount I opened a grocery shop for my son. Now his business is going well. My eldest daughter reads in the 10th standard (grade) and my younger daughter reads in the 9th standard. My children feel proud of me, and I thank God that he helped me with all the problems. I am applying for a loan to diversify my son\u2019s grocery shop by buying more types of groceries. \r\n\r\nI am a group leader of a few more members in the locality. Anwar baji and Shakooran baji each want a loan to buy chairs for their barbershops. Manzooran baji and Nasreen baji each want a loan to buy groceries for their grocery shops. \r\n\r\nThis is a group loan. The loan funds will be distributed among the group members, each of whom will invest in her own business. The members mutually guarantee one another's loans.

Her friends supported her business aspirations because they live in circumstances similar to hers, and their brother helps them by taking the livestock to market on Saturdays.  \r\n\r\nZumratoi buys livestock feed on credit.  Her brother-in-law has decided to help out, while she takes care of the day-to-day care of the livestock.  Every three to four months they take the cattle to market and sell them at a profit.

He is 43 years old, is married and has three children.  Nasrullo is the oldest son in the family and lives with his parents.  His family is large and he needs to work a lot in order to provide for his family.  He is a private taxi driver.  Nasrullo has a van that he uses as a taxi.  His car is currently broken, which keeps him from working.  This is why he decided to take out a loan in order to purchase auto parts and make repairs.  He will be able to pay back the loan over 12 months.  \r\n\r\nIn addition to driving a taxi, Nasrullo also has an orchard where he grows grapes.  This gives him additional income during harvest season.  \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Russian by Sabina Holzman, Kiva

It was the location for the end of Alexander the Great's rule, and is known for its great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country, with its epic mountain passes, is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mix of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the USSR, damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 per cent of the country is mountainous and only 7 per cent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands of people to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \n\nMore about IMON International \n Since December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  Today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n\r\nTajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged an already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still lives in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Meet Agnes, 27 years of age, a very hardworking, honest and dedicated farmer who lives in Kaptumo, a remote village in Nandihills area of Kenya. She is happily married and is blessed with adorable children. She has been practicing mixed farming for the last five years and has gained a great deal of experience. To afford a decent and comfortable life for her children, she has been selling milk, eggs, and varieties of food crops from her farmland. To make ends meet and make extra cash, she has been engaging in another small personal business. The Nandihills area is very populated, and the demand for poultry products and eggs is very high. Like many farmers from her region, she finds poultry farming very enjoyable, and she stated that the most enjoyable part about poultry farming is \u201cthe increased profits I enjoy.\u201d Her biggest challenge, however, is meeting the demand that is really high. She lacks funds to increase her poultry farming, and she is seeking a loan of 40,000 KES (Kenyan shillings) to buy poultry. Being a woman seeking to access funds is very challenging, but through institutions such as Juhudi Kilimo via KIVA, she feels relieved knowing that her dream will be achieved and that she will be able to buy more poultry. As a result of the loan, she will sell more eggs and poultry products to her neighbors and to the local market and this will translate to an increased profit margin and an improved income level. Being a visionary woman, she intends to accumulate more profits and expand her poultry market to other markets; this will increase her income and improve her living conditions. The extra income she will get will be used to fully repay the loan, permanently change her living conditions, and secure the future of her two school-going children.\nShe hopes to sell more poultry during the festive season be part of that dream by granting her a loan!\n"}},"status":"inactive","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":2033228,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy poultry","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Nandi Hills","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Agnes","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-11-26T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":40000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":2830.92},{"due_date":"2016-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":2913.65},{"due_date":"2016-02-26T08:00:00Z","amount":2998.8},{"due_date":"2016-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":3086.44},{"due_date":"2016-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":3176.65},{"due_date":"2016-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":3269.48},{"due_date":"2016-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":3365.03},{"due_date":"2016-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":3463.38},{"due_date":"2016-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":3564.59},{"due_date":"2016-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":3668.77},{"due_date":"2016-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":3775.99},{"due_date":"2016-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":3886.3}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.31},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.14},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.99},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.86},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.77},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.69},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.65},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.63},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.65},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.69},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.76},{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.86}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":992609,"name":"Rolando","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rolando makes good earning on her farming activities in Mahayag.

Recognized by the people of the neighborhood as a serious man, Zakhiriddin would like to expand his crop into a viable source of income. In order to do that, he needs a loan of US $800 to buy fertilizer to expand his crop. The income from it will then help him to cope with the needs of his large family and educate all his children with higher education. Zakhiriddin is very grateful to everyone who is helping him to achieve his dreams with this loan.  \r\n<P>\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n<P>\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and with it\u2019s famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n<P>\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n<P>\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists, and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New Western culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

Oyungerel is 42 years old and lives with her husband and two sons in Gobi-Altai province, Mongolia. She and her family live in a ger, which is a traditional Mongolian housing tent. Her sons, ages 20 and 19, are both university students. Oyngerel operates a grocery and dairy trading business with the help of her husband. She operates her business from a rented stall and sells a variety of food and local dairy products. Oyungerel started her business in 2000 with a loan of 300,000 tugrugs (~210 USD) from Xacbank, Kiva's Mongolian MFI. Her business has grown quickly over the years and she has gained much business experience. Her earnings have enabled her to buy a car for her family and rent an additional stall at a local trading center. Oyungerel is focused on continuing her success in the future and says, \"I am working hard to support my family and raise my children to be responsible people.\" She is requesting a 1,500,000 tugrug (~1050 USD) loan to purchase vegetables to sell in her business. \r\n\r\n\r\nAbout XacBank\r\nXacBank was founded in 2001, and listed its first loan on Kiva in January 2009. It is the largest microfinance organization in Mongolia, but also has mainstream commercial operations. XacBank has the vision, scale and innovation to develop and implement new solutions to poverty. It is currently utilizing Kiva\u2019s 0% lending interest rate to return 9% of interest paid from borrowers to them in the form of a savings account at the end of their loans.

She lives in her own home along with her husband Artemio, 54, and their three minor children for whom she wishes to provide a better quality of life. Domitila works in the cultivation of coffee and bananas. Every day, very early in the morning, she works in her field, knowing that the money she obtains for her products will depend heavily on the quality of her harvest. She sells her products in Pichanaki, where better prices are offered. What she enjoys most about her work is the harvest, since it is then that she feels that the months of labor have come to fruition. She has worked in this business for three years and the most challenging part of her work is fumigating her land as the chemicals are damaging to her health. In time she hopes to buy new land and in this way increase her production. This is her second loan with MFP. She feels that this contribution will help her greatly in the progress of her work. In her Communal Bank she is deeply loved by the rest of the members, since she is highly supportive of them. With the 2,000 soles she is requesting, she will buy more natural and chemical fertilizers to improve the quality of her land. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Margaret Wolfe-Roberts, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":548593,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To purchase natural and chemical fertilizers to improve the quality of the land","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-06-08T17:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":725,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Domitila ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-05-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":725}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":725,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:38:15Z","rounded_local_amount":2062.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201326755}],"funded_date":"2010-06-09T04:08:56Z","paid_date":"2011-04-15T11:38:15Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Meg Wolfe-Roberts","image":555476}},{"id":209150,"name":"Phally","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Phally S.

He has a very traditional business:  he is dedicated to beekeeping, and also to buying pigs and cows to then sell in parts.  The animal is sacrificed, removing the skin, viscera, hooves and head, to later weigh and sell per pound.  Miguel initially dedicated himself to farming and raising livestock in the Montes de Mar\u00eda, where he learned the trade.  The situation he faced obligated him to leave his lands, to which he returned three years ago, but to instead tend to bees with some friends and to sell meats as he has a customer base in San Jacinto.\r\n\r\nThis is his first loan with the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  With part of the loan, he will buy pigs and cows, foods that homemakers use a great deal to prepare special dishes for this coming holiday season.  He will use the other part of the loan to buy materials for honey producing beehives, such as frames, sheets of wax, boxes, and roofs.  His dream, and that of his wife, is to educate their daughters who are currently 6 and 12 years old, so that they can have a successful future as professionals.  He would also like to continue growing his business until he earns enough to have his own house and for the well-being of his family.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":850,"image":{"id":625371,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Butcher

She has worked in the countryside her whole life and thanks to what her parents taught her she has been able to take care of herself doing this.  When she married, she and her husband built their house with their hard work in order to give their children well-being.  In this way she has been able to form her current business which is the sale of animals, among others, the sale of cows and bulls which at the end of the time needed to reach a certain weight are sold in a livestock market or to a slaughterhouse where they receive good profits.  Looking forward, she would like to have a stable where she could house more animals and thus grow her working capital.  She is one of the most committed members as she has chosen to request a loan with MFP and already has nine opportunities on her record to show her ability to make punctual payments.  As such she has invested her past loans well and has been able to grow her business sustainably.

They have been doing this work together for more than two years.  Ruth learned this work thanks to her mother, since she always did this work.  Ruth had to abandon her university studies in her third year of studying psychology because of lack of resources.  Because of this she started raising livestock, to have a source of income.\r\n\r\nShe buys the livestock on the outskirts of the community where she lives.  When someone tells her they have livestock for sale, she goes and negotiates for it; she buys it if it seems good to her.  Once bought, she has to take it to her house on foot through the street.  When she acquires the animal in the city, she walks some five kilometers from the place she buys it to her house.\r\n\r\nRuth is requesting a loan from the Campo Foundation to buy livestock to raise.  If she buys heifers, she will buy three; but if she decides to buy dairy cows, she will buy only one, since they are more expensive than heifers.  With the loan she is trying to to increase the milk production and in this way be able to process it to sell dairy products.  She has seen the opportunity to have good income, since people are already looking for dairy products at her house and she doesn't have them available yet.\r\n\r\nRuth's plan for the future is to make improvements to her house, depending on the production and raising of her livestock.  She wants to plaster the walls and improve the porch and the roof, since there are various leaks in the winter.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":879399,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy livestock.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Gotera","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2011-09-27T20:50:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":800,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ruth Damaris","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-09-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":800,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":800}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":800}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":101.25,"local_amount":101.25,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:28:53Z","rounded_local_amount":101.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263317638},{"amount":624.78,"local_amount":624.78,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T09:24:18Z","rounded_local_amount":624.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270033199},{"amount":73.97,"local_amount":73.97,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:57:12Z","rounded_local_amount":73.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301390852}],"funded_date":"2011-09-28T03:56:21Z","paid_date":"2012-09-15T09:57:12Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Catharine Wall","image":1532414}},{"id":344402,"name":"Sreysros","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sreysros (in the photo) is single.

Because of the good relationship she has with her neighbors, she plans to increase her market by using word of mouth to reach more customers and markets.

Thanks to his daughter\u2019s assistance, he is able to care and feed the animals for sale later at both fairs and marketplaces in nearby towns.  Traveling to nearby towns increases his costs, but that is offset by the higher asking price he gets there.  For this reason Esteban and his daughter take care to feed them properly in order to bring in more profit.  Nevertheless, they would now like to increase the number of guinea pigs, as well as buy pigs and chickens, so in the future they might go into animal husbandry full-time, as it is a more profitable business that agriculture.

Her husband is a chauffeur.  Maura hopes to get increased financing for her business so that she has more working capital to carry out her plans.  She dreams of the institution growing large enough to overcome the country's poverty.\r\n\r\nShe sells cosmetics as a street vendor, a business she has had for 2 years.  She started it as a neighborhood store and kept that for about 2 years.  But because Maura is a hospital nurse and the store was her second source of income, she could not maintain it because she was tired after work.  She decided to sell cosmetics, and with this business she finds the means to meet her obligations.  This loan is for working capital so she can buy products from various merchants.

Nabi is 40 years old, married and the loving father of five children. For eight years, Nabi has been raising cattle and growing crops on his land with his wife, who we see here. He is now planning to sow wheat on his two-hectare plot. He wants to borrow money to buy fertilizer, fuels and lubricants to increase his yield. He also wants to use part of the loan to buy more cattle. To make all of this possible, Nabi is asking for a loan of $725 for eight months. You could become an important part of the Nabi family's life, and he deeply appreciates the trust and support Kiva lenders are giving him.\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, Western culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. Civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

Unfortunately she became a widow when she was only 30 years old with three young children. She had to be strong and work hard to bring up her children properly. Her husband died in a work accident and since then she has been living alone with her three sons (21, 19, 16). The oldest has finished professional studies as a public accountant, one has started studying odontology and the youngest is in school. Therefore Mrs. Rosmery has to work hard until her two sons finish their studies.\r\n<p>\r\nThe family lives in the town of Cochabamba in the neighborhood of Maica Central. For a living she produces fresh milk for a dairy product factory. At the moment she has 10 milking cows.\r\n<p>\r\nThe loan will be spent on buying forage, which is important for the good diet for the cattle to continue with the production of the same quantity of milk.\r\n<p>\r\nThe most important of her goals is that her 2 sons finish their professional studies and increase the milk production in order to save money for her old age.\r\n\r\n  \r\n<br

Margret is 19 years old and lives in the town of Mukono in the Mukono region of Uganda.  She is single and has no children Margret has had a business selling food like matooke and sweet potatoes for two years.  \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Margret has requested a loan of 200,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda.  The loan will be used to purchase more food.  With the help of the loan from BRAC, Margret hopes to generate greater profits, sometimes to buy food and to take care of herself.  In the future, Margret hopes to own a house.    \r\n\r\nNote to lenders: BRAC Uganda has recently begun posting a new loan product to Kiva, which funds young entrepreneurs in BRAC\u2019s Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program.  This Kiva borrower is receiving a new ELA loan. The ELA program first provides disadvantaged adolescents, usually girls who are out of school, with livelihood training and financial literacy skills.  Afterward, ELA participants can receive microfinance loans to expand their small businesses.  These loans offer adolescents a unique chance to access finance at a young age and improve their prospects for the future, and target a segment of the population not typically served by traditional microfinance.  Kiva is privileged to partner with BRAC Uganda in posting these new loans, and give Kiva lenders the opportunity to fund deserving young entrepreneurs and support a promising new sector in

He earns his living by operating three business ventures: motorcycle operator, buy and sell of livestock and charcoal. His wife, Helen M., who is 40 years old, works as a housewife and helps her husband in the business activities.  They have two children who are 13 and 20 years old. John Deere joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2006 because he aspired for something better for his family. With the help of his past three loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, John Deere has been incrementally lifting his family out of poverty by the sweat of his brow. His previous loan of PHP 19,500 helped him earn a monthly profit of PHP 8,800, thus uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for his fourth loan, he is borrowing PHP 29,500, which he intends to use to fund his business operations so that he could continue to save up for the future of his family and the business. John Deere M. is a Dungganon man who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of his dreams.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She does her work from home everyday but on weekends she takes them to the local market to sell to the traditional clothing merchants. This is why every day she has to get ahead in order to have more clothing to sell. For her it is key to always have her materials available. On the other hand, she raises pigs that she sells after 3 months in the livestock fair of her community. She states that she likes to work more with the embroidery because it doesn't require as much physical strength but does require a lot of creativity. Also, it doesn't have any losses, because she doesn't have to pay for feed. For now, she will take advantage of the area's festivities since there will be more demand for the clothes she sells. She states that she likes to work with the group from MFP as she has done for 12 work cycles during which she has had a good payment record as she will continue to have in the future.

This is 59-year-old Alice from Mutare. She is married and is living with one child, who is attending school. She also cares for two dependents.\n\nAlice runs a retail business selling electrical gadgets (fridges, tvs and radios) and clothes. The business has been in operation for 8 years.
