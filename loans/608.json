Although she says that she has challenges, like transportation costs and inconsistency in the quality clothes, she is able to make a 150,000 profit per week. This is attributed to her good customer care skills and the availability of stock due to her loans. She hopes to become a wholesale supplier and build a house for her children as their mother.

Her business lets her earn a profit of PHP 11,000 per month.  \r\n\r\nNow with your help, she would like to apply for a PHP 8,000 loan. This amount will be used as a source of added capital to her expanding business by buying additional stocks like snacks, soft drinks, and other household commodities.\r\n\r\nShe prays that her business will continue to be blessed by God so that she can support her son until he graduates from college and have a better life in the future.  \r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

They have 4 children together, but only one still lives with them, in the house they own.  Despite diverse family and financial problems, she found the strength to forge ahead.  For this reason, three years ago, she started selling a variety of refreshments along with egg and cheese sandwiches and hamburgers.  Meanwhile, her husband works as a moto-taxi driver.  With these activities, they manage to bring in 45.00 Peruvian soles each day, and with this income they support the education of their youngest child and pay for their household expenses.\r\n\r\nThe aspect she enjoys most about her work is selling her products.  She offers samples of her food as a marketing strategy.  For now, she wants to prioritize by purchasing edible products and sweets to supply her stand, since she conducts her business in an ambulatory manner.  This is her sixth credit with MFP.  She feels her progress began once she started working with the other members, who she respects and values a great deal.  She is an active participant in the group.  She will use the loan she is requesting to buy candy, cookies, sweets, and sodas.     \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Mary Lynn Malaby, Kiva

","en":"This group is called De Esmeralda. It is located in Mexico state. The group is formed by 9 members. Maria Araceli Casta\u00f1eda is the president of the group. She is 30 years old, is a businesswoman, and has two children: a boy and a girl. She sells coats and jackets, an activity she began 9 years ago with a small fruit cocktail stand outside of the community's school, asking the children for help when charging because she did not know how to add or subtract. Since her sales were good, she continued saving and bought clothes and because she is a good saleswoman, her neighbors had her bring them sheets and bedspreads, which she sold in batches or monthly payments. <p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHer husband works in a factory and also helps her sell along with her coworkers. Ms. Araceli is very enthusiastic and never gives up although on occasion her sales have dropped very much. She always tells her husband \"a peso earned is worth more than one thousand robbed.\" She is seeking this loan to invest in jackets and coats which she sells a lot of in this season and grow her sales and her business so that in the future she can give her children a high quality education who she hopes to be good professionals and not be like her, who learned arithmetic with much difficulty.

This time, for her 25th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 20,000 to buy a freezer for her fish. She is convinced that she can continue building a second story on her house and provide higher education to all her children.

Their ages are 23, 21, 18 and 16. She lives in the village  of Manjacaze, located in the district of the same name. She owns a tailoring business that offers services through special orders. She joined the credit program in 2004 as a group member but that group was dismantled and she decided to stay in the program solely. Her business has shown signs of growth: when she first started, she only had one sewing machine to work with. Now she has added a second machine and she has hired an assistant. With the loan amount, she will purchase a third machine and add a second helper to her staff because demand is expected to rise significantly once the school year starts and parents will be looking to purchase uniforms for their children. All of Irene's children are in secondary school and her dream is to be able to afford a college education for them. To accomplish this dream, which is also the whole family's dream, she will have to double her efforts. Irene's husband does not have a regular job, he makes his living by doing informal work and that is how he helps with the family's expenses. That is why she has to work extra hard so that her family does not lack anything. Irene travels once a month to purchase material in Maputo. She can get them there relatively cheaper than in Manjacaze, where she lives and does her work. She spends 340,00 Mt to travel back and forth from Maputo.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Portuguese by Bertolt Cantalice, Kiva Volunteer<\/p>\r\n\r\nIrene e mdosta, solteira mas vive com um homem com quem tem 4 filhos de 23, 21, 18 e 16 anos de idade.

Its history also includes famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others.   \r\n<p>\r\nThe country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And even today it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.  But Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still lives in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\nIMON's History\r\n<p>\r\n\u2028Since December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition.  Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

For the past ten years, Agn\u00e8s has been living in Takon A\u00efdj\u00e8do, a district of Porto-Novo, the administrative capital of Benin. Married to Barth\u00e9l\u00e9my Zanmenou, who sells gasoline, Agn\u00e8s is the mother of four children. The children are of school age and attend school. The couple supports their family together. Agn\u00e8s has never gone to school and has for the last eight years been in the business of transforming palm oil and preparing akassa (a local food made from corn starch) from home. Agn\u00e8s stocks up in Takon and at the Ouando market in Porto-Novo and sells her products at the Ouando market. Agn\u00e8s is a former client of Alid\u00e9 and has already benefitted from two loans, which she has repaid. In order to increase her business in order to save, Agn\u00e8s is seeking a third loan with Alid\u00e9.

The rest of her children are young. (They range from three to seven years old.) To support their basic, everyday needs and to sustain the education of Jonel, Josette decided to put up her own small business, hog fattening. Profit from her hogs, which are sold after three to four months of raising, is used to purchase better kinds of food and other necessary things for her family to enjoy. Josette realized that her hog fattening business earns fairly well. Therefore she wants to raise more hogs and to sell them to the market either alive or slaughtered in a larger volume to increase her revenue. In this case, she is requesting a bigger loan through ASHI. \r\n\r\nJosette and her husband are excited to see her business grow and become stable. They are whimsical about having a better kind of life for their children through the success of their

Nabulao, Sipalay City, Negros Occidental. She operates a balut-making business as one of her main source of income. Her husband Bartolome, who is 45 years old is a farmer but also helps in his wife's business activities. They have 2 teenage children who are still going to school. \r\n\r\nGrace joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2004 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 9 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Grace has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 15000 which she added to her own capital helped her increase her monthly profit to PHP 25000,  uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 10th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 19000, which she intends to use to buy more duck's eggs which she will incubate to balut, cook and sell in the community so that she could continue to save up for future improvement of business and to send children to school. Grace B. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She is a merchant and has seven children, three girls and four boys. She sells clothing and also runs a stationery store. She started ten years ago with a small amount of clothing; her customers paid in installments. The business was funded through a neighbourhood savings bank. Sales were good, and Felipa invested part of her income in the business, and part for food. Thanks to her business skills and responsible attitude, she was able to expand the business, and her neighbours invited her to form part of their group.\r\n\r\nIt was difficult for Felipa to make progress as her husband was sick; however, she left her husband in the care of her children and went to work.

","en":"Luis, 38, lives on the outskirts of Guayaquil in a neighborhood called Orquideas (so called because of the many orchids that used to grow there).  He is married and has two children: a 10-year old son who is in elementary school and an 8-month old baby.  Luis operates a business making and selling churros (a pretzel-like snack).  \r\n\r\nLuis started making churros for a living when he was a young man.  After he married, he bought a food cart to help him grow the business.  He and his wife get up very early to make the churros and have them ready for the street vendors who help with sales.  He will spend $700 of this loan to buy bulk supplies of flour and $100 to buy other supplies that he needs for his business.  For the future, he wants to make improvements to his house so that he can give his children a decent place to grow up."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":779392,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Catering","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy supplies for his food sales business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Guayaquil (Orquideas)","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":147,"posted_date":"2011-05-28T15:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":800,"lender_count":26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Luis Antonio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-05-04T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":800,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":58.6},{"due_date":"2011-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":60.43},{"due_date":"2011-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":61.24},{"due_date":"2011-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":62.59},{"due_date":"2011-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":64.37},{"due_date":"2011-11-04T07:00:00Z","amount":65.4},{"due_date":"2011-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":67.15},{"due_date":"2012-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":68.33},{"due_date":"2012-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":69.84},{"due_date":"2012-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":71.7},{"due_date":"2012-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":72.97},{"due_date":"2012-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":77.38}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.6},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.43},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.24},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.59},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":64.37},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65.4},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":67.15},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.33},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.84},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.7},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.97},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.38}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":58.6,"local_amount":58.6,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T10:40:55Z","rounded_local_amount":58.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216460247},{"amount":60.43,"local_amount":60.43,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:23:33Z","rounded_local_amount":60.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221624072},{"amount":61.24,"local_amount":61.24,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T08:36:26Z","rounded_local_amount":61.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":226993348},{"amount":62.59,"local_amount":62.59,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-23T07:42:12Z","rounded_local_amount":62.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232752410},{"amount":64.37,"local_amount":64.37,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-19T08:50:08Z","rounded_local_amount":64.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238556551},{"amount":65.4,"local_amount":65.4,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:24:53Z","rounded_local_amount":65.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244515543},{"amount":67.15,"local_amount":67.15,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T09:31:22Z","rounded_local_amount":67.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250723233},{"amount":68.22,"local_amount":68.22,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T09:42:21Z","rounded_local_amount":68.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257126096},{"amount":69.95,"local_amount":69.95,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T08:45:23Z","rounded_local_amount":69.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263251161},{"amount":144.67,"local_amount":144.67,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T08:40:50Z","rounded_local_amount":144.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":269976105},{"amount":77.38,"local_amount":77.38,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T08:55:25Z","rounded_local_amount":77.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276582929}],"funded_date":"2011-06-08T09:58:53Z","paid_date":"2012-05-15T08:55:25Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jere Wiseman","image":30736}},{"id":307158,"name":"Vestine","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Vestine is 29 years old, married, and has two children, one of whom attends school.

She leads a group of 15 members who know each other because they live in the same neighborhood. The majority of the members are working women who leave their homes to seek out better opportunities to help their families get ahead. They work in different sectors, such as baking, clothing sales, footwear sales, public transport, service sector, construction, coca sales, food sales, and grocery sales. They are responsible people with the desire to progress, as demonstrated in past work with the foundation. This is their fourth loan cycle, and they've added new people to the group. However they know that these people are responsible and they meet the expectations of the experienced members. The loan will go toward supplies, materials, and tools for these small businesses. For example, the money will buy more materials to sell and will improve some of the products, especially during the Christmas season when sales are higher. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from

Elmira and her husband are raising three children. Their eldest son is 19.  He has already got on his feet and he lives and works in Bishkek. The middle son is a college student. And the little daughter goes to elementary school. Elmira and her husband always strive to give their children a good upbringing, so that their children grow up hardworking and diligent. To provide for the family and pay for the children\u2019s education, Elmira\u2019s husband works as a builder. As for Elmira, she manufactures traditional handicrafts. She wants to get herself a spot at the market and start selling the articles at the market. She got this idea after consulting her relatives, who believe in Elmira\u2019s skill and the profitability of this business. When Elmira first started sewing national articles, she invested 350$. Her expense was worth it, as in a very short time Elmira began receiving orders. Her success has encouraged her to expand her business and start selling the articles in a shop. Since then, she has been nurturing this idea in her soul and making preparations. Now everything is ready. She just needs some funds to purchase fabric. Therefore, Elmira has applied for this loan to start her business, steadily grow and become an independent entrepreneur. She also says that this business would let her give a better education to her daughter.\r\n\r\nElmira\u2019s partners are Batima, Cholponbai and Elnura.\r\n\r\nBatima, 46, is divorced. She is a mother of five children. Only her little daughter and son live with Batima. For a living, Batima sells potatoes. She hopes to obtain this loan and invest it in purchasing potatoes. \r\n\r\nCholponbai, 23, married very early and now has a six-year old son. His wife trades in socks at the market. Cholponbai trades in cattle. He needs a loan to invest in increasing the turnover.\r\n\r\nElnura, 25, is single. After graduating from college, Elnura decided to start trading in cattle. Now, she has a stable income and needs a loan to purchase calves.\r\n\r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance, a young and ambitious socially-focused MFI in Kyrgyzstan.\r\n\r\nMol Bulak Finance is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development on the basis of the 3-Ps concept - People (building human capital and taking care of its customers and the society as well), Profit (to be profitable to grow further) and the Planet (taking care of the environment).

She is 34 years old. Joan is married and has one school-aged child. To make a living, Joan owns and operates a gown for rent business. While not the only means of generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from providing rentals for gowns and barongs in the local community. Aside from that, she is also managing a catering business. Joan has been engaged in her businesses for over 14 years and earns approximately 10,000 PHP a month for these activities.\n\nIn 2010, Joan joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Joan is requesting a new loan of 30,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional inventory and working capital. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Joan from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business. \n\nAbout ASKI:\n\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs. \n\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":475425,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"To purchase additional inventory and working capital","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Taggappan Echague","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":123,"posted_date":"2010-01-27T05:20:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":650,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Joan","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-01-14T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":30000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":5000},{"due_date":"2010-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":5000},{"due_date":"2010-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":5000},{"due_date":"2010-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":5000},{"due_date":"2010-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":5000},{"due_date":"2010-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":5000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":108.33},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":108.34},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":108.33},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":108.33},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":108.34},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":108.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":25.31,"local_amount":1168,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T10:12:10Z","rounded_local_amount":1169.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118015910},{"amount":137.19,"local_amount":6332,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T08:18:12Z","rounded_local_amount":6341.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123853434},{"amount":54.17,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2010-03-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T07:58:51Z","rounded_local_amount":2503.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128886799},{"amount":108.33,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2010-04-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T09:37:39Z","rounded_local_amount":5007.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136615295},{"amount":108.33,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2010-05-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T08:37:27Z","rounded_local_amount":5007.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144649525},{"amount":108.34,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2010-06-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:06:17Z","rounded_local_amount":5007.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151830892},{"amount":108.33,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2010-07-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T09:08:04Z","rounded_local_amount":5007.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159570612}],"funded_date":"2010-01-27T06:30:37Z","paid_date":"2010-08-15T09:08:04Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Eva van Emden","image":1021631}},{"id":175624,"name":"Tusitukire Wamu Group, Lugazi","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"N.

Not having gone to school, she started selling things early on with her mother, who sold millet and rice cakes (called Takoula).

In addition to this business, which she has been in for 9 years, she also sells construction wood.\r\n\r\nIn order to build up her stock for the rainy season, when there will be a millet shortage, she has decided to seek a new loan from Soro Yiriwaso, with whom she has had a relationship for 54 months and has had 3 group loans and 3 individual loans, all of which were repaid. This fourth individual loan will be used to buy ten bags of millet. She stocks up on the premises. Mrs. Kadia Kon\u00e9 sells for cash and credit to a clientele composed of men and women.

She is 30 years old. Fely is separated from her spouse and has 2 school-aged children. To make a living, Fely owns and operates a business venture in the retail sector running a sari-sari (variety) shop. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling both food and daily use products in the local community.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is 40 years old, she studies until the 6th grade, she is married and has 3 kids that are her own and 1 adopted kid. Her children are named Jorge, Esli and Gabriel. Jorge is 11 years old,  Esli is 6 years old and Gabriel is 3 years old. Jorge and Esli are  both currently in elementary school. Antonia's adopted daughter, Azucena, is 17 years old, is married and has a son.\n\nSe\u00f1ora Antonia has a sewing workshop and requests the loan to invest in raw materials for the workshop.  She will buy yarn, needles, oil, closures, springs, parts, fringe, scissors, fabric, lace, ribbon.  She offers her customers aprons in 4 different styles which she makes and sells.  She sometimes makes uniforms for the elementary school and sports uniforms for basketball.  She also has silk screen and printing services.  She prepares napkins for quincea\u00f1eros (girls' 15th birthday parties), baptisms, and first communions.  She started her business 11 years ago, before which she used to work in a sewing workshop making decorative baby items, like diaper bags, crib veils, and linings for baby carriers, which were produced for Liverpool department store.  She inherited a small space of 50 square meters from her father, which is where she has her workshop.  She started with loans and the industrial machines and silk-screen printing were bought from the liquidation of the sewing workshop where she had worked.   Her business is located at her home in Tlayecac.  Se\u00f1ora Antonia participated in a statewide sewing contest where there were 31 participants from several places.  She won first prize, and with it bought 2 industrial machines. \n\nHer business is important and special as she is able to sustain herself financially.  It is a source of work for her family as her husband sells the aprons that Antonia manufactures, and her adopted daughter also works with her.  She is proud to make the aprons. She started with 8 plastic aprons that could be used for doing the washing without getting wet.  She made these with pieces of left-over plastic that the lady where she worked gave her.  Her husband went to sell them, and they wound up going very fast.  With what she made from the sale she bought more plastic and was able to grow her customers.  Her customers are varied, and she makes aprons in bulk for the tortilla makers, the butchers, the taco makers. \n\nA challenge facing the business is the climate, as dust enters because the workshop is not finished.   It lacks ironwork, a door, and glass in the windows. The business profits are reinvested, used for food, for repaying the loan and for household expenses. She is planning to expand her workshop.  She wants to buy a computerized embroidery machine and a machine for making buttonholes, and she thinks that with saving and the loan she will be  able to complete this.  The improvements she wants to make to her home are ironwork for her workshop, plastering and putting in glass on the second floor, and tiling the bathroom to expand the workshop.  She sometimes employs more people in the month of December, when she has more work.  She dreams of a having a full workshop and employing more people.  She is very excited about this loan that will be provided, because if she knows how to manage it things will go better for her and she can grow her workshop.  What she wants for the future of her children is that they consider a career or job, and if they like sewing, she will teach them her craft. \n\nShe likes Tlayecac because it was where she was born and raised and the people are very pleasant.  During the rainy season the hill becomes green and the gully grows vegetation.  There are small birds and fungi, and you can go to the countryside for some peace and quiet. \n\nShe wants to tell Kiva and Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad, \"Thank you for giving me the loan because through this I will expand my business, work in my home and be employed.  I can tend to my children with my own business  Thank you very much.\""}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":825,"image":{"id":662234,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"Buying raw materials, yarn, needles, oil, closures, springs, parts, fringes, scissors, fabric, lace, ribbon","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"TLAYECAC MORELOS","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2010-12-20T20:00:13Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":825,"lender_count":30,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Antonia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-12-06T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":825,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2011-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2011-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2011-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2011-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2011-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":1250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":103.13},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":103.12},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":103.13},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":103.12},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":103.13},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":103.12},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":103.13},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":103.12}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":103.13,"local_amount":1250,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T13:17:41Z","rounded_local_amount":1280.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188691528},{"amount":103.12,"local_amount":1250,"processed_date":"2011-01-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T03:44:09Z","rounded_local_amount":1280.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191430711},{"amount":103.13,"local_amount":1250,"processed_date":"2011-01-17T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T03:44:12Z","rounded_local_amount":1280.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191430712},{"amount":103.12,"local_amount":1250,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T03:44:57Z","rounded_local_amount":1280.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191430713},{"amount":245.18,"local_amount":2971.88,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:44:55Z","rounded_local_amount":3043.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195849986},{"amount":167.32,"local_amount":2028.12,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:10:12Z","rounded_local_amount":2077.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201292258}],"funded_date":"2010-12-20T23:18:04Z","paid_date":"2011-04-15T11:10:12Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Arabella Pollack","image":null}},{"id":262097,"name":"Khana Naira Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La B.C. \u201cKHANA NAIRA\u201d ( en idioma aymara \u201cojos claros\u201d) iniciar\u00e1 el ciclo n\u00famero  uno en Pro Mujer, como parte del Centro Focal de Los Andes.

She lives with her husband and two children who attend a local state school. Since 1998, she has earned a living by cultivating a rice crop.

With this loan she plans to buy simple grains, cereals and bottled milk, among other things, to help stock her stand.  Her plan is to remodel her home so that she can install a small store and provide better service to her customers and thus, provide an education for her children.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ian Nicoll, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":271847,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Market","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Buy Grains and Cereals","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Managua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.150833 -86.268333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":98,"posted_date":"2009-03-02T23:10:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":300,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Adela ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-02-10T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":6000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2009-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2009-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2009-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2009-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2009-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":50.35,"local_amount":1006.98,"processed_date":"2009-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T09:09:26Z","rounded_local_amount":1014.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27039002},{"amount":50.28,"local_amount":1005.76,"processed_date":"2009-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T09:47:39Z","rounded_local_amount":1013.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35929295},{"amount":50.38,"local_amount":1007.65,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T20:24:34Z","rounded_local_amount":1015.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44384201},{"amount":50.09,"local_amount":1001.87,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T16:33:10Z","rounded_local_amount":1009.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52890659},{"amount":50.17,"local_amount":1003.37,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T09:39:10Z","rounded_local_amount":1011.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63111960},{"amount":48.73,"local_amount":974.37,"processed_date":"2009-08-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T09:43:46Z","rounded_local_amount":981.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73533366}],"funded_date":"2009-03-03T03:26:21Z","paid_date":"2009-09-15T09:43:46Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ian Nicoll","image":635984}},{"id":93276,"name":"Chhay","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"S. is 36 years old and lives in Siem Reap Province.

He is very attentive and concerned, and he has a great desire to shape a good future for himself. Everyday, he leaves his house with his van (VW bus) at around 5 in the morning because he has to wait for his transportation line to give him the orders to leave. His route is number 19, which is one of the most difficult ones to cover because of the large amount of passengers and the bad road conditions, so he has to make a big effort. What Victor most likes is driving, which is why he decided to buy a VW bus (which he is still using) at age 25 with the help of his parents. He thinks that the most difficult part of his job is dealing with people who do not want to pay, or who pay a less than the normal fare. Even so, he knows that this is his job and he has to give it his all. This is his first loan with MFP, and he is very happy for this opportunity to receive one because he is planning to invest it well. He is a very well-respected member of his microfinance institute because he always establishes order in the group.

Su actividad econ\u00f3mica es la venta de cosm\u00e9ticos, lo cual realiza a domicilio y en las calles, por lo que en ocasiones aprovecha las ferias de su ciudad para ofrecer los productos que tiene en stock.

Lo que m\u00e1s le gusta de su trabajo es la amistad que hace con sus clientas, pues en sus horas de visita siempre tiene un tiempo para dialogar con ellas. En estos cuatro a\u00f1os como promotora de ventas considera que lo m\u00e1s dif\u00edcil es salir a las calles y realizar las cobranzas, debido a que algunas clientas se retrasan en sus pagos perjudicando su capital de trabajo.

She lives in her own home and her greatest wish is to be in a financial position to educate her daughter.  Her business is the sale of cosmetics out of her home and as a street vendor.  She offers her stock on hand for sale at town fairs; however, in general Yanetd deals in catalog sales.  \r\nThe customers that visit her most frequently are her neighbors and family members, because her great sense of humor has earned her their love. What she likes best about her job is the friendship that she has with her clients, and she always takes time to visit when they come calling. In the four years she has been in sales what has been most difficult is taking to the streets to collect payments, because some customers are behind on their payments and that is impacting her working capital.  In the future she would like to open a cosmetics shop in her home because it is a location that is already familiar to her customers. She is just in need of adequate space and display cases for her products. This is Yanetd's third loan with Microfinanzas PRISMA and membership in a community bank has helped her to improve her interpersonal relationships. With the 1000 Peruvian soles that she is requesting, Yanetd will buy products for sale in the catalogs in order to have more stock on hand.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Joyce ., Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":391690,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Increase merchandise","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-09-21T05:20:13Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Yanetd","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-09-03T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2009-11-02T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2009-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2010-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2010-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2010-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2010-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2010-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":125}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":43.75,"local_amount":125,"processed_date":"2009-10-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T02:59:01Z","rounded_local_amount":126.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96997566},{"amount":43.75,"local_amount":125,"processed_date":"2009-11-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:52:52Z","rounded_local_amount":126.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103842915},{"amount":131.25,"local_amount":375,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T15:24:59Z","rounded_local_amount":380.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734490},{"amount":43.75,"local_amount":125,"processed_date":"2010-03-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:32:27Z","rounded_local_amount":126.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128992442},{"amount":43.75,"local_amount":125,"processed_date":"2010-04-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:37:00Z","rounded_local_amount":126.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136717280},{"amount":43.75,"local_amount":125,"processed_date":"2010-05-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:39:10Z","rounded_local_amount":126.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144751037}],"funded_date":"2009-09-21T16:27:31Z","paid_date":"2010-06-15T09:39:10Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Joyce .","image":null}},{"id":142501,"name":"Rosana","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rosana is 41 years old  and married to Andres.

Her story is representative of her group and generally of Esperanza's Haitian and Dominican clients, many of whom recently emigrated to the Dominican Republic from Haiti. Her group is located in Puerto Plata, a port town on the North Coast with an economy dominated by tourism, where running water (none of which is potable) and electricity are unreliable. She makes her home here in a simple structure with her long-term partner and two children.\r\n\r\nFelicia is excited to be taking her second loan with Esperanza after having successfully repaid her previous loan and grown her business.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n \r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n \r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

Republic).  He is married and is raising four children.  Japaraly was born into a simple and large family of a farmer.  Since childhood, he helped his father to take care of a large farm, especially because his father also worked as a driver at the local collective farm and needed help to take care of livestock.  After graduating from school, Japaraly went to serve in the army.  In 1989, Japaraly got married after returning from the army and also started attending a retail college that same year.  He spent two years in college and then got a job as a salesperson at a department store, and then as a security guard at a meat processing plant.  At that time, Japaraly and his wife lived with the parents.  They decided to move out of the parents' home in 1993, and Japaraly and his family moved to their relatives' farm in the Sargo village (Panfilovsk district, Kyrgyzstan).  At that time, they already had two children.  Japaraly took care of his relatives' livestock and also increased the quantity of his own livestock at this same farm because it had suitable conditions for keeping and breeding livestock.  Having lived on this farm for six years and increasing the quantity of his own livestock, Japaraly decided to return to live with the parents because he was their youngest son.  According to Kyrgyz traditions, the youngest son has to take care of his aging parents.  At that time, he had several dairy cows and calves.  In 2009, having sold some of the livestock, Japaraly bought a one-bedroom apartment in the town of Karabalta.  Currently, thanks to his entrepreneurship and persistence, Japaraly has two dairy cows, seven bulls and fifteen sheep.  In order to further expand his business, Japaraly requested a loan in the sum of 100,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company to buy livestock.  Japaraly plans to expand his farm.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2225,"image":{"id":889283,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase livestock","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Bukara village","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2011-10-07T16:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2225,"lender_count":73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Japaraly","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":100000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":2225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2012-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":35000},{"due_date":"2012-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":35000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":667.5},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":778.75},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":778.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":667.5,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T08:39:52Z","rounded_local_amount":30194.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":269975559},{"amount":778.75,"local_amount":35000,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T09:13:06Z","rounded_local_amount":35226.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308095350},{"amount":778.75,"local_amount":35000,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T10:19:36Z","rounded_local_amount":35226.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355754523}],"funded_date":"2011-11-04T16:34:22Z","paid_date":"2013-04-17T10:19:36Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Anna Sorokina","image":null}},{"id":348197,"name":"Solomon","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Solomon wants a loan to buy a motorcycle.

She is a friendly, hard-working and enterprising young woman. She is married to her husband, with whom she has a 2-year-old son. They live together in a home they own, working hard every day to provide the best for their young son and give the family a better quality of life. Jessica's job consists of preparing and selling ceviche (a traditional dish). She is co-owner of a ceviche restaurant in the city along with her mother, who owns 70 percent of the business. They work every day. The restaurant is run out of her mother's home, and Jessica leaves for work very early every day because she has to go to city's port in search of the freshest and highest quality fish. She started out as an assistant to her mother, but thanks to a lot of hard work she was able to take on more responsibilities and was given a percentage of the business. She has been working there for five years and it is going very well, enough for her to buy her home and accomplish many things. At first, things were complicated with the business, but now it's going very well and she has big plans for it to keep growing. Jessica, like every young woman, desires to move up in life. In the future she hopes to set up a hardware store in her home, but she knows it requires a much bigger investment. So for now she is dedicated to working hard every day and raising enough capital for her to be able to carry out her dream. This will be her second loan with Kiva partner MFP, and she is very content in knowing she will have financial support because she feels it will help her make strides with her work. She also promises once again to be very punctual with her payments, since she doesn't want to let down her fellow members of her community bank who but their trust in her and gave her support for the loan. With the loan she is requesting, Jessica plans to purchase ingredients and supplies to keep working and keep her customers satisfied by offering a wider variety of meals."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":923638,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to purchase ingredients and supplies to prepare her meals.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-11-21T09:30:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jessica ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-10-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":148.74},{"due_date":"2011-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":159.72},{"due_date":"2012-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":159.09},{"due_date":"2012-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":171.6},{"due_date":"2012-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":178.01},{"due_date":"2012-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":182.84}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.78},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.89},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.66},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.35},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.76},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.56}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":55.78,"local_amount":148.74,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:42:31Z","rounded_local_amount":150.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244622064},{"amount":59.89,"local_amount":159.72,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:51:41Z","rounded_local_amount":161.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250836167},{"amount":59.66,"local_amount":159.09,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:18:15Z","rounded_local_amount":161.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257245931},{"amount":64.35,"local_amount":171.6,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:27:42Z","rounded_local_amount":173.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270099044},{"amount":66.75,"local_amount":178.01,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T10:31:27Z","rounded_local_amount":180.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276713187},{"amount":68.57,"local_amount":182.84,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:28:15Z","rounded_local_amount":185.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283203210}],"funded_date":"2011-11-21T12:15:34Z","paid_date":"2012-06-15T18:28:15Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Marty Greenstein","image":null}},{"id":364593,"name":"Dairon Ezequiel","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Dairon Esequiel tiene 24 a\u00f1os de edad vive en uni\u00f3n libre tiene un hijo, vive con la esposa,  padres y el hijo en el Cant\u00f3n Ventanas Provincia de los r\u00edos.\nLa VRC JERUSALEN, se encuentra ubicada en el Recinto El caimito, Perteneciente a la Parroquia Puerto Pechiche Cant\u00f3n Pueblo Viejo, Esta Ventanilla se dedica a labores Agr\u00edcolas de ciclo Corto siembra de ma\u00edz, arroz, frejol Gandul.\nDairon se dedica a la Agricultura a la siembra de ma\u00edz, arroz hace 10 a\u00f1os las compras y las ventas los realiza en Ventanas.\nSolicita el cr\u00e9dito para la Agricultura ciclo corto de ma\u00edz, arroz.

With 80% of the population not having access to any kind of distributed electricity there was a lot of potential to improve people's lives by giving them access to basic electricity. Most people depend on car batteries and kerosene lights, which is inadequate, inefficient, labor intensive, and unsafe. \r\n\r\nNRG Solutions was established with the goal of providing sustainable, appropriate, and affordable solar energy solutions to Cambodia and S.E. Asia. Our team began working under the name Yejj Solar, as part of a larger NGO. This experience helped us learn about the local and regional market. We tested different models and approaches to the distribution of solar energy into remote areas. Earlier this year we decided to transition out of the NGO model into a social enterprise model, in order to improve sustainability as we saw the need to scale up. Our approach has two fundamental pillars: quality and service. We have slowly introduced Barefoot Power products in order to build the brand and trust in the products. By building a network of entrepreneurs to which we offer constant training and support we are pushing this emphasis of quality and service down to the end customer. This has quickly allowed us to differentiate ourselves from distributors of cheaper products with no after-sales service. \r\n\r\nYour contributions will help us bring much needed stock in order to meet the large demand and grow the business. This stock will then be given to local entrepreneurs we have trained to sell these products in very remote areas of the country, where they are most needed. This loan will help us in that final push to establish our business and the Barefoot Power products into a known and trusted brand. The largest challenge with solar energy in Cambodia is the lack of trust due to the availability of very cheap, low quality products, and no after-sales service support.

He is married and has two independent children. Boturjon is a farmer. He has been working in agriculture for 4 years and has gained much experience and a love for the land. He began cultivating his land through his own efforts and has gradually gotten ahead in life. He has been producing such crops as wheat, onion, potatoes. Each year he has produced a yield sufficient for the family consumption and for selling. \n\nFarming is the family's main source of income.  To generate a stable income, the business requires considerable funding. Boturjon is asking for a loan of $1000 USD. He would like to use this loan to buy supplies for the harvest and to improve production and thus increase the quality of his yield along with his earnings. Boturjon and his family are counting on your help. He thanks all who support him and promises to repay the loan in time.  \n\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\n\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition.

They attend meetings at the German Busch community center.  The group formed recently from the necessity of accessing a loan.  All of them need to increase their working capital.  They all have different businesses like making skirts, selling doll clothes, selling fruit, making filing cabinets, selling plastics, and selling food.\r\n\r\nJhenny Lizethe C. is one of the members of this group.  She is 20, and she was motivated to join the group by an invitation of a friend.  Jhenny has been making Barbie doll clothes for three years.  She took the initiative because her mother sells toys, and lots of her customers asked her for doll clothes.  So, she started to make them.  She will use the loan to buy fabric and lace.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva

He has 2 young children who attend school. He has owned a car repair shop and specializes in car body work. He has been involved in this occupation for more than 15 years. With his experience, he has been able to gain a good number of clients asking for his reparation services. He works hard, as he is the only family provider, to support the heavy expenses of his life and to pay for his children's schooling. He plans to make some modifications and expand his shop and to do so, he is asking to borrow $1000 from Kiva's partner Ameen s.a.l. to buy additional tools.\r\n\r\nNote: Based on the political and social challenges of Lebanon, personally identifiable attributes of this entrepreneur have been altered to protect him (i.e., blacking out portions of the entrepreneur in his picture, not indicating his name and location, etc.) Ameen s.a.l. appreciates Kiva lenders' understanding of these challenges and encourages lenders to continue their support for Lebanon's borrowers.\r\n\r\nAbout Ameen:\r\nAmeen s.a.l. has been a major player in the Lebanese microfinance sector since 1999. Originally, a micro-credit program created by CHF International, Ameen evolved to become Ameen s.a.l. in 2003, a Lebanese services company. In 2007, Ameen s.a.l. registered with the Central Bank of Lebanon to become the first Lebanese financial institution specialized in microfinance.\r\n\r\nAt Ameen s.a.l. we pledge to provide financial services to the largest number of micro and small entrepreneurs and to the working poor, to help them develop their businesses and improve their incomes.\r\n\r\nAmeen has been able to use its interest-free loans with Kiva to offer lower-interest loans with faster disbursement for their micro-loan borrowers. Since its inception, Ameen has provided high-quality financial services to over 41,000 borrowers and disbursed over 81,000 loans totaling $115 million.

His wife is his only dependent although she too helps out because, seeing how difficult the situation is, she tends to a store installed in the house.\n\nBecause of his age, Alejo can no longer look for work; he can\u2019t find employment anywhere.  He used to be a bricklayer and always worked his fields.   He still works in his fields during planting and harvesting but getting a job isn\u2019t a reality anymore.  Therefore, Alejo only raises animals to sell now. Currently he raises lambs and will use the loan to buy baby lambs and a few calves to raise.\n\nFor the moment, Alejo won\u2019t realize any profits.  On the contrary, he\u2019ll have to feed them for a time.  But what helps is that he has harvested and has pasturage to feed them.\n\nAlejo says that he hopes the animals he will buy will produce offspring in a few months so that his economic situation will improve greatly.  Alejo wants to use his profits to save up because at his age and with the economic situation that might develop he will be able to have money available for food and medicines he or his wife might need.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":662262,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":" To buy lambs and calves to raise and then sell.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"San Felipe del Progreso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2010-12-15T17:20:13Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":650,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alejo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-12-09T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":8000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":1164.32},{"due_date":"2011-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":1225},{"due_date":"2011-03-09T08:00:00Z","amount":1317.13},{"due_date":"2011-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":1357.48},{"due_date":"2011-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1433.16},{"due_date":"2011-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1502.91}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":94.6},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":99.53},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":107.02},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110.29},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.45},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":122.11}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":94.6,"local_amount":1164.32,"processed_date":"2011-01-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T03:44:11Z","rounded_local_amount":1174.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191430728},{"amount":99.53,"local_amount":1225,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:44:57Z","rounded_local_amount":1235.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195849993},{"amount":107.02,"local_amount":1317.13,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:10:18Z","rounded_local_amount":1328.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201292265},{"amount":110.29,"local_amount":1357.48,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:08:50Z","rounded_local_amount":1369.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206160548},{"amount":116.45,"local_amount":1432.67,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:22:47Z","rounded_local_amount":1445.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211233474},{"amount":122.11,"local_amount":1503.4,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:12:31Z","rounded_local_amount":1516.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216512365}],"funded_date":"2010-12-16T08:22:26Z","paid_date":"2011-07-15T11:12:31Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":262129,"name":"Keo's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Four people in Preaek Samraong village in Kandal province are forming this group loan.

Prior to the break-up of the Soviet Union, Bakitnur had worked as a veterinarian at a collective farm and then decided to start his own animal husbandry business after the break-up.  Starting with a sum of 20,000 som (KGS), Bakitnur was able to develop his business to yield a monthly income of about 28,000 som (KGS).  In order to further develop his business, he requested a loan in the sum of 80,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company to buy calves for fattening up.  He plans to use the income from this loan for repair his house and further increasing livestock headcount."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1775,"image":{"id":870639,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase cattle","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Tuyp village, Issyk-Kul region","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2011-09-13T17:40:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1775,"lender_count":64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Bakitnur","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-08-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":80000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":1775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2013-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":40000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":887.5},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":887.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":887.5,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T12:02:07Z","rounded_local_amount":40004.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331070894},{"amount":887.5,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T14:05:56Z","rounded_local_amount":40004.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339459362}],"funded_date":"2011-09-27T20:17:00Z","paid_date":"2013-02-15T14:05:56Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Anna Sorokina","image":null}},{"id":340008,"name":"Elvira","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Elvira is 51 years old and married.
