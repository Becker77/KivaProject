<i>pagnes<\/i> (colorful West African cloth) and embroidered cloth, over thirty years ago.\u00a0 She is much in demand, especially by her customer base (composed essentially of women), for the quality of her products.\u00a0 She receives many orders from the surrounding towns and her business is doing very nicely.\u00a0 \r\n\r\nConcerned about further satisfying her burgeoning customer base, Madougou decided to join the micro-finance institution Soro Yiriwaso about seven years ago.\u00a0 After several solidarity loans (group loans) in a women's association in her district, she is now on her tenth individual loan.\u00a0 All the previous ones were properly repaid.\u00a0 \r\n\r\nShe plans on using her loan to buy 24 bolts of wax <i>pagnes<\/i> cloth, 18 outfits of embroidered fabrics, and 10 pairs of plastic footwear.\u00a0 She gets her supplies in Bamako (capital of Mali) and then resells them door-to-door in Sikasso and often in the towns surrounding Sikasso.\u00a0 \r\n\r\nMadougou envisions using this loan to make a monthly profit of 180,000 francs CFA, which will be used essentially to increase her working capital, to help cover family expenses, and to pay the loan interest.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva

She lives in Brgy. Balisong, Argao, Cebu. \r\n\r\nShe has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2008 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her food vending, farming and sari-sari store businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. \r\n\r\nShe now earns an average monthly income of PHP 6000. Marcela is now borrowing PHP 20000 so that she can have additional capital. This will be her 6th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 10000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Marcela aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She will save the profits, because through this business she wants to make her dreams come true \u2013 to have her own house and to move back to Haiti.\r\n\r\nGraciela's association with Esperanza began because she wants to improve her business and learn more about how to run a business. Her story is representative of her group and of Esperanza's Haitian and Dominican clients generally, many of whom recently emigrated to the DR from Haiti. Her group is located in the rural area surrounding La Romana, where the sugarcane harvest and tourist industry dominate the economy. This area, like nearly all impoverished areas of the Dominican Republic, suffers from unreliable running water (none of which is potable) and irregular electricity.

Advantages are that it does not need a large start-up capital and there is always a high demand. While disadvantages are that most of these goods are perishable, therefore need fast sales. \r\n\r\nKanybek A., 34, is a member of this group. He is single and lives with only person who is financially dependent on him,  a seven-year-old nephew. Kanybek really wants his nephew to grow to be an independent, educated person and he does his best to provide him with all the necessities. Therefore, 4 years ago, Kanybek made his first steps into the business sphere. He used 75,000 soms of his savings to start the wholesale of consumer goods in a market of his home-town, Kerben. He plans to spend a loan from Kiva on investing in goods circulation. He expects to earn 7,000 soms per month, which will be used to make the payments for this loan, to pay health-care related expenses and to take a better care of his nephew. The remaining portion will be put back into his business. Kanybek has fought so that he and his nephew won\u2019t lack anything. He pledges to successfully repay the loan and dreams to open a chain of shops in future. \r\n\r\n      --- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance (MBF), a young, ambitious and socially-focused Microfinance Institution in Kyrgyzstan. \r\nMBF is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development and upholds the triple bottom line \u2013 People (building human capital and taking care of its customers as well as society), Planet (keeping environmentally friendly) and Profit (earning revenue to expand autonomously).

She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help Eliza continue the operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP10,000 loan. She will use the loan to buy more quantities and varieties of products to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nEliza dreams to be able to give her all her children a high-quality education through all her hard work on her business.

He is on his third individual loan and the two preceding ones were correctly repaid.  \r\n\r\nMonsieur Idrissa plans to put together a big stock by buying different pharmaceutical products (medicines) with this loan. He buys his goods from the important pharmacists in Bamako and often in Koutiala if it is not a big order. He sells daily in his pharmacy at the big open-air market of Koutiala to a clientele composed of women and men, for cash and very rarely on credit. \r\n\r\nHe expects to make a monthly profit of 225,000 F CFA which he expects to use to reimburse the loan as it comes due, investing the rest in his business.

She earns a minimum of 400 PHP in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue the operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 22,000 loan. She will be using the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nNoselyn hopes her business grows in the coming years and and dreams of being able to give her children a good and high-quality education through all her hard work on her business.

As an association, Centro Agricola helps the farmers by providing access to machinery and training services. The farmers from Centro Agricola have received special instruction on financial responsibility and accounting from Codemicro, an organization that specializes in training programs geared towards the rural sector.  \r\n<\/p> \r\n<p>The members of Centro Agricola de Baba will use the micro-loans to prepare their lands and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each others' guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the Centro Agricola de Baba Association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many micro-finance programs, but Mifex believes that is imperative for the communities we works with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties. <\/p> \r\n<p><em>Below is more information about Santa Lucia compiled by Luis Crespo and Robert Edgar of the Mifex team when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. <\/em><\/p> \r\n<h4>Economy of Baba<\/h4> \r\n<p>The people of Baba have been organized since the days of Gran Colombia when Ecuador was yet to be a country. The area has always been popular because of the extremely productive lands that gave way to cultivation of cacao for decades. Now Baba is a county in the province of Los Rios in the coastal region of Ecuador. For most of the latter part of the 20th Century it was a cacao and banana producing sector. Most of the surrounding areas of Baba in Los Rios are owned by large mulitnational  \r\ncompanies such as Dole, but Baba is a sector characterized by the small and informal farms. <\/p>\r\n<p>Rice production has now turned into the main economic activity of the sector as about 80% of the people are rice farmers. Cacao is still very popular in the area, but because of the long cultivation cycle people prefer to invest in rice. The lands in Baba are very fertile though, and most farmers in the sector often grow other crops, such as plantains and soy beans  \r\nas secondary sources of income.  Many farmers also keep livestock as emergency sources of food and income, commonly resorting to selling a chicken or pig if they are in need of cash. <\/p> \r\n<h4>Rice Farming in Santa Lucia<\/h4> \r\n<p>Most of the people in the Baba area are small farmers. They produce about 80 sacks of rice per hectare of land. In order to farm they first must prepare the lands by removing weeds, plowing and leveling the lands. This is the most difficult part for the farmers in Baba, who often lack the necessary machinery to properly plow the lands for rice production. After appropriately preparing the lands, the farmers fill an area with water to form what is known as a paddy field, because rice is a very water intensive crop. The rice seeds are either dispersed freely (the process is known as boleo in Spanish) or hand sowed. Once the rice has grown, most farmers rent machinery that helps them gather their production. <\/p> \r\n<h4>Access to Credit<\/h4> \r\n<p>One of the biggest struggles in the area has been the lack of credit due to the absence of any type of financial institution. \r\nBecause people do not count on formal financial finance, they have turned to loan sharks for financing. They have been affected by expensive lines of credit that exceed 100% interest a year and can be as expensive as 240%. Intermediaries also exploit the farmers because of their outstanding debt. Farmers also lack skills and knowledge to commercialize their products and pay fair prices for their crops. <\/p> \r\n<h4>Risks<\/h4> \r\n<p>The largest risk in the sector is due to absence of watering systems. Although Baba is in the province \u201cLos Rios\u201d (the rivers) there is severe problem with access to water. The lack of infrastructure in the sector does not allow the small farmers to benefit from the presence of the many rivers in the area. If the winter season is too dry, it is likely that the lands will not be sufficiently fertile for rice production in the summer. On the other hand, if there is too much rain there are not any drainage systems to prevent flooding and the crops are often ruined. Generally speaking though, Baba is a very productive sector where the lands yield all types of crops including rice, cacao, corn, watermelons, plantains, and soy beans. <\/p> \r\n<h4>Loan Use<\/h4> \r\n<p>The loans in this sector will mostly be used to to buy soil, seeds, fertilizer and insecticides. Many clients will use the capital towards renting machinery and equipment necessary to effectively work and prepare the fields. Clients also typically use a part of the loan to buy livestock in order to raise and have as reserves. The loan repayment schedule is different from the typical micro-entrepreneur because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures. Mifex asks our rural clients only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 6 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the seventh and final month. <\/p>\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":25840,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Rice farming","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Baba","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-1.783333 -79.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":7,"posted_date":"2007-04-12T06:16:29Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":675,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Flavio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-04-26T21:25:35Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":675,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2007-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2007-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2007-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2007-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2007-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2007-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2007-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":112.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":113,"local_amount":113,"processed_date":"2007-06-08T09:15:34Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T22:10:47Z","rounded_local_amount":113,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":21414},{"amount":54,"local_amount":54,"processed_date":"2007-07-13T22:29:09Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T22:10:47Z","rounded_local_amount":54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":31800},{"amount":54,"local_amount":54,"processed_date":"2007-09-07T19:10:10Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T22:10:47Z","rounded_local_amount":54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":51879},{"amount":513,"local_amount":513,"processed_date":"2008-01-03T21:51:32Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T22:10:47Z","rounded_local_amount":513,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":107758}],"funded_date":"2007-04-12T21:25:35Z","paid_date":"2008-01-03T21:51:32Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":12160,"name":"Mahammad","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mahammad H. is a farmer in Bilasuvar city.

in a sympathetic group like this but they guarantee that they are responsible people with great human qualities and as such the Fundacion Agrocapital offers them the opportunity to increase their revenue and better their families\u2019 quality of life.<p>\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ines Teles, Kiva

Rosario is thankful because they still can manage to eat three times a day. \r\n\r\nShe hopes that she can have the PHP 10,000 loan she is requesting. She will use the loan for her poultry business. This is an important business for her family because it helps pay for a large portion of her children\u2019s education. She has been in business for two years and feels that she is ready to expand her business and increase her income. Especially now that two of her children are studying in college, their school costs are getting higher and an increase in income would be very helpful.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

By working hard at her businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of $210. \r\n\r\nEvelyn is now borrowing 15,000 PHP so that she can continue purchasing items like vitamins and other supplies to sell. This will be her 4th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of 9,000 PHP, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Evelyn hopes to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

This is 35-year-old Debora Leonard. She is married and has three children ages two, seven, and thirteen. In 2005, Debora established her small grocery shack (or genge) business. Working six days a week, and  nine to twelve hours a day, she earns about 30 USD every month from this business. Debora requires a loan in order to purchase more sugar, salt, cooking oil and home appliances in bulk. In the future, Debora plans to expand her business. She thanks you for your support.  \r\n<P>\r\nThe Swahili word for this type of outside shop, or stall, is \"genge.\" A genge is usually a very basic structure made of wood, with a tin roof, which sells general items such as onions, tomatoes, chiles, oil, rice, and dried fish. It is the kind of place local people usually send their children running to fetch something when they are in the middle of cooking the evening meal and discover they are short an ingredient or two.\r\n<P>\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of microcredit in Tanzania. The organization is devoted to the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through microfinance as a practical way to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women. Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets; because of this, they are deemed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support, hence poor access to basic needs and services. When a client needs working capital to buy a specific item, SELFINA buys the equipment for said client and extends a loan to her. The same equipment is then leased back to the client so they can use it while in process of paying back their loan, a process called a sale-and-leaseback arrangement. Once the loan has been repaid, SELFINA transfers the ownership of the equipment to the client. The advantage of microleasing over traditional microfinance loans is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":192573,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To purchase more sugar, salt, cooking oil and home appliances in bulk","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbeya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.9 33.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-08-30T19:10:31Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":450,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Debora S.","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-09-13T20:13:27Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2008-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2008-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":90},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":90},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":90},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":90},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":90}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":90,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2008-10-11T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-21T07:17:51Z","rounded_local_amount":104220,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356204},{"amount":90,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2008-11-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T04:18:40Z","rounded_local_amount":104220,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5347946},{"amount":90,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2008-12-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:09:05Z","rounded_local_amount":104220,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9970520},{"amount":90,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-01-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:13:32Z","rounded_local_amount":104220,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14886737},{"amount":90,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-02-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:02:33Z","rounded_local_amount":104220,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20435997}],"funded_date":"2008-08-30T20:13:27Z","paid_date":"2009-03-16T21:02:33Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":65436,"name":"Ni Wayan Subeg","description":{"languages":["id","en"],"texts":{"id":"Tinggal di pedesaan tentunya hanya bertani saja yang bisa ditekuni Wayan Subeg bersama suaminya.

Pinjaman pertama yang diperoleh Wayan digunakan untuk membeli 1 ekor induk babi serta pakannya. Pemeliharaan yang dilakukan sangat sederhana dengan kandang yang seadanya saja. Setelah 5 bulan dipelihara, induk babi tersebut menghasilkan 8 ekor anak babi yang kemudian dijual menghasilkan keuntungan bersih sebesar Rp. 1000.000,-. Dari hasil ini Wayan melanjutkan ke pinjaman kedua dengan besar Rp. 1.500.000,- dalam jangka waktu 6 bulan pengembalian yang kemudian dibelikannya 1 ekor induk babi lagi serta pakan yang lebih bermutu dari sebelumnya.

She is a 38-year-old married mother with two dependent children. <p>\r\nShe is a competent woman who offers photocopy services in her business, which she runs from home. She serves a sizeable amount of customers, which is why she feels happy to be the only copy center in the neighborhood across the street from a school. <p>\r\nShe also states that in order to get settled, she had to overcome many challenges. She started out with just a multifunction printer, but upon seeing that it was too slow, she decided to purchase a bigger copy machine so that she could offer her customers speedy services. <p>\r\nShe is now well-known by her customers, who are mostly students, friends, neighbors, and steady customers. She also has supportive personnel. <p>\r\nShe would like to invest this 1,000.00 PEN loan in purchasing reams of bond paper and toner cartridges so that she can have the necessary supplies and not run out when she most needs them. <p>\r\nGabic now feels like a capable woman with a stronger desire to get ahead in life and realize her dreams.

The family has access to electricity and piped water and gets three meals a day. Norah incurs transportation costs to and from buying secondhand clothes from Owino market. She works in a semi-urban area on the outskirts of Kampala. \r\n\r\nShe owns a shop in Ntinda Bukoto 11 Parish where she sells all types of secondhand clothes. She sells both retail and wholesale. Norah works seven days a week, receiving an average of thirty customers a day. Her major business challenges include the ever-increasing cost of secondhand clothes. Her monthly expenses include feeding the family and medication.  \r\n\r\nNorah has been in this business for over eighteen years and with MCDT for ten years, now servicing her twenty-first loan and working with the same group mates. Norah joined MCDT because it was near her home and also because she likes working in groups. She wants to use this loan to buy more secondhand clothes to sell.

He lives with his partner, 25 year-old Haydee.  Together they have 2 children: 6 year-old Jefferson and 1 year-old Renzo.  They live in their own home which is located in the town of Ricrican.  This hard-working man is a farmer.  His main crops are tubers such as potatoes and 'olluco' (a native tuber).  \"My parents taught me everything I needed to know about cultivation techniques\", he says.\r\n\r\nThe good care that Alberto constantly takes of his crops means that his harvests are good and are in great demand in Tarma's central market.  He has been doing this hard work for 10 years.  Now Alberto not only continues growing crops but he also bought several rams which are now growing strong and healthy.  Alberto is certain of the willpower and strength that he has and so he is investing some more in improving his crops.\r\n\r\nThis is Alberto's ninth loan with MFP and he is a responsible and very hard-working member of his community bank.  He will use his loan money to buy 10 sacks of organic fertilizer which costs around 100 Peruvian soles a sack and, if the loan money stretches far enough, he will also invest in maintaining his farmland.  For this, he needs laborers who he will hire to help clear the weeds that are growing on his land."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":667421,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

They have five school aged children.  They live together in the city of Santa Rosa, where they have their own home built from rustic materials. When she saw the grocery stores that her friend and neighbors had, she saw what she wanted. She was a teenager then, and her studies were truncated because her parents didn't help her cover her education costs. That's how Ruth started to work as a day laborer in different fields for some time. With the money she was able to save up she was able to make her dream of opening a store come true. At present, she is happy and at peace seeing that her dreams are taking shape. In addition, her earnings are going very well, and this because she has a variety of products to offer her customers. Normally, she works on her own, but occasionally she has her children's help. Her point of sale is in the market of her own community. She hopes to improve more every day and for that she needs your help so she can supply her store and be able to compete with the other merchants and keep her customers. This is her sixth loan with MFP, and she is committed to continuing making her payments on time. She is also happy with her community bank, since all of them make their payments.

V. is one of the leaders in the rural community of Baba. He has lived in Baba his entire life and he is not only dedicated to making his farm successful, but also to helping those around him. He is a centerpiece in the Centro Agricola de Baba, which is the association that is forming the Communal Bank in the sector. As a borrower, Jacinto will invest his loan in rice farming, like most of the others in the communal bank. He will use the money to buy seeds, fertilizer, pesticides and also to rent machinery. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Communal Banking in Baba<\/h4> \r\n\r\n<p>This borrower is part of the newest and largest Communal Bank in the recently developed Mifex Rural Finance Program. All of the members of the Centro Agricola de Baba Communal Bank are part of an Association of Rice Farmers in the county of Baba in rural Ecuador. Their association works cooperatively to cultivate rice and commercialize the product after it has grown. As an association, Centro Agricola helps the farmers by providing access to machinery and training services. The farmers from Centro Agricola have received special instruction on financial responsibility and accounting from Codemicro, an organization that specializes in training programs geared towards the rural sector.  \r\n\r\n<\/p> \r\n\r\n<p>The members of Centro Agricola de Baba will use the micro-loans to prepare their lands and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each others' guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the Centro Agricola de Baba Association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many micro-finance programs, but Mifex believes that is imperative for the communities we works with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties. <\/p> \r\n\r\n<p><em>Below is more information about Santa Lucia compiled by Luis Crespo and Robert Edgar of the Mifex team when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. <\/em><\/p> \r\n\r\n<h4>Economy of Baba<\/h4> \r\n\r\n<p>The people of Baba have been organized since the days of Gran Colombia when Ecuador was yet to be a country. The area has always been popular because of the extremely productive lands that gave way to cultivation of cacao for decades. Now Baba is a county in the province of Los Rios in the coastal region of Ecuador. For most of the latter part of the 20th Century it was a cacao and banana-producing sector. Most of the surrounding areas of Baba in Los Rios are owned by large multinational companies such as Dole, but Baba is a sector characterized by small and informal farms. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rice production has now turned into the main economic activity of the sector as about 80% of the people are rice farmers. Cacao is still very popular in the area, but because of the long cultivation cycle people prefer to invest in rice. The lands in Baba are very fertile though, and most farmers in the sector often grow other crops, such as plantains and soybeans as secondary sources of income.  Many farmers also keep livestock as emergency sources of food and income, commonly resorting to selling a chicken or pig if they are in need of cash. <\/p> \r\n\r\n<h4>Rice Farming<\/h4> \r\n\r\n<p>Most of the people in the Baba area are small farmers. They produce about 80 sacks of rice per hectare of land. In order to farm they first must prepare the lands by removing weeds, plowing and leveling the lands. This is the most difficult part for the farmers in Baba, who often lack the necessary machinery to properly plow the lands for rice production. After appropriately preparing the lands, the farmers fill an area with water to form what is known as a paddy field, because rice is a very water-intensive crop. The rice seeds are either dispersed freely (the process is known as boleo in Spanish) or hand sowed. Once the rice has grown, most farmers rent machinery that helps them gather their production. <\/p> \r\n\r\n<h4>Access to Credit<\/h4> \r\n\r\n<p>One of the biggest struggles in the area has been the lack of credit due to the absence of any type of financial institution. \r\n\r\nBecause people do not count on formal financial finance, they have turned to loan sharks for financing. They have been affected by expensive lines of credit that exceed 100% interest a year and can be as expensive as 240%. Intermediaries also exploit the farmers because of their outstanding debt. Farmers also lack skills and knowledge to commercialize their products and pay fair prices for their crops. <\/p> \r\n\r\n<h4>Risks<\/h4> \r\n\r\n<p>The largest risk in the sector is due to absence of watering systems. Although Baba is in the province \u201cLos Rios\u201d (the rivers) there is severe problem with access to water. The lack of infrastructure in the sector does not allow the small farmers to benefit from the presence of the many rivers in the area. If the winter season is too dry, it is likely that the lands will not be sufficiently fertile for rice production in the summer. On the other hand, if there is too much rain, there are not any drainage systems to prevent flooding and the crops are often ruined. Generally speaking though, Baba is a very productive sector where the lands yield all types of crops including rice, cacao, corn, watermelons, plantains, and soybeans. <\/p> \r\n\r\n<h4>Loan Use<\/h4> \r\n\r\n<p>The loans in this sector will mostly be used to buy soil, seeds, fertilizer and insecticides. Many clients will use the capital towards renting machinery and equipment necessary to effectively work and prepare the fields. Clients also typically use a part of the loan to buy livestock in order to raise and have as reserves. The loan repayment schedule is different from the typical micro-entrepreneur because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures. Mifex asks our rural clients only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 6 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the seventh and final month. <\/p>\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":25910,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Rice Farming","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Baba","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-1.783333 -79.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":7,"posted_date":"2007-04-13T06:00:01Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1200,"lender_count":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jacinto","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-04-30T09:16:32Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1200,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":200}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":200}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":200,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2007-06-08T09:15:51Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T22:23:37Z","rounded_local_amount":200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":21438},{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-07-13T22:39:07Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T22:23:37Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":31815},{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-09-07T19:32:27Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T22:23:37Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":51901},{"amount":912,"local_amount":912,"processed_date":"2008-01-03T22:19:24Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T22:23:37Z","rounded_local_amount":912,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":107782}],"funded_date":"2007-04-16T09:16:32Z","paid_date":"2008-01-03T22:19:24Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":12192,"name":"Abdugaffur","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Abdugafuris is married and has 4 children.

Uganda is a country with a \u201cmissing generation\u201d of people between the ages of 35-55.

The other portion of his profits will be reinvested in his business. \n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1175,"image":{"id":514164,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"To buy more clothes especially jeans for sale ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"RW","country":"Rwanda","town":"Kigali","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-1.953611 30.060556","type":"point"}},"partner_id":117,"posted_date":"2010-04-30T09:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1175,"lender_count":39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Eugene ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"RWF","disbursal_amount":680000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":1175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":68000},{"due_date":"2010-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":68000},{"due_date":"2010-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":68000},{"due_date":"2010-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":68000},{"due_date":"2010-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":68000},{"due_date":"2010-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":68000},{"due_date":"2010-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":68000},{"due_date":"2010-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":68000},{"due_date":"2010-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":68000},{"due_date":"2011-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":68000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":117.5},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":117.5},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":117.5},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":117.5},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":117.5},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":117.5},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":117.5},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":117.5},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":117.5},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":117.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":235,"local_amount":136000,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-17T08:11:05Z","rounded_local_amount":136753.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":145022906},{"amount":235,"local_amount":136000,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T12:17:12Z","rounded_local_amount":136753.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159709852},{"amount":117.5,"local_amount":68000,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-16T09:27:46Z","rounded_local_amount":68376.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":167037209},{"amount":117.5,"local_amount":68000,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-16T09:45:11Z","rounded_local_amount":68376.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172308917},{"amount":117.5,"local_amount":68000,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-16T11:53:21Z","rounded_local_amount":68376.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177616515},{"amount":117.5,"local_amount":68000,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:50:29Z","rounded_local_amount":68376.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182622724},{"amount":117.5,"local_amount":68000,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T14:55:27Z","rounded_local_amount":68376.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188760573},{"amount":117.5,"local_amount":68000,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T05:58:05Z","rounded_local_amount":68376.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191497564}],"funded_date":"2010-05-20T21:10:29Z","paid_date":"2011-02-16T05:58:05Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":193315,"name":"Arnolio","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Arnolio C. is from the village of Olango.

He was unsatisfied being unable to take charge of his own work while not being compensated for his value. This inspired him to take charge and start his own commercial cleaning business.  \r\n\r\nDue to the tough economic environment, it was difficult finding the capital needed to purchase the equipment necessary to run his small business.  Luckily, the little help he has received from his family was enough to jump start his business.  Proof that he is business savvy, he has been able to find work during the economic recession and has been able to keep his clients very satisfied.  \r\n\r\nBeing approved for the ACCION USA loan will facilitate his business growth by purchasing more equipment and cleaners, allowing him to expand services to his current and future clients.\r\n\r\nAbout U.S. Microfinance and ACCION USA\r\n\r\nHave you ever thought about how the new caf\u00e9 on your corner and the delivery service that brings the fresh baked goods acquired the financial resources to start their business? Chances are, they drummed up support from their friends and family, dipped into their personal savings, used a high-interest credit card, or all of the above. An estimated 10 million small businesses in the U.S. face difficulty obtaining loans from traditional banks, even prior to the current \u201ccredit crisis.\u201d Microfinance institutions, like ACCION USA, support these \u201cunbanked\u201d small businesses by giving them access to fairly-priced capital and business education. \r\n\r\nSmall businesses also help stabilize low- to moderate-income neighborhoods and rebuild our economy through income growth and job creation. Self-employment provides workers with a way to increase their incomes, support their families, and strengthen their communities. As unemployment rises in the U.S., more and more people are turning to self-employment and start-up enterprises as a way to take control of their economic futures and provide employment opportunities in their communities. The need for support of small businesses in the U.S. is great, and it is one that ACCION USA has been striving to meet since

Komil is married and the father of three children. He is a farmer and since his marriage he has demonstrated that he can support his family with hard work and dedication. Because of this, he is always in the fields, growing wheat and vegetables. Komil leaves early in the morning to water the fields, then fertilizes and fumigates the crops. This work is satisfying, and it enables him to purchase goods for his home. \r\n\r\nKomil would like to request a loan of 8500 Somoni which he will use to buy necessary farm materials like seeds and fertilizers since they are very expensive. He is very optimistic that this loan will improve his yield and he hopes to have a continuous partnership with the lenders. Komil always makes sure that he respects the people around him since he believes that respect begets respect.    \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

El Sr. Paulino solicita el apoyo para compra de herrer\u00eda y colocar un port\u00f3n met\u00e1lico al frente de su domicilio; este port\u00f3n le dar\u00e1 una bonita fachada a su casa pero lo mas importante ofrecer\u00e1 seguridad a su familia cuando el no se encuentre en casa.","en":"Sr. Paulino is married and is 48 years old. He lives with his wife and two children in a social interest house that he acquired two years ago and that he still pays for at a discounted rate. When Paulino began to pay for his house he always did so thinking that it was also the property of his wife and children, and that if one day something were to happen to him they would not be left homeless. Since then, he has made continual improvements to his home such as putting up flooring, window protection, painting the interior and exterior, putting up fences, and other visible improvements. Sr. Paulino is asking for help to purchase ironworks and put a metal door on the front of his home. It will give a nice outward appearance to the home but the most important is that it will offer security to his family when he is not at home.

Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets; thus, they are termed not-creditworthy by financial institutions as they lack tangible collateral assets.  This leads to poor financial support, which is turn leads to poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.\r\n\r\nSELFINA buys from and leases equipment to women.  Where a client needs working capital, SELFINA buys equipment from the said client extending a loan to her, and then leases back the same equipment \u2013 a process called a \"sale and leaseback

He is a 27-year-old married man and has a 6-year-old daughter who is in the 2nd grade. \r\nWiliamo has passed through some difficult times. When he was a child his older sister invited him to live with her in Swaziland. Upon his arrival he began his studies. While attending the 3rd grade his father sent for him, claiming his son could not live so far from his twin brother. When in Namaacha, he managed to enroll in school and later completed the 10th grade. Due to his hard work in school he is solicited for a job at the local community radio station located in the secondary school building as a radio announcer during the hours of 6-8 where he made 1500.00mt monthly. Years later he became involved with a local honey production venture financed by the Namaacha district government. The funding was valued at 125000.00mt for a group of 6 people who were reimbursed every 3 months at 12000.00mt during a period of 11 months. However he was not able to meet these expectations due to poor weather conditions. For this reason he solicits a loan worth 15000.00mt from Hluvuku in order to begin his own business acquiring honey from Inhambane and reselling it in Namaacha. Each trip he purchases 80 liters of honey and resells each liter at 120, obtaining a monthly profit of 6000.00mt. \r\nAlong with his daughter, Wiliamo is responsible for the care of his mother with whom he resides. \r\nThis is Wiliamo's third loan with Hluvuku and his first with Kiva. The first two were used to purchases products for resale. The current loan will be used to start a new business selling honey in local communities. He is very confident that he will pay back his loan before the deadline and that he will ask for a new loan to strengthen his business. \r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by

Bineba is the mother of four children. She lives in Ntamulung, Cameroon.  \r\n\r\nShe has been with GHAPE since 2004 and has demonstrated a credit-worthy character exemplified by her repayments, consistent attendance at meetings, and support of her borrowing group. \r\n\r\nR. never had the opportunity to go to school because her parents could not afford her fees and needs, so she resorted to becoming a farmer in her youth. Sadly, her father finally died in 1990 and monkeys ate all her crops last year. She was financially down, but with the management skills she acquired from GHAPE, she was able to repay her loan. \r\n\r\nWith this latest loan, R. is hoping to continue the business supported by her prior loans and add a motorbike business. She has requested a loan to purchase a motorbike and a few seedlings. The seedlings will eventually be farmed during the rainy season. R. is confident that her business will succeed, because her business has been successful for a long time.\r\n  \r\nShe hopes to use the profits from her business to provide for the various needs of her family. As the sole provider for her family of four, R. hopes to increase her profits so she has enough to pay for her children\u2019s school fees and provide for her family\u2019s nourishment.  \r\n\r\n\r\nAbout GHAPE:\r\n\r\nR.'s loan will be provided by Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE), a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon.  GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach. Every client is trained in business management, basic health, life skills, financial management, profits and losses, and family values. Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement.

She also goes to graze her sheep in the countryside while she waits for the planted products to mature so she can harvest them and take them to the suppliers' market in the nearest city so they can be sold.

Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is a single mother and has one seven-year-old son. Mrs. Ana used to devote herself to selling fruit-flavored lollipops to cover the economic needs of her household. Later she decided to get involved in selling groceries, but she didn\u2019t have enough money to expand her business before she joined the \u201cCiudad de los Tres Pisos\u201d communal bank. With her first loan for S.\/300.00, she was able to buy a wider variety of products to stock her grocery store. Later, with her earnings and other loans she received from her communal bank, she bought rice, sugar, milk, noodles, vegetables, crackers, etc, and now she owns a variety store in her own home. With this loan of $525 which she will pay in 6 months, she will buy dozens of different brands and flavors of soft drinks, rice, 50 kg bags of sugar, packets of noodles, oil, boxes of soap, stews of different flavors, and so on, to offer to her demanding clientele.

This is 32-year-old Kristina  M.. She is married and has three children aged six, nine and 12. In 2001, Kristina established her crops-selling business. Kristina requires a loan in order to buy more crops in bulk. She thanks you for your support.\r\n\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of microcredit in Tanzania. The organization is devoted to the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through microfinance as a practical way to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women. Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets; because of this, they are deemed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support, hence poor access to basic needs and services. When a client needs working capital to buy a specific item, SELFINA buys the equipment for said client and extends a loan to her. The same equipment is then leased back to the client so they can use it while in process of paying back their loan, a process called a sale-and-leaseback arrangement. Once the loan has been repaid, SELFINA transfers the ownership of the equipment to the client. The advantage of microleasing over traditional microfinance loans is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":192627,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To buy crops in bulk","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbeya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.9 33.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-08-30T18:30:48Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":450,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kristina P.","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-09-13T19:56:46Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2008-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2008-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":90},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":90},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":90},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":90},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":90}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":90,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2008-10-11T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-21T07:17:56Z","rounded_local_amount":104220,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356217},{"amount":90,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2008-11-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T04:18:51Z","rounded_local_amount":104220,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5347970},{"amount":90,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2008-12-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:09:22Z","rounded_local_amount":104220,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9970544},{"amount":90,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-01-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:13:32Z","rounded_local_amount":104220,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14886761},{"amount":90,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-02-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:02:34Z","rounded_local_amount":104220,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20436021}],"funded_date":"2008-08-30T19:56:46Z","paid_date":"2009-03-16T21:02:34Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":65484,"name":"Nguyen Thi","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Nguyen Thi L. joined TYM in 2005.

","en":"Manzura S. is a 37-year-old divorced mother of two children.  She lives in the town of Kostakoz, and works as a nursing assistant in a medical clinic.

She is 32 years old. Analyn is married and has 2 infant-aged children. To make a living, Analyn owns and operates a fishing business. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from harvesting and selling ocean-caught fish in the local community. Analyn has been engaged in her business for over 10 years and earns approximately 5,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2005, Analyn joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Analyn successfully repaid a previous loan of 20,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to to purchase fishing equipment, including hooks and nets. Analyn is requesting a new loan of 30000 PHP, which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This loan will be the eighth loan taken out by Analyn from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n<p>\r\nAbout PMPC\r\n<p>\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao.

Knowing that a winner never quits, Ma Theresa A., moves on from her past with conviction that she will finish whatever she has started, and finish it well. At 46, Theresa is married to Emilio, an employee, and together they raise a child who is now in high school. Theresa did not finish college, but she makes sure that unfinished tasks will never happen again in her life, or the life of her child.\r\n\r\nTheresa presently runs a sari-sari (variety) store out of her residence. Being in the business for ten years now, Theresa has been doing well in her business and is earning around 9,000 PHP per month. Bible studies and trainings at CCT* also give her enough encouragement to keep growing and dreaming for greater things in her business and family.\r\n\r\nPart of any business is staying profitable, healthy and growing. So to help her grow her business, Theresa has requested a loan for 20,000 PHP. She will use this money to add more items to her store and attract more customers. She also wants to renovate her store and plans to use part of the loan money to start the renovation. She believes that more products on her shelves and a better-looking store would help increase her monthly income.\r\n\r\nAt present, Theresa admits finding it hard to be in competition with many other sari-sari stores in her area. Also, there are customers who are hard to follow up with in terms of their debts. Theresa also thinks of her child\u2019s high school expenses. However, despite these financial problems, Theresa is certain that she will end up finishing the race of life and emerging the winner. She dreams of seeing her business expand and eventually have branches in many locations. She also desires to help her mother out and of course, to see her child finish college with flying colors.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay micro finance loans.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":657304,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General
