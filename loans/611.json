is married and lives in Zaporozhye in south central Ukraine. He used to work in a factory. However, after the times of perestroika and the collapse of the Soviet Union, he resigned and started working as a market vendor. Unfortunately, he was unable to make enough at that time to meet his family\u2019s basic needs so he decided to try working in construction. After working there for some time his health began to deteriorate and he was forced to quit. In the meantime, his wife had begun working at the market trying to make ends meet and so Yuryi decided to join her. He was able to get enough money together to purchase a supply of batteries, bulbs, dishware, and other small items to start a small vending kiosk. Today, Yuryi has a successful business selling household items in one of the local markets. \r\n\r\nPrevious loans have secured the sustainability of Yuryi\u2019s business by promoting his sales and allowing him to purchase a new vending stall.

Preak Ta Thok village in Kandal province. The members plan to use the loan that they obtain for different purposes. The members selected Mr. Reaksmi K. as the village bank president.  He is a hard-working man because he breeds pigs and uses rice to make wine to sell. Since his breeding pigs business is doing well, he wants to expand it by purchasing more piglets to add to his business. His wife, Mrs. Phal Malay, is employed in a garment factory. Mr. Reaksmi K. is 27 years old and the father of a child who is enrolled in the local school. Mrs. Sokthet H. did not come to take a loan but her husband did, so he is shown in the picture instead.  \r\n\r\nSeven members in this group have end-of-term loans and the rest have monthly payment loans. They are not required to pay any principal on the loan until the very end of the loan term. End-of-term (EoT) loans are AMK\u2019s main product because it is the most beneficial to Cambodia\u2019s poor. It allows them to repay portions of the principal whenever they are financially able to. Most clients start to make payments many months before the end of the loan term. Almost all of AMK\u2019s clients make their payments on time. AMK has a delinquency rate of only 0.09% and AMK has a default rate of 0% on Kiva.

This is 36-year-old Tulafileka F. C. from Tukuyu. She is married with four children between the ages of 1 and 13. Additionally, she is responsible for supporting one dependent, an orphan whose parents died of HIV. \n\nTulafileka has been running a grocery business since 2007. A genge (grocery store) is usually a very basic structure made of wood, with a tin roof, which sells general items such as onions, tomatoes, chilli, oil, rice, and dried fish. It is the kind of place local people send their children running to fetch something when they are in the middle of cooking the evening meal and don\u2019t have time to go all the way to the market to buy the missing ingredient. \n\nTulafileka works at her business for 12 hours per day, 6 days per week. Tulafileka currently earns about 95USD a month from her business. She is requesting a loan of 625USD in order to purchase more sugar, beans, salt, cooking oil, rice, and wheat flour in bulk. In the future, she plans to increase the quantity and the range of her business. Tulafileka thanks you for your support!\n\nAbout SELFINA\n\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through micro-leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, and therefore they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro-leasing is that is allows clients to use their equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\n\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":303767,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To purchase more sugar, beans, salt, cooking oil rice, and wheat flour in bulk","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbeya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.9 33.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-04-17T17:00:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":625,"lender_count":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Tulafileka F.

For this reason, Farrukh gives thanks to IMON and Kiva for the support they are giving him with this loan, which will be of great benefit to his crops. \r\n\r\n\r\n<b>More about Tajikistan and IMON International<\/b>\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He and his wife have six children, ages 19, 17, 15, 13, 10, and 8. Vitaliano's father died when he was young, so he began helping his mother on their farm. As a result, he never finished primary school and hardly knows how to read or write. Like many dairy cow farmers in the area, he learned farming by helping his parents when he was a child. Vitaliano is a dairy cow farmer who produces and sells milk but, at the moment, they have only three dairy cows. Vitaliano and his family live in a small and humble home in Quillacollo, a large suburb of the city of Cochabamba. \r\n\r\nWith this loan from CIDRE, Vitaliano will purchase another dairy cow to augment his milk production. He hopes to increase his earnings and improve his family's quality of life. Vitaliano would like to construct a new home for his family and hopes that his five younger children will be able to study to become professionals. His oldest daughter could not continue her studies because Vitaliano and his wife lacked the financing necessary to pay for her education at the time, so she only studied through primary school and is currently working in Argentina."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":423259,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To

The main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling a variety of different products in the local community. Yolanda has been engaged in her business for over 14 years and earns approximately 3,500 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Yolanda joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Yolanda is requesting a loan of 5000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Yolanda from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand the borrower's business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Her previous loan of PHP 20,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 12,000, thus raising the family's standard of living. This time, for her fourteenth cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 23,000, which she intends to use to purchase more stocks to sell so that she can continue to save up for the future education of her children and meet her family needs. \r\n\r\nGina E. is truly a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon. Dungganon is a Hiligaynon word that means \"honorable.\" Through this alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities they could not even have dreamed of.

is Cheryl A., 40, resident of Pasay City, Philippines. She is married to Leonardo, a pedicab driver, and together they have a child who helps her with the business. By the grace of God, Cheryl has managed to support her child's schooling. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nCheryl operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go for to buy one sachet of shampoo, a Php5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns income by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling at piecemeal rates. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of Php200 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php10,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy more quantities of products like groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n \r\nCheryl dreams of being able to finish college education of her children with all of her work with the business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay Micro Finance loans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":644281,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To buy more quantities of products like groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Silang, Cavite","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2010-11-19T19:10:14Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":250,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Cheryl ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-11-09T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":666.62}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":50,"local_amount":2000.01,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-16T11:02:27Z","rounded_local_amount":2185.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182816881},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":2666.68,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T12:42:52Z","rounded_local_amount":2914.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188652824},{"amount":66.66,"local_amount":2666.68,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T02:29:03Z","rounded_local_amount":2914.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191395979},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":2666.63,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:29:19Z","rounded_local_amount":2913.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195814087}],"funded_date":"2010-11-19T22:52:07Z","paid_date":"2011-03-15T11:29:19Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Brett & Margaret Silberg","image":null}},{"id":254128,"name":"Hellen","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Hellen N. lives in the Busega neighborhood of Kampala, Uganda.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is married and has three sons. Her husband has a store for selling generators where there is high demand for generators. This is the only source of income for the family. Lubna wants to help her husband in the purchase of more generators for sale but she does not have enough money so she needs to take a loan from FATEN. When Lubna gets the loan, which is repaid on a monthly basis, she will be able to help her husband to sell more, increase his income and provide his family with better living conditions. Lubna is a conservative woman so her husband is photographed instead next to his store.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout this loan product:\r\n FATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

Each of the farmers is asking for an average loan of 5,349 Kenya shillings. Each of them will use his or her loan to purchase a One Acre Fund package, sufficient to cultivate one-quarter acre of maize and one-quarter acre of sorghum or millet.\n\nAs the representative of this Kiva group comprised of farmer-leaders, Rosemary is pictured on the right of the group with her hand raised.  Rosemary is a reliable member of the community.  She is married and has two children.  She is 56 years old, and she has been working as a farmer for the past 21 years to support her family.  In addition to this, Rosemary is very active in her community, including involvement in the women's group and savings group.

She has continued working with One Acre Fund, in order to get the best seed prices, to learn new farming methods, and to get fertilizer and hybrid seeds.  She described her harvest last year as \"Good.\"  She hopes to continue working with One Acre Fund and to continue enjoying the success she has been having with the One Acre Fund farm packages. \n\nAs an active member in her community, Rosemary also chose to be a group leader and Kiva representative, because she wants to help more farmers.  Rosemary plans on using future profits from the harvest to send children to school and to save for the future.  She has improved her life by working with One Acre Fund, because she has more farm training and she is able to feed the family. \n\nRosemary and her group need a loan to cover the initial costs of purchasing seeds and fertilizer through One Acre Fund.  One Acre Fund will repay the Kiva loan on behalf of the farmers, with the profits from the farmers\u2019 harvests.  One Acre Fund pre-purchases the seeds and fertilizer when prices are low and passes the cost savings along to the farmers.  Throughout the planting and harvesting season, One Acre Fund also provides training and support to the farmers as they make payments back to One Acre Fund.  With support from One Acre Fund and your loan, these farmers will have a chance at a successful harvest, increased profits and improved lives.\n\nThe field officer is included in the photo with the farmer-leaders, and is standing on the left of the photo."}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1487071,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to purchase hybrid seed and fertilizer for the\u00a0cultivation\u00a0of maize, millet, and sorghum.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kakamega North","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":3225,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosemary","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mercy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Melisa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jenipha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Margret","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Charles","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":278148,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":3225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":278148}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":3225}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":758781,"name":"Hamida's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Hamida is a member of this group from Iraq.

All of the women belonging to this bank have a least two businesses. <p>\r\nThey invest the money borrowed in different economic ventures like breeding bulls and pigs and selling chicken, vegetables, baked goods and other foods.  The also sell firewood, cosmetics and heliconia leaves (used to make tamales).<p>\r\nIt was impressive to see the entire group of women so decided about how they would be using the money that they were borrowing.  Norma M. commented that she was going to use a part of her loan to sell cosmetics while the other part would be invested in fruit to sell in the market.  Juana S. said that as soon as she received her loan, she was going to purchase 300 kg of chicken to sell in the market.  Mar\u00eda P., like the large majority of the group, was going to buy 150 bunches of heliconia leaves to then sell to distributors.  While the women sell one bunch of leaves for seven quetzals, a distributor can sell in the cities for double the price.  Mar\u00eda P. was going to invest her money in her tortilla business and in the purchase of firewood.<p>\r\nWhen asked why they like to work with Friendship Bridge, the women said that it was primarily because it gives them a chance to save money.  The inability to save is one of the reasons people can\u2019t get out of poverty.  Additionally, they said that the low interest and the timeframe the institution offered for repaying the loans help them with their businesses.  Also, working under the bank\u2019s methodology is something they like very much.<p>\r\nThe women believe that within the Barrio El Calvario Communal Bank they are all equal.  Not only that, but there is a lot of communication and understanding within the communal bank.  It seems that working with Friendship Bridge has changed their lives.  They are very grateful to the institution and to those who invest in them through Kiva because people have believed in them.  They are sure that they will not let us down.  That\u2019s why helping this and many other groups of women is important, because one gives them a chance and a ray of hope.<p><b>Translated form Spanish by Hugh Yarbrough, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<P>Dentro de este banco comunal uno puede encontrar mujeres corajudas y con una visi\u00f3n empresarial muy caracter\u00edstica de las empresarias de la costa de Guatemala. Todas las clientas dentro de este banco tienen dos negocios como m\u00ednimo.\r\n\r\n<P>Ellas invierten su cr\u00e9dito en distintas actividades econ\u00f3micas, tales como la crianza de toros y cerdos, venta de pollo, venta de comidas, venta de verduras, venta de le\u00f1a, venta ambulante de cosm\u00e9ticos, panader\u00eda y la venta de hojas de mashan (las cuales son usadas para envolver los tamales).\r\n\r\n<P>Fue impresionante ver a todo un grupo de mujeres tan decididas en que utilizar el pr\u00e9stamos que se les iba a otorgar. Norma M., coment\u00f3 que ella iba a usar parte de su pr\u00e9stamo para la venta de cosm\u00e9ticos que los iba a vender de manera ambulante, mientras que la otra parte la iba a invertir en la compra de fruta para venderla en el mercado. Juana S., dijo que a penas recib\u00eda su pr\u00e9stamo lo iba a invertir en la compra de tres quintales de pollos destazados para su venta en el mercado. Mar\u00eda P., como la gran mayor\u00eda del grupo, iba a comprar 150 racimos de hojas de mashan para luego venderlo a los intermediaros. Ellas venden un racimo a siete quetzales, mientras que un intermediario puede llegar a venderlo en las ciudades por el doble del precio. Mar\u00eda P., va a invertir su cr\u00e9dito en su tortilleria y en la compra de le\u00f1a. \r\n\r\n<P>Cuando se les pregunto porque les gusta trabajar con Friendship Bridge ellas comentaron que era primordialmente porque les daba un espacio para ahorrar. La falta de capacidad de ahorrar es uno de los motivos por los cuales las personas no pueden salir de la pobreza. Adicionalmente, dijeron que los bajos intereses y el plazo que les ofrec\u00eda la instituci\u00f3n las ayudaba con su negocio. Tambi\u00e9n, trabajar bajo metodolog\u00eda  de bancos comunales les gusta mucho. \r\n\r\n<P>Las se\u00f1oras opinan que dentro del banco comunal Barrio el Calvario todas son iguales. No solo eso, sino que hay mucha comunicaci\u00f3n y comprensi\u00f3n dentro del banco comunal. Al parecer trabajar con Friendship Bridge les ha cambiado la vida. Ellas agradecen mucho a la instituci\u00f3n y a las personas que invierten en ellas desde Kiva por que confiaron en ellas y est\u00e1n seguras de no nos van a defraudar. Es por eso que seguir apoyando a este y a muchos gruP. de mujeres es importante, ya que uno les da un respiro y una luz de esperanza."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":5000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":5000,"image":{"id":149354,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits &

It was founded in 1974. Today, it has a total of 750 pupils with a staff of twenty-three teachers. Since its inception in 1974, the school has produced many of the professionals in town and the country at large.\n\nThis Primary School continues to prove itself in both the academic arena and in sport. Ninety-eight percent of the pupils they sent last academic year for the National Primary School Exams (NPSE) had clear passes. This academic year, they expect to have a 100% passes at the NPSE.\n\nThis is the first loan the school is seeking from SMT.  With this loan, they will be able to invest in some petty-trading in order to supplement their monthly salaries. Some however will use theirs to either buy pieces of furniture or in constructing houses. This loan will definitely improve the economic status of these teachers. \n\nJohn B. C.

He is fifty-five years of age, married with six children between the ages of two and thirty-four. John is currently building a second home for himself.  He will use his loan to buy building materials to continue with the building process. This house will consist of three bedrooms, a parlor, a store and a toilet. Once he is finished building it, it will be an estimated value of Le 10,000,000 \u2013 Le 11,000,000 (approx. US$ 3000 \u2013 US$ 3600). \n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4575,"image":{"id":259976,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cement","sector":"Construction","themes":["Conflict Zones"],"use":"Buy building materials","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SL","country":"Sierra Leone","town":"Makeni","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"8.883333 -12.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":57,"posted_date":"2009-01-24T04:00:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":4575,"lender_count":134,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"John B.","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Peter C.","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"William D.","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Agnes M.","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Susan R.","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Zainabu ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Patrick S.","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Edwin S.

Tuao North, Bagabag, Nueva Vizcaya. She is 23 years old. Mary Joy is the group leader for a seven-member group loan offered by ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or default.\n\nMary Joy is married and has one school-aged child. To make a living, Mary Joy owns and operates a business making and selling food. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from preparing and selling pork and chicken barbeque. Mary Joy has been engaged in her business for over three years and earns approximately 5,000 PHP a month for these activities.\n\n\nIn 2008, Mary Joy joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Mary Joy has successfully repaid a previous loan of 13,000 PHP from ASKI. This loan was used to to purchase the raw ingredients needed to make products for sale. Mary Joy is requesting a new loan of 15,000 PHP which will be used to purchase new items to expand the range of products offered. This loan will be the fifth loan taken out by Mary Joy from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business. \n\n\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs. \n\n\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1725,"image":{"id":450781,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

The main source of income for the business comes from selling both food and daily use products in the local community. Enecita has been engaged in her business for over 13 years and earns approximately 8,000 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n<br>In 2009, Enecita joined Kiva partner, HSPFI, to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 8,000 PHP from HSPFI. This loan was used to invest in expanding the business. Enecita is requesting a new loan of 11,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase new items to expand her product offering. This loan will be her third from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated to improve and expand her business. \r\n<p>\r\n<b>About HSPFI<\/b><br>\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines.

After this she became pregnant. After her children died during the Mozambican Civil War, she became despondent. Her sister invited Lorta to live with her in the district of Namaacha on the border with Swaziland. After moving there she began to work as a domestic servant.\r\n\r\nWith her earnings, Lorta started her own business, and then built a house with the profit from that enterprise. However, due to expenses related to her son\u2019s wedding she is close to bankruptcy. For this reason she is asking for a loan in the amount of 8000 meticais to shore up her business. She works two days a week, Wednesdays and Saturdays, selling at an unofficial market where people trade in imported goods. She earns about 5000 meticais per month and uses this income to cover household expenses. She also saves some each month.\r\n\r\nThis is Lorta\u2019s 3rd loan with Hluvuku and her 2nd with Kiva. The first loan, in the amount of 8000 meticais, was used to help shore up her business. The second, in the amount of 10,000 meticais, was used to increase her stock of merchandise. This third loan, for 15,000 meticais, will be used for the same purpose, to buy packs of used clothing for resale. Lorta is confident that she will repay this loan even sooner than required so that she can get another loan to finish building a house for her son.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Catherine Fountain, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":548391,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Purchase of packs of used clothing","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MZ","country":"Mozambique","town":"Namaacha","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-25.970278 32.025556","type":"point"}},"partner_id":23,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":450,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lorta Uaquene","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-05-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MZN","disbursal_amount":15000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":18,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":659.14},{"due_date":"2010-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":688.93},{"due_date":"2010-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":720.08},{"due_date":"2010-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":752.63},{"due_date":"2010-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":786.65},{"due_date":"2010-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":822.21},{"due_date":"2010-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":859.38},{"due_date":"2011-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":898.23},{"due_date":"2011-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":938.84},{"due_date":"2011-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":981.28},{"due_date":"2011-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1025.64},{"due_date":"2011-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1072},{"due_date":"2011-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1120.46},{"due_date":"2011-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1171.11},{"due_date":"2011-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1224.05},{"due_date":"2011-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1279.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.77},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.67},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.6},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.58},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.6},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":24.67},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25.78},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.95},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.16},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.44},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.77},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.16},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.61},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.14},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.72},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.38}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"C.

Adjo Georgette was born in 1979 in Lom\u00e9. She is single. She is a master hairdresser with a dozen apprentices. She supports her parents,  brothers and sisters. After graduating first of her class, Georgette opened up a shop under a shed by the side of a road where she brilliantly practices her job. Despite the number of her apprentices, Miss S. is not anymore able to satisfy her customers because of lack of adequate equipment and the tightness of her shop. To establish her customer loyalty and to increase their number, she imperatively needs to open up another shop and to equip it by buying hairdryers, shampoos and others modern products. To do so requires financial means that she does not have. Therefore, she is soliciting a $1200 loan that she will pay back with her income which will triple with the acquisition of the projected equipment.\r\n<p> <b>Translated from [French] by [Bijou Kuzimbu], Kiva Volunteer. <\/b><p>\r\nMlle S.

The country is home to epic mountain passes, communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  Today it remains a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, and Central Asian traditions. \r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war that ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R. further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n<p>\r\n<b>About IMON International <\/b>\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1150,"image":{"id":303823,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing

G. is from the village of Malangka, Gingoog City, in the Philippines. She is twenty-four years-old and married with three young children. Marites owns and operates a mini-restaurant called a \"carenderia\".  While not the only revenue generator, the main source of income for the business comes from serving a variety of different meals to local customers. Marites has run her business for over four years and earns approximately 4,000 PHP per month from it.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2009, Marites joined Kiva partner HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Marites is requesting a loan of 5000 PHP which will be used to purchase food and drinks for the restaurant. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Marites from HSPFI. She plans to save the additional revenue generated from the business as a reserve for future emergencies. \r\n<p>\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n<p>\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines.

G. sells merchandise through catalogs such as men\u2019s and women\u2019s clothing, perfumes, and accessories.  She also produces hand-knitted purses, blouses, tablecloths, and fabrics.  Carmen is 34 years old and has two sons, ages 6 and 9.  She lives in the July 20th neighborhood of Barranquilla, which is a mixture of business and residential areas.  In this neighborhood, you will find shopping centers, supermarkets, the metropolitan soccer stadium, inns, taverns, and numerous residential buildings and houses.  \r\n<p>\r\nCarmen started her business in 2000 when a neighbor taught her how to knit.   She was still working as a salesperson at a department store in Barranquilla.  The birth of her son in 2001 forced her to quit her job so that she could dedicate herself to taking care of her baby.  Her customers consist of neighbors, friends, relatives, and people who have been recommended to her.  Although there is significant competition, she maintains her clientele because of the quality of her service and the prices she offers.  Every 21 days, she places orders for her catalog products and also purchases items that are not found in the catalogs but are frequently requested.  She has had three previous loans with the Foundation that have enabled her to increase her income and educate her children.  \r\n<p>\r\nWith this loan of 1,500,000 COP that she requested, Carmen will invest in the purchase of catalog merchandise such as clothing, perfumes, accessories, as well as wholesale yarn for cash.  She also plans to buy wooden utensils and ornaments made of stone.  Carmen says her biggest challenges are the lack of operating capital and not having her own home.  Sometime later, she dreams of buying a house and expanding her business with the loans provided by Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva

John Awah and they have brought forth five children. A woman who does not like to depend on the husband for all the family needs, and finding it so difficult to accomplish this task, Lum J. joined GHAPE in 1998. \r\n<p>\r\nShe also has been having marital problems which causes her to be sad all the time but she is appreciative of the fact that she is alive. Her desire is to give her children love and education. She states that she feels better each time she provides something small to her children. \r\n<p>\r\nHer inability to get investment capital which could consistently generate income for her to meet her children\u2019s needs is what motivated her to obtain a loan from GHAPE.\u2028\u2028With her loan she plans to buy a two-wheel motorcycle. She knows this business will succeed because she is located at a good business site and she is a good rider for the motorcycle. \r\n<p>\r\nShe plans to use the profits generated to sponsor her children in school and to cater for the basic needs of her family.\u2028She plans to pay her loan in 24 months. The first installment repayment shall be done on the fourth month of loan disbursement.\r\n<p>\r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon. GHAPE works toward the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach. Every client is trained in business management, basic health, life skills, financial management, profits and losses, and family values.\r\n<p>\r\nClients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement. GHAPE instills a sense of family and community within its clients and staff and has developed a strong bond of trust between the organization and its clients.\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":553184,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Motorcycle Transport","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"Purchase a two wheel motorcycle.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CM","country":"Cameroon","town":"Alabukam, Mankon, NW.

He is married, 30 years old, the father of a three-year old boy and a carpenter.\r\n\r\nHe explains that he chose this profession because he learned it as a child as his father was a carpenter and left him his tools so he'd be able to work. He says it is a good business that provides him with a good income. He is going to use the loan to invest in the purchase of materials to continue working, including wood, glue and paint.\r\n\r\nThe earnings he is getting out of the business benefit him and his family very much. He is now financially more secure, which is going to help now that his son is starting preschool and they will have to buy school materials for him. \r\n\r\nHe also says that his business is benefitting the community as there aren't many carpenters in the town and people used to have to go far to order what they need. That's no longer the case, as they now have Joiy's carpenter's worshop nearby.\r\n\r\nHis main goal is to see his son grow up and support him through his studies so that he can have a career and a good profession. He would also like a larger workshop to support his mother, who is a widow and whom he helps financially, and to improve his standard of living.\r\n\r\nHe mentions that all group members are very reliable and responsible workers now they have had the chance to know each other. \r\n\r\nJoniy would like to thank FRAC and KIVA because they have enabled him to own his own business and change his life and his family's. \r\n\r\nCosta Brava group members and their business activities are:\r\nJoniy D.

She has been a professional hairdresser for 11 years and  her salon is located in front of her house in Agla, a working-class neighborhood in the economic capital of B\u00e9nin. Along with her hairdressing services, she sells hair extensions, pomades, shampoos, conditioners, and rechargeable telephone cards.

The supplemental income generated from this small loan will allow her to improve day-to-day living conditions for her family, for example, the general comfort of her home. \r\n\r\nIn future, she would like to sell wholesale and also to have her very own home to live in.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is married to Angeles, a Jeepney (small bus) operator, and mother to their three children. She, together with her husband and children, manages their household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nSittinona operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a PHP 5 worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns her income by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 300 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 50,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nSittinona hopes to be able to expand soon, just as she dreams to be able to give her children a good and high quality education through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God which she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1175,"image":{"id":898742,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

Florence is 20 years old and lives in the town of Kachwamba in the Fort Portal region of Uganda. For the past two years, Florence has been working hard to manage her retail shop, which sells food and home supplies to local customers. \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Florence has requested a loan of 400,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to purchase more food items for resale, and will help Florence to generate greater profits and cover her family's medical expenses. Florence hopes that in the future she will be able to purchase land and build a house. \r\n\r\nFlorence is a member of BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. In addition to microfinance loans, the program provides both a safe place for young Ugandan women to take part in group activities, and a forum for life-skills training. The ELA program has increased Florence's future prospects by helping her to learn how to save money.

Iris used her first loan of 300 soles (about $100) to start a business selling cooked food.  With profits from this business, she was able to purchase a television and a refrigerator. Iris plans to use this loan of 1000 soles to purchase wood and roofing materials to construct a small kiosk from which to sell her products.

The members live in the city of Phiry, in Ollantaytambo district, in Urubamba province, in the department of Cusco. The area is characterized by its warm climate, its beautiful views, and its agriculture and cattle herding. \n\nFlorentina is a member of the Miskiuno communal bank. She is 58 years old, married, and the mother of five children, two of whom are still dependent on her (Aled y Elvis). Her husband works as a cook. Florentina works in agriculture and raises small animals, such as guinea pigs. She currently has 300 guinea pigs and she sells them to restaurants at a cost of 15.00 to 18.00 PEN per guinea pig. Things are going very well for her because her guinea pigs are known in the area for their quality. She has been selling them for two years. She has also belonged to the Miskiuno communal bank for two years. Her loan will be used to improve the roof where the guinea pigs live and also to buy feed for them. \n\nSome of the other members work in agriculture\u2014for example, Susana, Yolanda, Eloy, Silveria and Pablo. The rest work in a variety of activities, such as tailoring, food sales, crafts, food, vegetables, and animal fodder. \n\nThe members are worried because their sales have gone down due to the heavy rains that fell for three days in the city of Cusco. Their buyers work directly in the tourist traD. and tourism has fallen off considerably. Other members have their fields near the banks of the Vilcanota River; the river washed away their crops leaving nothing behind except unrecoverable losses. The members forge ahead despite the adversities of their climate. \n\nThe members are grateful for the opportunity they have been given and they promise to make their loan payments within the established time frame. \n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jennifer Day, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3800,"image":{"id":488066,"template_id":1},"video":{"id":1696,"youtubeId":"loAbrfIPrvg","title":"Kiva Entrepreneur  FLORENTINA from  Peru","thumbnailImageId":488066},"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Florentina needs the loan to improve the roof on the structure where her guinea pigs live and to buy food for them ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Urubamba - Urubamba - Cusco","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":119,"posted_date":"2010-02-25T17:30:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":3800,"lender_count":94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":" Florentina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Avelina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jesus","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yolanda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Soledad Nilda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Silveria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Exaltacin","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Eloy","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jeannethe","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Maria Antonieta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Pablo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bernardo","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yolanda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Susana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-01-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":10800,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":3800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":1628.22},{"due_date":"2010-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":1693.35},{"due_date":"2010-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1761.09},{"due_date":"2010-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1831.54},{"due_date":"2010-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1904.81},{"due_date":"2010-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1980.99}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":572.89},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":595.81},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":619.64},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":644.43},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":670.21},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":697.02}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":1168.86,"local_amount":3322.03,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T08:19:46Z","rounded_local_amount":3333.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128905969},{"amount":619.74,"local_amount":1761.36,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T09:48:39Z","rounded_local_amount":1767.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136633439},{"amount":644.5,"local_amount":1831.75,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T08:48:55Z","rounded_local_amount":1838.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144667861},{"amount":670.27,"local_amount":1904.99,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:24:09Z","rounded_local_amount":1911.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151851524},{"amount":696.63,"local_amount":1979.87,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T10:14:13Z","rounded_local_amount":1986.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159589883}],"funded_date":"2010-03-03T03:26:54Z","paid_date":"2010-08-15T10:14:13Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jennifer Day","image":null}},{"id":180230,"name":"Dok","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Dok K., 51, is married and resides with her children in Takeo Province, Cambodia.

She believes her business will succeed because of her prior success, ample client base, and increasing demand for her products. She hopes to use the profits from her business to pay for her children\u2019s school fees, pay salaries to individuals who manage her farm, purchase seeds for her farm, and reinvest in her business. She will use this loan to manage current afflictions in her life, such as the theft of a significant amount of money, and to build a house for her and her children.\r\n\r\nH.\u2019s loan will be provided through the Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE), a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon.

Every client is trained in business management, basic health, life skills, financial management, profits and losses, and family values. Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement. GHAPE instills a sense of family and community within its clients and staff and has developed a strong bond of trust between the organization and its

Irma can be seen in the photo among the group of women surrounded by the clothing which she sells. She sells second-hand clothing, and has done so for 24 years. She is requesting the loan in order to buy more winter clothing and to diversify her business for this season. Her fellow group members and her customers know her as a hard-working and responsible person. At the time of asking for this loan, she is very happy since it is a good season for the sale of winter and new year's clothes. She is 47 years old, attended school through the 9th graD., is married and has 3 daughters.

Ruzibibi is a hard working woman and since 2004 has dedicated herself to selling a variety of vegetables in the central market of Kanibadam. She characterized herself as happy and humble. She started her business with her savings, which she had accumulated over a long period of time. She is the mother of 4 children that she would like to offer an education to them as they are minors. Her biggest dream is to prepare her children to have professions so they don't have to suffer like she did since childhood working hard labor. To realize this dream, Ruzibibi now requests $800 USD for the term of 6 months. With this loan she wants to buy more goods to increase her earnings.  \r\n\r\n<strong>More about Tajikistan and IMON International<\/strong>\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road, the end of Alexander the Great's rule and for it\u2019s famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n \r\n<p>But, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\n<strong>IMON's History<\/strong>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is married to a farmer and has five children studying in elementary and secondary schools. Abject poverty is inevitable to them. Therefore, she commenced to buy and sell root crops and vegetables to their neighbors, relatives and friends.\r\n<p>\r\nRufina was hooked on the idea of putting up a little \"sari-sari\" (variety) store. She thought that their daily needs could be supplied by the income from the store. Not having enough capital to start a sari-sari store she joined Paglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative in October 2006 to access loan credit for additional capital. All these loans were repaid in a timely manner. She is a member in good standing.\r\n<p>\r\nThe loans from Paglaum MPC helped the couple send their children to school. She said it's no longer a losing battle facing everyday hardships, having her husband by her side to lend a hand. And she is truly thankful to Paglaum MPC for keeping them company in all their financial needs.\r\n<p>\r\nIn the future, the couple wishes to operate a bigger sari-sari store with a bakeshop in it. Heart\u2019s desire is to send their children to college and witness them successful in the

Canjusa, Pulupandan, Negros Occidental.\r\n\r\nLina joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1997 because she did not want her family to be wholly dependent on her husband's income, which was really not enough to support their needs especially with two growing kids. \r\n\r\nSo Lina ventured into seafood processing and sales. In the picture, Lina is shown posing in front of beds of krill being prepared for Ginamos production. Lina just paid off her previous loan of PHP 29,500.00. For this 16th loan cycle she needs to borrow PHP 15,000 to sustain her expanding business. \r\n\r\nHaving her own business has given her the confidence and the independence she wants in her married life. She realizes that earning her own income to help her husband support their children has made their family unit even stronger.\r\n \r\nWhat is Ginamos?\r\n\r\nGinamos is a generic Hiligaynon (the local dialect in Western Visayas) term for anything that is salted and aged to ferment - in Tagalog it is known as Bagoong. Ginamos can also refer to fermented salted fish, mussels, oysters, etc. but in general, the term Ginamos refers to mashed salted fermented krill - all the others must be qualified - e.g. Ginamos na isda (fermented salted fish) or Ginamos na Tahong (fermented salted mussels).\r\n\r\nGinamos is prepared by mashing sea salt and krill together until the salt is well mixed into the finely ground krill, then it is kept in containers to age until ready. Ginamos in Negros Island is usually moist but firm and sold by the block or smaller bricks. Vendors usually pre-cut the blocks into different sizes to offer the buyers a selection. People usually buy Ginamos either as a flavor enhancer to dishes like Pinakbet (a vegetable stew) or as a dish by itself. When cooked as a dish, it is usually mixed with vinegar and sauteed with lots of garlic and sometimes with fried pork rind, and is served with rice as a meal or with green mangoes as an appetizer.\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\nAbout NWTF:\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the calling of not just of a few but thousands of women. Through the alleviation program, these women have progressed from earning less than a measly $1 a day, to surpassing the realities beyond their dreams. They have learned to live a life where they can finally be called honorable. This is Project Dungganon.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":361805,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

Doracy saved every single penny in order to finally open her current storefront space here in the U.S. in 2006.\r\n\r\nNot knowing English, or being able to access capital from a bank, Doracy overcame many obstacles to build her dream here in the U.S. Fortunately, she has been able to learn some English in order to communicate with her clients and also plans to move to a bigger and better location later this year.\r\n\r\nThis is Doracy\u2019s third loan with ACCION USA, and she says that every one of her experiences has helped expand her business by allowing her to purchase more inventory, which she can find at better prices with cash rather than credit. She says that ACCION USA has made it possible for her to dream big, and she hopes to open a second store in a mall and be successful enough to buy her own house

Because of her good repayment performance with her previous loans, she was able to borrow several times in CCT\u2019s Cooperative. She is consistent in paying her dues because she used the money she borrowed to buy added stock for her store. Her business lets her earn a profit of 6,250 Philippine pesos per month.  \r\n\r\nNow, with your help, she would like to apply for a PHP 10,000 loan. This amount will be used as a source of added capital to her expanding business by allowing her to buy assorted canned goods, snacks, beverages and toiletries for her store.\r\n\r\nShe dreams that her store will continue to grow and become a mini grocery someday so that she can help with the schooling of her grandchildren. \r\n\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

He was not able to complete it due to lack of funds.  He wants to close it off in order to make it more secure.  He benefits from his neighbor\u2019s wall and in the future he will close off the rest of his property.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Hugo Reyes, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":540403,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":null,"use":"Building materials","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Managua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.150833 -86.268333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":98,"posted_date":"2010-05-18T05:40:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":250,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Eriberto Antonio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-05-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":5000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":555.56},{"due_date":"2010-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":555.56},{"due_date":"2010-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":555.56},{"due_date":"2010-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":555.56},{"due_date":"2010-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":555.56},{"due_date":"2010-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":555.56},{"due_date":"2010-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":555.56},{"due_date":"2011-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":555.56},{"due_date":"2011-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":555.52}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.78},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.78},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.77},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.78},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.78},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.78},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.78},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.77},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.78}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":42.64,"local_amount":852.87,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:00:26Z","rounded_local_amount":904.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151822088},{"amount":45.8,"local_amount":915.93,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T09:03:10Z","rounded_local_amount":971.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159562098},{"amount":20.07,"local_amount":401.31,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T09:18:05Z","rounded_local_amount":425.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166771007},{"amount":28.83,"local_amount":576.53,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-16T07:45:55Z","rounded_local_amount":611.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172204898},{"amount":29.6,"local_amount":592.09,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T12:03:41Z","rounded_local_amount":628.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177330595},{"amount":47.24,"local_amount":944.8,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T11:42:14Z","rounded_local_amount":1002.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182465751},{"amount":35.82,"local_amount":716.47,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-19T09:10:12Z","rounded_local_amount":760,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":189097890}],"funded_date":"2010-05-19T05:13:02Z","paid_date":"2011-01-19T09:10:12Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Hugo E.

Calamba Misamis Occidental. She is 35 years old. Rusell is married and has 1 school-aged child. To make a living, Rusell owns and operates a specialized retail store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling meat like pork and beef in the local community. Rusell has been engaged in her business for over 5 years and earns approximately 25000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Rusell joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Rusell has successfully repaid a previous loan of 30,000 PHP from GDMPC. This previous loan was used to to invest in expanding the business. Rusell is requesting a new loan of 50,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional inventory & working capital. This loan will be the sixth loan taken out by Rusell from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement the family's income. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three unit offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

which the majority are Haitian immigrants who live in the city of La Romana, where the economy depends on the sugar industry and on luxury tourism. It is becoming one of the most exclusive destinations in the Dominican Republic. There is a scarcity of potable water and of electricity, and there is a population of people from the Dominican Republic and Haitian immigrants. Their principle activity is new clothing sales.\r\n\r\nPatria is a single mom with three children. Her most difficult challenge has been to work for her children, in a different country with a different culture. She really enjoys working, and she doesn\u00b4t know what is to be lazy at home. Unless she is sick, she needs to be doing something, selling or doing household activities.\r\n\r\nPatria is very excited to receive her first loan from Esperanza International. She has had her business for about 10 years, when she began selling miscellaneous products. She is planning to invest her loan in the purchase of new clothes, especially spring and summer clothing. Easter is close and the weather is very warm; people are waiting to go to the beach and use light clothing. She plans to use her earnings to reinvest in her business and to provide all they need as a family. Thank you so much for supporting this group.

She is a very kind and hard-working woman who lives in her own home together with her husband, 47 year-old Jos\u00e9, and her four beloved children, who she would like to provide with a better quality of life.\r\n\r\nPochita has a food stall in her own home where she sells delicious meals.  The aroma that wafts from her delicious soups is enough to attract customers.  Her stall is very popular and she generally sells a lot throughout the whole morning.  Pochita has been in this business for three years and it has made her the money she needs to feed her children and pay for their education.  However, she feels that she will have more expenses in the future and will not have enough money to cover them.  For this reason, she would like to set up a restaurant where she can sell her delicious dishes more comfortably and also improve her income.  \r\n\r\nPochita enjoys chatting with her customers and enjoys her work but it is very difficult to serve all the people who come to her business.  However, she does not flag in her eagerness to get ahead in life and she is prepared to work very hard in order to achieve this.\r\n\r\nThis will be Pochita's twelfth loan from MFP and she hopes to receive the support of each and every one of you.  Pochita will use the 2,000 Peruvian soles she has requested to buy more ingredients with which to prepare the food that she sells."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":800659,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

Ica is located in the Sechura Desert almost four hours south of Lima, the national capital, and is acclaimed by Peruvians as \u201cThe Land of the Sun.\u201d  It\u2019s noted in Peru for its frequent earthquakes (an 8.0 in 2007 and a 6.9 in 2011), its grape, asparagus and olive production and, above all, as the source of Peru\u2019s traditional, national beverage: Pisco.\r\n\r\nIn this hot, arid weather we find our client\u2019s home and business.  In his spare time he enjoys repairing motorcycles.  As he well knows, Peru is known for having the most delicious food in the world and one of Guillermo\u2019s favorite dishes is \u201cSeco de Cabrito.\u201d  Guillermo studied up to eleventh grade due to his parent\u2019s economic problems; he would have liked to study Auto Mechanics.\r\n\r\nGuillermo works as a mototaxi driver but his drive to get ahead is so strong that he also works very hard in his motorcycle repair shop.  He spends about 11 hours daily at both jobs and tells us that without sacrifice, there is no growth.  His friends encouraged him because he\u2019s very skilled in vehicle repair and because he knows how to drive and is a very prudent driver.\r\n\r\nIn a typical day, Guillermo can tend to 50 customers which produces a 30-sol daily profit for him and on a good day he might earn up to 60 soles which helps him cover some additional household expenses or to invest in the business.  He believes that he does well in his business because he finishes his jobs on time, he\u2019s honest and responsible but, above all, very honest and this is why his customers seek him out and recommend him to others.\r\n\r\nGuillermo is very grateful to Kiva lenders because he\u2019ll be able to use the loan to remodel his workshop and his house.  This improvement will help him have a better environment in which to carry out his work and this will create a better quality of life since his income will improve and in a few months he\u2019d like to have a larger workshop that will help him reach his great dream: \u201cTo have his own house.\u201d\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":969590,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Motorcycle Repair","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to remodel his shop and his house.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ica","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":139,"posted_date":"2011-12-30T18:10:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":575,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Guillermo Felix","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-12-29T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":99.65},{"due_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","amount":106.75},{"due_date":"2012-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":110.52},{"due_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":113.02},{"due_date":"2012-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":118.45},{"due_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":121.49},{"due_date":"2012-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":126.93},{"due_date":"2012-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":130.59},{"due_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":135.37},{"due_date":"2012-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":140.86},{"due_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":145.48},{"due_date":"2012-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":150.89}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.2},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.92},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.37},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.32},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.41},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.57},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.65},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.06},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.9},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.99},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.77},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.84}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":38.2,"local_amount":99.65,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T09:46:01Z","rounded_local_amount":102.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257142565},{"amount":40.92,"local_amount":106.75,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T08:57:52Z","rounded_local_amount":110.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263271159},{"amount":42.37,"local_amount":110.52,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T08:45:28Z","rounded_local_amount":114.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":269993808},{"amount":43.32,"local_amount":113.02,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T08:58:20Z","rounded_local_amount":116.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276601712},{"amount":45.41,"local_amount":118.45,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T11:36:05Z","rounded_local_amount":122.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283090840},{"amount":364.78,"local_amount":951.61,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:08:35Z","rounded_local_amount":983.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294298003}],"funded_date":"2012-01-24T18:08:00Z","paid_date":"2012-08-15T09:08:35Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":381254,"name":"Meriam","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Meriam is 48 years old and married with 12 children.
