She and her family live in Silang, Cavite, a province just South of Manila.\r\n\r\nArline has been a regular member of Center for Community Transformation* (CCT) for three years. She regularly attends their weekly fellowship meetings and pays her weekly dues consistently. Because of her good repayment performance with her previous loans, she was able to borrow twelve times from CCT\u2019s Cooperative. The reason why she was consistent in paying her loans was because she used almost all of the money she borrowed to buy and sell assorted feeds to her increasing consumer base.\r\n\r\nNow with your help, she would like to apply for a PHP 26,000 loan. This amount will be mostly used to buy additional stocks of rice, different beverages and assorted canned goods for her variety store.\r\n\r\nShe prays that her business will continue to grow so that one day it will become a mini-grocery. She hopes that some day they will have enough money to send their child to college and that they will have a chance to travel around the world.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

He lives with his parents in the small town of La Pava, Mochum\u00ed district, located an hour from the city of Chiclayo.\r\n\r\nHe has worked as a farmworker since he was very young, and he works in various fields in the area. This work does not provide enough stability to cover his expenses and also help his parents. For this reason, for a year he has also been working selling firewood and raising animals.  \r\n\r\nJuan buys the trunks of recently cut carob trees from sellers in the area and he cuts them in smaller pieces so that he can offer them to his customers in  \u201carmadas\u201d (bundles of firewood) containing 30 units. He also raises barnyard animals to sell to merchants who visit the area from time to time. \r\n\r\nHis firewood business is useful in the area where he lives because the majority of families there use firewood for cooking. For this reason Juan is planning to expand his business, and is requesting a first-time loan of 1000 Peruvian soles from Edpyme Alternativa. He will invest the money in the purchase of more carob tree trunks with which he can get more customers.\r\n\r\nJuan is well known in the area in which he lives. His neighbors and customers hold him in great esteem. His greatest wish is to help his parents get ahead and to offer them a better quality of life.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Catherine Fountain, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":468811,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Purchase of carob tree trunks in order to sell firewood.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"La Pava - Mochum\u00ed - Lambayeque","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":143,"posted_date":"2010-01-13T18:20:18Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juan","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-01-11T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":68.77},{"due_date":"2010-03-11T08:00:00Z","amount":74.09},{"due_date":"2010-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":72.6},{"due_date":"2010-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":77.65},{"due_date":"2010-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":78.54},{"due_date":"2010-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":81.16},{"due_date":"2010-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":84.46},{"due_date":"2010-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":85.69},{"due_date":"2010-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":90.77},{"due_date":"2010-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":92.57},{"due_date":"2010-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":95.45},{"due_date":"2011-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":98.25}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.07},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.93},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.41},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.18},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.49},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.4},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.56},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.77},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.4},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.4},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.39}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":24.07,"local_amount":68.77,"processed_date":"2010-02-11T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T09:47:11Z","rounded_local_amount":69.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123900360},{"amount":25.93,"local_amount":74.09,"processed_date":"2010-03-11T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T08:45:28Z","rounded_local_amount":75.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128934520},{"amount":25.41,"local_amount":72.6,"processed_date":"2010-04-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:08:50Z","rounded_local_amount":73.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136662132},{"amount":27.18,"local_amount":77.65,"processed_date":"2010-05-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:06:57Z","rounded_local_amount":78.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144694837},{"amount":27.49,"local_amount":78.54,"processed_date":"2010-06-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:38:10Z","rounded_local_amount":79.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151877889},{"amount":28.4,"local_amount":81.16,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T10:50:52Z","rounded_local_amount":82.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159617928},{"amount":29.56,"local_amount":84.46,"processed_date":"2010-08-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:01:31Z","rounded_local_amount":85.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166832335},{"amount":30,"local_amount":85.69,"processed_date":"2010-09-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T09:56:25Z","rounded_local_amount":86.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172098955},{"amount":131.96,"local_amount":377.04,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-16T10:43:32Z","rounded_local_amount":382.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177554415}],"funded_date":"2010-01-13T22:47:48Z","paid_date":"2010-11-16T10:43:32Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"C.

It is located in the south-east part of the city and has a population of 50 million.  Milena began her business of selling perfumes, clothing, shoes, and cosmetics five years ago because she needed to earn her own income.  She got a loan from her family and since she is well organized, was able to grow her business over time.

This enabled her to improve her quality of life.\r\n\r\nHer primary goal is to make her business stand out by creating an infrastructure that will allow her to showcase her products.  In other words, she would like to have her own point of sale.  Her dream is that her young son gets the best education possible and she is working toward that.  Now her only challenge is collecting the money that some of her customers owe her, because some have not kept up with their payments and she has had to be patient and renegotiate their debts.

Sangi Riverside, Toledo City, Cebu. She earns her living by operating two business ventures: a sari-sari (general) store and a house for rental. Her husband Pablo L. is 58 years old and helps in his wife's business activities. They have three children who are 31 to 35 years old. \r\n\r\nNelia  joined NWTF - Project Dungganon in 1999 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 17 cycle loans from NWTF - Project Dungganon, Nelia  has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 25,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 26,400, thus uplifting the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 18th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 29,500, which she intends to use to fund her business operations so that she can continue to save up for the future of her family. Nelia is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed on a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work. \r\n\r\nHelp NWTF continue its mission to help the poorest in the Philippines by clicking the link to the NWTF Kiva lending team on Kiva.org to join our

Ryskul lives in a town called Karabalta with her husband and two children ages 5 and 3. Ryskul started her business career at a very young age and by this time has reached impressive outcomes. The couple has been involved in cattle breeding since they started living together. But three years ago they decided to quit this business and start something new. After reviewing the best options, and their own skills, Ryskul and her husband opened a small caf\u00e9.\r\n\r\nThe first challenge in making a business plan was choosing the location. There were too many cafes in their hometown, so they looked for a less competitive environment. The perfect spot was the busiest route in the country, connecting two major centers, Bishkek and Osh. Every day thousands of passenger buses and cars take this route. There are picturesque views and sightseeing, but the passengers complain of having a lack of places to stop for lunch. Ryskul and her husband sold all of their cattle and invested the revenue in building a caf\u00e9. It has been three years, and Ryskul\u2019s expectations turned into reality. Ryskul is the chief cook and her husband is the manager and a caterer of all necessary supplies. The family was able to buy new furniture for their house and an automobile. The profits from the business have reached 40,000 monthly, but along with it the inflation and transportation costs have increased the caf\u00e9\u2019s expenses. Ryskul is requesting a loan in order to buy some inputs and raw materials for running the caf\u00e9. If everything goes well, Ryskul dreams of opening another small shop near her caf\u00e9. \r\n\r\n       --- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance (MBF), a young, ambitious and socially-focused Microfinance Institution in Kyrgyzstan. \r\nMBF is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development and upholds the triple bottom line \u2013 People (building human capital and taking care of its customers as well as society), Planet (keeping environmentally friendly) and Profit (earning revenue to expand autonomously).

She\u2019s married and has five children ranging in ages from 16 to 34.  Lilia is a woman with much risk capacity in business, she says.  Since 1992 she\u2019s been working in various businesses.  First she sold chicken in restaurants.  In 1993 she had rented a restaurant and went into food sales.  In 1994 she started a business selling merchandise, especially shoes that she\u2019d bring from Bucaramanga and when her husband started working for a firm they opened a store.  They bought display cases that they stocked with a variety of products displaying them well, a business that today she runs with a profit margin no less than 7% selling paper goods, school supplies, natural remedies, toys, accessories and home decorations.  Her customers are primarily her neighbors that she sells to for cash.  She also has a select group of customers that she sells to on credit.\r\n\r\nHer Kiva loan is the second loan she\u2019s gotten from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  She will use it to pay cash for a large volume of stationery supplies, which is the merchandise with the highest turnover rate.  This will mean a higher profit margin for her thanks to the discounts she\u2019ll get paying cash.\r\n\r\nSince getting her first loan she\u2019s managed to regularize her business in the municipal Chamber of Commerce.  Now her goal for later on is to add a restaurant specializing in the food of Santander to her store and to continue running her household with the dream of seeing it prosper more each day.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":772727,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":" to buy stationery supplies for cash and in larger volume.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Soledad Atl\u00e0ntico","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2011-05-20T19:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":600,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lilia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-05-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1070000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":83053},{"due_date":"2011-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":99685},{"due_date":"2011-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":101595},{"due_date":"2011-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":103542},{"due_date":"2011-11-05T07:00:00Z","amount":105527},{"due_date":"2011-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":107550},{"due_date":"2012-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":109611},{"due_date":"2012-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":111712},{"due_date":"2012-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":113853},{"due_date":"2012-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":133872}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.57},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.9},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.97},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.06},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.17},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.31},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":61.47},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.64},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.84},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.07}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":46.57,"local_amount":83053,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:49:31Z","rounded_local_amount":84993.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221673734},{"amount":55.9,"local_amount":99685,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-17T08:01:53Z","rounded_local_amount":102014.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227320297},{"amount":56.97,"local_amount":101595,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:06:29Z","rounded_local_amount":103968.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232803427},{"amount":58.06,"local_amount":103542,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:17:27Z","rounded_local_amount":105961.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238614501},{"amount":59.17,"local_amount":105527,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:59:16Z","rounded_local_amount":107992.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244568467},{"amount":60.31,"local_amount":107550,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:07:09Z","rounded_local_amount":110062.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250779810},{"amount":61.47,"local_amount":109611,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T10:21:34Z","rounded_local_amount":112172.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257188218},{"amount":62.64,"local_amount":111712,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:36:06Z","rounded_local_amount":114322.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263324444},{"amount":63.84,"local_amount":113853,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T09:31:55Z","rounded_local_amount":116513.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270038507},{"amount":75.07,"local_amount":133872,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:43:42Z","rounded_local_amount":136999.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276650697}],"funded_date":"2011-05-24T20:24:28Z","paid_date":"2012-05-15T09:43:42Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":303849,"name":"Roberto Carlos","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Roberto padre de familia de 29 a\u00f1os de edad, vive con su esposa y su hijo en su  casa propia; no cuenta con los servicios b\u00e1sicos, ubicada  en la zona rural del distrito de Olmos, a una hora de distancia del departamento de Lambayeque.

The bananas she sells arrive directly and daily from the forests outsiD. her city of Ayacucho, Per\u00fa. These she is able to sell all year round, Dolores explains, and she sells some seven different varieties from extremely small bananas to very large and round and even red bananas. Dolores also sells whatever type of fruit happens to be in season, for example, today one can find a wiD. variety of pineapples, mangos, and papayas.\r\n<p>\r\nYear before, Dolores was an \u201cambulante,\u201d which means she sold in the markets, but without a fixed stand, having to cart her fruits around with her all day long. She was also only able to stock smaller amounts of fruits which came from the capital city of Lima, instead of fresh from the forests and harvesters in the countrysiD.. It was only through very hard work that Dolores was eventually able to earn her own stand within the market, and it is with that same diligence that she continues to work everyday from 3 am to 6 pm, doing everything within her power to continue growing her business and her clientele. Her goal she says is to open a second stand next door, from which she would expand her market and sell spices.\r\n<p>\r\nWith the help of loans from her village bank, Dolores has been able to grow her business and support her family of a husband and seven children. She says she is infinitely grateful to have received the economic help through miroloans, something that has taught her how to manage her business in a responsible and punctual fashion. Dolores is requesting a loan of $500, with which she will be able to buy and sell even larger quantities of bananas, facilitating greater profits."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":84950,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Market","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Buy and sell larger quantities of bananas.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":70,"posted_date":"2007-11-18T23:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":500,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Dolores","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-12-03T02:29:13Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1495,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":373.75},{"due_date":"2008-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":373.75},{"due_date":"2008-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":373.75},{"due_date":"2008-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":373.75}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":125}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":125,"local_amount":373.75,"processed_date":"2008-01-03T10:22:45Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-03T10:27:15Z","rounded_local_amount":374.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":107574},{"amount":125,"local_amount":373.75,"processed_date":"2008-02-03T10:15:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-03T10:27:15Z","rounded_local_amount":374.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":127463},{"amount":125,"local_amount":373.75,"processed_date":"2008-03-03T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-03T10:27:15Z","rounded_local_amount":374.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":148186},{"amount":125,"local_amount":373.75,"processed_date":"2008-04-03T10:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-03T10:27:15Z","rounded_local_amount":374.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172609}],"funded_date":"2007-11-19T02:29:13Z","paid_date":"2008-04-03T10:10:34Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":28489,"name":"Makhmadrozik","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Makhmadrozik B. lives in Mastchokh; he is married and has 3 children.

Francisco is married and has 5 children. All children are currently attending school.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 1971, Francisco moved to Boane, a village 30Km away from the capital city Maputo, with his family. He studied until 8th grade and stopped because of financial and transportation difficulties. The secondary school was located in Maputo and public buses or mini-buses were almost inexistent and very expensive. Francisco started to work with his father, a goldsmith. Francisco and his father used to buy raw materials in Maputo, but with the Mozambican civil war, they started buying in the north of the country instead, which increased their production costs.\r\n<p>\r\nToday Francisco has a small store in Boane where he sells his jewellery as well as clothes. Francisco makes earrings, rings and necklace with red gold, the local available raw material.  Francisco buys the gold in Maputo at MTn 600 per gram. Earrings are his most popular products and are sold for MTn 250 to MTn 2,500. Francisco\u2019s wife works at the store and they make between MTn 3,000 to MTn 6,000 per day. The other products that Francisco sells he buys in Maputo 3 times per week, going with public transportation. \r\n<p>\r\nThis will be Francisco\u2019s third loan with Hluvuku and first with Kiva. The first MTn 10,000 was used to buy raw materials to work as a goldsmith. The second loan of MTn 30,000 was used to start a wood business that didn\u2019t work out. Francisco planned to buy wood in the north of the country and sell in Maputo, but as he was new to the business he didn\u2019t forecast all the difficulties and failed. This third loan of MTn 12,000 will again be used to buy raw material (mainly gold), so that Francisco can produce many products to sell. He would like to increase his store\u2019s inventory to attract more clients and increase his monthly income.\r\n<p>\r\nIn the future Francisco would like to have a gold manufacturing company, producing earrings and rings in large quantities and selling to all jewellers in Maputo."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":161533,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Jewelry","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Buy

Working the soil and caring for plants is part of his life.  Since his childhood he has carried out these jobs, but last year he wasn't able to do the planting he wanted because of an increase in fertilizer prices.  The price rose to 215 soles per sack where it had been 60 soles.  Because of this difficulty, the money he had for that investment was not enough to cover the cost.

He leaves daily to graze his animals in distant fields, some a three-hour's walk away. Sometimes he takes his children when they have free time from school. Once they are grown, he sells the animals at his town's livestock market, and the profitability has allowed him to have sustained success with household expenses.

Barbara, Pangasinan. She is 35 years old and is the group leader of an 8-member group loan offered by ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is Marissa B. Group.\r\n\r\nMarissa is married and has 3 school-aged children. To make a living, Marissa owns and operates a business venture in the food sector, operating a butcher shop in the market. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from butchering and selling a variety of meats in the market. Marissa has been engaged in her business for over 1 year and earns approximately 6000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Marissa joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Marissa has successfully repaid a previous loan of 15000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional products to sell. Marissa is now requesting a new loan of 20000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional inventory and working capital. This loan will be the fourth loan taken out by Marissa from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to financially support immediate members of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2675,"image":{"id":507027,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Butcher Shop","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To purchase additional inventory and working capital","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Sonquil, Sta.

Daisy passionately loves poultry farming, but the biggest challenge she faces is a lack of capital to buy quality breeds of poultry that are resistant to diseases and lay more eggs. \n\nDaisy is seeking a loan to purchase additional poultry. She will use her excess maize to feed the poultry and will provide sorghum to give the poultry energy and green grams (beans) for protein. Through better feeding, the poultry will increase their egg production and will lay more eggs that are of good quality, which will translate to more income. Apart from an increase in egg production, she will get increased output from poultry meat, and this will further increase her income and profit margins. Through increased profits, she intends to turn around her living conditions and live a better life. \n\nIn addition to profits, Daisy will benefit from chicken manure, which contains the highest amount of nitrogen of any livestock manure and is very valuable as fertilizer. She will be able to save money that would have been spent to buy fertilizer. \n\nThanks to your support, Daisy will succeed in making her dreams come true; take action and give a loan!\n"}},"status":"inactive","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":2027407,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy poultry.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kericho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":200,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Daisy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-10-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":1415.46},{"due_date":"2016-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":1456.83},{"due_date":"2016-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":1499.4},{"due_date":"2016-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1543.2},{"due_date":"2016-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1588.32},{"due_date":"2016-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1634.74},{"due_date":"2016-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1682.52},{"due_date":"2016-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1731.69},{"due_date":"2016-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1782.3},{"due_date":"2016-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1834.38},{"due_date":"2016-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1887.99},{"due_date":"2016-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":1943.17}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":14.16},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":14.57},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.99},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.43},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.88},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.35},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.83},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.32},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.82},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.34},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.88},{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":19.43}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":993089,"name":"Eunice","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Eunice is 57 years old.

For that reason he is applying for a loan of 925 dollars for the purchase of merchandise. He commits to repaying the loan in a period of 5 to 10 months. You can help Ricardo. Your collaboration will be of great service to this family, and they appreciate your support. <p><b>Translated from Spanish by Erin Corcoran, Kiva volunteer. <\/b><p><p>Ricardo es casado y tiene cinco hijos de 27, 25, 14, 8 y 5 a\u00f1os de edad, desde hace quince a\u00f1os empez\u00f3 vendiendo afuera de su casa tostadas y helados, y despu\u00e9s vendi\u00f3 juguetes y obtuvo buenos resultados.

He sells his harvest in a local market, and with a great deal of effort has managed to increase his production little by little. Thanks to his investment, he has seen his earnings increase month by month, and these bring him his daily wages and the full satisfaction of his needs.  With his constant hard work, he has decided to continue expanding his labor in order to diversify his crops and bring employment to more farmers in his community.

For the last two years Vicky has run a small store which is not  currently operating, as the products had to be stored in a safe place during construction on her home. Once she has had her baby, Vicky plans on restocking her products to take up her daily routine once again. Currently she sells fried food from the door of her home in the evenings and during the day.

She sells different kinds of fruits and vegetables in Baclaran, a place far away from her home. Most of the fruit she sells come from various villages in the town where she lives. She gathers them all together and delivers by truck, or commonly known as a \u201cbackload\u201d in the village. She also goes to Baclaran and personally sells the fruit. The income she generates from selling fruit is being used to purchase other products, such as clothes, which she sells in the village. \r\n\r\nFelomena is requesting a loan amounting to PHP 4,000 to have additional capital for her retail business. She aims to further expand her business and she needs capital to be able to purchase more products. In this way, her income will increase. She hopes that her loan request will be granted.\r\n\r\nFelomena is 50 years old, but for her, age doesn\u2019t matter in business. She just hopes to remain strong and healthy to pursue what she started in business. Her family owns more than a hectare of farmland and it is being cultivated by her humble husband, Damian. They have four children, but they did not pursue their studies due to early marriage. She hopes that with the help of her business, she can manage to give a little help to her children.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":100,"image":{"id":403997,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits &

The owner of the said land is claiming his rights for personal reasons. Before his demand takes effect, Marianne hopes to have put up a savings fund through her transportation business. The business is managed by her husband and financed by the loan she availed from ASHI. Her membership to ASHI institution started in 2000. Since then she has received several loans, which enabled her to maintain the tricycle (motorcycle with sidecar) for hire and to support their family's needs. Marianne\u2019s parents gave the tricycle to her and her husband so that they could have their own source of income. As this tricycle has been used since 2004, its motor engine is no longer efficient. The sidecar is also very old and has to be repainted to be able to look nice and appealing to the passengers.\r\n\r\nMarianne and her husband agreed to request for a larger loan so that they can purchase a brand new motorcycle. The repairs to the old one would cost a huge amount of money. Some of the money will be spent for repairs and repainting of the sidecar. Marianne is hopeful that once they have all these for their business, their income will grow and she will be able to have a savings fund. She hopes to save enough money to build their own house someday on the land owned by her husband's parents. Their old motorcycle will still be operating as a rental to have more profits to support her only child\u2019s education until graduating from college.

In order to make a life for his kids, Pedro had to do various things, one of which was farming.  He began around 30 years ago, and learned a lot of cultivation techniques, because of which his oranges, tangelos, starfruit and mangoes are the most well-known in the area and the most coveted in the central market in the capital.  In addition to that business, he works in public transport, covering the route from Santa Ana to La Merced.  \r\n\r\nHe belongs to the village ban \"Los Caramboleros\" and this is his third loan with MFP, where he promises to be a responsible and punctual member.  Pedro is in the middle of the mango harvest; for that reason, he is planning to use this loan to buy some packing crates for his fruit.  He also will buy some compost to spread over the rest of his fields.

Because of this, their products are the most in demand. Her main source of income is the sale of cacao, coffee and plantains. She has 38,400 meters of cultivated land. She sells her products in the city of San Francisco and at harvest time hires day laborers to help in the planting and harvest of her products. What she likes the most about her work is the harvest, because it is the reward after so much hard work and dedication to her plants. She has been doing this for 20 years and thinks that the hardest thing is protecting her crops from insects, since they are constantly attacking her plantings. Over time, she wants to acquire new land and to increase her crops. That is why she is asking for support to make this wish come true. This is her ninth loan with MFP. She has paid her previous loans off on time and had worked with no trouble in her community bank. With the loan she has asked for, she will buy fertilizers to improve the quality of her production. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":782019,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Green"],"use":"to buy fertilizers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"CUSCO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.518333 -71.978056","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-05-31T15:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":750,"lender_count":29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juliana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-05-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":750}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":750,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:42:36Z","rounded_local_amount":2061,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244621309}],"funded_date":"2011-05-31T18:43:13Z","paid_date":"2011-12-15T10:42:36Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ellen Donohue","image":541577}},{"id":307978,"name":"Girlita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Girlita, is married with three children.

Aba will use the loan to purchase more fresh fish to smoke for sale. With the new profits from her expanded business, Aba plans to reinvest for further growth.\r\nTo smoke the fish, you need to go to the sea shore to buy fresh fish from the fishermen.  When you come home with the fish, you clean them. Once you drain the water from the fish, the fish will be ready to be smoked. Firewood and a traditionally-built oven are prepared to smoke the fish. The cooking time for the fish varies depending on the size of the fish and their arrangement in the oven. \r\nThe most important thing about this process is that it is the smoke, not the fire, that cooks the fish. The smoke gives the fish its dark color. Green leaves are used as coverings for the fish to prevent the smoke from escaping into the air. The heat should also be moderate as too much heat would not allow the fish to cook properly.\r\nCape Coast is a town in the Central Region of Ghana that is known to be a fishing community.

She has a small piece of land where she plants rice, corn, plantains and cacao. She also has a small business in the small town of Baba, where she sells juice, tortillas and snacks. She is applying for the loan because she wants to buy pigs that she will eventually sell as a secondary source of income. She will also invest in her land to produce rice. She has twins who are currently living in Guayaquil because they want to go to school. Clara has been trying to help them study but is having a hard time paying for their school and living expenses. Clara\u2019s dream is to help her two sons graduate as professionals from a good school in the large city. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Communal Banking in Baba<\/h4> \r\n<p>This borrower is part of the newest and largest Communal Bank in the recently developed Mifex Rural Finance Program. All of the members of the Centro Agricola de Baba Communal Bank are part of an Association of Rice Farmers in the county of Baba in rural Ecuador. Their association works cooperatively to cultivate rice and commercialize the product after it has grown. As an association, Centro Agricola helps the farmers by providing access to machinery and training services. The farmers from Centro Agricola have received special instruction on financial responsibility and accounting from Codemicro, an organization that specializes in training programs geared towards the rural sector.  \r\n<\/p> \r\n<p>The members of Centro Agricola de Baba will use the micro-loans to prepare their land and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each others' guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the Centro Agricola de Baba Association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many micro-finance programs, but Mifex believes that is imperative for the communities we work with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties. <\/p> \r\n<p><em>Below is more information about Santa Lucia compiled by Luis Crespo and Robert Edgar of the Mifex team when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. <\/em><\/p> \r\n<h4>Economy of Baba<\/h4> \r\n<p>The people of Baba have been organized since the days of Gran Colombia when Ecuador was yet to be a country. The area has always been popular because of the extremely productive land that gave way to cultivation of cacao for decades. Now Baba is a county in the province of Los Rios in the coastal region of Ecuador. For most of the latter part of the 20th Century it was a cacao and banana producing sector. Most of the surrounding areas of Baba in Los Rios are owned by large mulitnational  \r\ncompanies such as Dole, but Baba is a sector characterized by the small and informal farms. <\/p>\r\n<p>Rice production has now turned into the main economic activity of the sector as about 80% of the people are rice farmers. Cacao is still very popular in the area, but because of the long cultivation cycle people prefer to invest in rice. The land in Baba is very fertile though, and most farmers in the sector often grow other crops, such as plantains and soy beans  \r\nas secondary sources of income.  Many farmers also keep livestock as emergency sources of food and income, commonly resorting to selling a chicken or pig if they are in need of cash. <\/p> \r\n<h4>Rice Farming in Santa Lucia<\/h4> \r\n<p>Most of the people in the Baba area are small farmers. They produce about 80 sacks of rice per hectare of land. In order to farm, they first must prepare the land by removing weed, plowing and leveling it. This is the most difficult part for the farmers in Baba, who often lack the necessary machinery to properly plow the land for rice production. After appropriately preparing the land, the farmers fill an area with water to form what is known as a paddy field, because rice is a very water intensive crop. The rice seeds are either dispersed freely (the process is known as boleo in Spanish) or hand sowed. Once the rice has grown, most farmers rent machinery that helps them gather their production. <\/p> \r\n<h4>Access to Credit<\/h4> \r\n<p>One of the biggest struggles in the area has been the lack of credit due to the absence of any type of financial institution. \r\nBecause people do not count on formal financial support, they have turned to loan sharks for financing. They have been affected by expensive lines of credit that exceed 100% interest a year and can be as expensive as 240%. Intermediaries also exploit the farmers because of their outstanding debt. Farmers also lack skills and knowledge to commercialize their products and pay fair prices for their crops. <\/p> \r\n<h4>Risks<\/h4> \r\n<p>The largest risk in the sector is due to absence of watering systems. Although Baba is in the province \u201cLos Rios\u201d (the rivers), there is severe problem with access to water. The lack of infrastructure in the sector does not allow the small farmers to benefit from the presence of the many rivers in the area. If the winter season is too dry, it is likely that the lands will not be sufficiently fertile for rice production in the summer. On the other hand, if there is too much rain there are not any drainage systems to prevent flooding and the crops are often ruined. Generally speaking though, Baba is a very productive sector where the lands yield all types of crops including rice, cacao, corn, watermelons, plantains, and soy beans. <\/p> \r\n<h4>Loan Use<\/h4> \r\n<p>The loans in this sector will mostly be used to to buy soil, seeds, fertilizer and insecticides. Many clients will use the capital towards renting machinery and equipment necessary to effectively work and prepare the fields. Clients also typically use a part of the loan to buy livestock in order to raise and have as reserves. The loan repayment schedule is different from the typical micro-entrepreneur because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures. Mifex asks our rural clients only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 6 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the seventh and final month. <\/p>\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":25798,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Invest in raising pigs","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Baba","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-1.783333 -79.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":7,"posted_date":"2007-04-11T00:42:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":675,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Clara","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-04-25T06:18:40Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":675,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2007-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2007-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2007-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2007-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2007-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2007-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2007-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":112.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":113,"local_amount":113,"processed_date":"2007-06-18T09:15:19Z","settlement_date":"2007-11-20T03:39:42Z","rounded_local_amount":113,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":23988},{"amount":113,"local_amount":113,"processed_date":"2007-07-18T09:15:18Z","settlement_date":"2007-11-20T03:39:42Z","rounded_local_amount":113,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":33163},{"amount":113,"local_amount":113,"processed_date":"2007-08-18T09:15:13Z","settlement_date":"2007-11-20T03:39:42Z","rounded_local_amount":113,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":43864},{"amount":113,"local_amount":113,"processed_date":"2007-09-18T09:15:15Z","settlement_date":"2007-11-20T03:39:42Z","rounded_local_amount":113,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":55853},{"amount":113,"local_amount":113,"processed_date":"2007-10-18T09:15:15Z","settlement_date":"2007-11-20T03:39:42Z","rounded_local_amount":113,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":68795},{"amount":110,"local_amount":110,"processed_date":"2007-11-18T10:15:12Z","settlement_date":"2007-11-20T03:39:42Z","rounded_local_amount":110,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":82912}],"funded_date":"2007-04-11T06:18:40Z","paid_date":"2007-11-18T10:15:12Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":12136,"name":"Vannary","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Vannary has been married for 28 years and has 4 children, 1 daughter and 3 sons.

Their children are grown up and independent, each with their own family.  They began their business activities selling everyday items with financial support from their children.  Ater her husband retired, they wanted to be able to continue with their own business to cover the costs for the public services they received from the city.  The small shop is busy every day and they begin work early in the morning and continue until late at night, due to the constant presence of their neighbors.  To satisfy the demands of their customers, they need to expand the stock of items they offer.  For that, they need a loan of $400 which they will repay in 6 months.   Manuela's efforts serve the public, and give an example that for work, there is no \"right\" age.   Let's make  it possible for them to realize their objectives with our support. <\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\nLa se\u00f1ora Manuela  vive sola en compa\u00f1\u00eda de su querido  esposo, a pesar de la avanzada edad de ambos contin\u00faan trabajando por vocaci\u00f3n y deseos de servir al pr\u00f3jimo. Sus hijos son mayores e independientes y cada uno cuenta con su familia. Iniciaron sus actividades con el comercio de art\u00edculos  de primera necesidad con el apoyo econ\u00f3mico que le brindaron sus hijos despu\u00e9s que su esposo se jubil\u00f3 para que pudieran tener una actividad en la que puedan continuar trabajando por cuenta propia y con el objetivo de costearse los gastos por los servicios p\u00fablicos que reciben en la ciudad. La bodega  la tiene ocupada todo el d\u00eda y empieza sus labores muy temprano y las culmina muy entrada la noche; debido a la concurrida presencia de sus vecinos. Con el objetivo de satisfacer las demandas de sus clientes  necesita aumentar el stock de art\u00edculos  para satisfacerlos plenamente. Para ello necesita el apoyo econ\u00f3mico en calidad de pr\u00e9stamo por el importe de   400 d\u00f3lares que los devolver\u00e1 en un plazo de seis meses. Siendo los deseos de Manuela servir a la colectividad dando el ejemplo que para el trabajo no hay edad.

He was fortunate that the agrarian syndicate endowed him with 12 hectares, where he lives and works raising corn, yucca, rice, and peanuts. All their harvest is sold in the market in El Torno. The money he is asking for is to buy a motorcycle so that he will be able to travel the long distances that he needs to. Buying this mode of transportation will help a lot.

He is 61 years old. Alfonso is married and has 3 adult children. To make a living, Alfonso owns & operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising crops. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from planting & harvesting rice for sale. Alfonso has been engaged in his business for over 30 years and earns approximately 5,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Alfonso joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Alfonso has successfully repaid a previous loan of 15,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to to purchase fertilizers such as manure. Alfonso is requesting a new loan of 15,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional seeds, seedlings & young crops to raise. This will be the 5th loan taken out by Alfonso from PMPC. He plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of his family. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She earns her living by operating three business ventures: general store, buying and selling chicken, and dried fish.  Her husband, Lopito C., who is 60 years old, works as a driver\/mechanic to earn his living and helps in his wife's business activities.  They have eight children who are between 19 and 36 years old. Norie joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2002 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 17 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Norie has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 21,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 9000, improving the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 18th loan, she is borrowing PHP 22,000, which she intends to use as additional working capital to save up for the future for her business operations. Norie C. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She has 3 children, of which the oldest is already independent; the two younger ones are still students.  Clara has a grocery store, but started to give them out on credit that she was later unable to collect, so she had to close shop.  Today, she sells food which consists of a dish of tallarin, ceviche and potato with huanca\u00edna style cream.  She sells this door to door.  With the first loan of 300 soles, which she has returned in 4 installments, she bought products for her store which she no longer owns.

By way of this work, he succeeds in supporting his family, providing his little boy with the studies he deserves.

Ural hopes that he will be given a loan and that way he will succeed in his business and improve his living.  \r\n<P>\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International<P>\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and with its famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

They manage various activities: selling plastic materials, coal from wood, and sounbala (an ingredient for sauce). \r\n<p>They count on buying sixty 100 kg sacs of n\u00e9r\u00e9 nuts to prepare the sounbala, seventy sacs of coal, and fifty packages of plastic materials. They sell their goods at the large market (the Grand March\u00e9)  in the city of Sikasso and in the surrounding villages. The merchandise is sold at the Sikasso Grand March\u00e9 on the spot to a clientele composed of men and women, either in cash or with credit. They hope to come to a point when each can earn an average monthly profit of 20 000FCFA, of which a part will be used for the education and health of their children and the other part to be invested in their activities and the reimbursement of the loan. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Laura Buhler, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":875,"image":{"id":314264,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"Purchase various supplies.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sikasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.316667 -5.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:18Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":875,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Afou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Anchata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Djialia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Djata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Djarata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-04-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":425000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":875,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":106250},{"due_date":"2009-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":106250},{"due_date":"2009-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":106250},{"due_date":"2009-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":106250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":218.75},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":218.75},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":218.75},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":218.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":656.25,"local_amount":318750,"processed_date":"2009-07-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T19:22:32Z","rounded_local_amount":323934.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63243007},{"amount":218.75,"local_amount":106250,"processed_date":"2009-08-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T22:45:27Z","rounded_local_amount":107978.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73678804}],"funded_date":"2009-07-01T12:29:14Z","paid_date":"2009-09-15T22:45:27Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Laura Buhler","image":164085}},{"id":110480,"name":"Sofia","description":{"languages":["ru","en"],"texts":{"ru":"\n \u041c\u0435\u043b\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0430 \u0421\u043e\u0444\u0438\u044f \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0436\u0438\u0432\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u0432 \u0440\u0430\u0439\u043e\u043d\u0435 \u0412\u0430\u0440\u0437\u043e\u0431. \u0412\u043e\u0437\u0440\u0430\u0441\u0442 58 \u043b\u0435\u0442, \u0432\u0434\u043e\u0432\u0430 . \u041e\u0434\u043d\u0430 \u0432\u043e\u0441\u043f\u0438\u0442\u044b\u0432\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u0442\u0440\u043e\u0438\u0445 \u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0439. \u0420\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u0432 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0443\u043a\u0442\u043e\u0432\u043e\u043c \u043c\u0430\u0433\u0430\u0437\u0438\u043d\u0435. \u0417\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0431\u0438\u0437\u043d\u0435\u0441\u043e\u043c \u0443\u0436\u0435 5 \u043b\u0435\u0442. \u041c\u0430\u0433\u0430\u0437\u0438\u043d \u043f\u0440\u0438\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0438\u0442 \u043e\u043a\u043e\u043b\u043e 500 \u0441\u043e\u043c\u043e\u043d\u0438 \u0432 \u043c\u0435\u0441\u044f\u0446. \u0412 \u0434\u0430\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043c\u043e\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0442 \u0421\u043e\u0444\u0438\u044f \u0440\u0435\u0448\u0438\u043b\u0430 \u0443\u0432\u0435\u043b\u0438\u0447\u0438\u0442\u044c \u0442\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0440\u043e\u043e\u0431\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0442. \u0414\u043b\u044f \u044d\u0442\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043e\u043d\u0430 \u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0438\u043b\u0430\u0441\u044c \u043a \u043d\u0430\u043c \u0437\u0430 \u043a\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0438\u0442\u043e\u043c. \u041d\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u043b\u0443\u0447\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u0434\u0435\u043d\u044c\u0433\u0438 \u043e\u043d\u0430 \u0441\u043c\u043e\u0436\u0435\u0442 \u0437\u0430\u0432\u0435\u0437\u0442\u0438 \u043d\u043e\u0432\u044b\u0439 \u0430\u0441\u0441\u043e\u0440\u0442\u0438\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0442.","en":"Sofia M. lives in the Varzob region.

Crisanta is requesting a new loan of 20,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the second loan taken out by Crisanta from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family and pay the tuition of her children.. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.

Faiziya is married and the loving mother of her child. Her husband is a driver. Faiziya works hard to provide for her family. She started her business with a small amount of capital and in time, expanded her business with the help of Imon International. At the present time, she has her own place at the market and she sells children\u2019s clothes. She has been in this business for 15 years and she would like to get a loan of 3,000$ US to purchase new spring children\u2019s clothes. She thanks all the lenders who support her and allow her to increase her assortment of goods, which will attract more customers. \r\n   \r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

However, thanks to the commitment that he puts into his work sowing, fertilizing and caring for his crops, he manages to sell his harvests in the central market in town, which makes him good profits.  With a lot of hard work and saving, he was able to buy his own farmland which minimized his expenses and enabled him to make extra money and think about increasing the quantity of produce that he grows.

Born in 1977, Mrs. Abla A. has has been making and selling bread for 7 years already. She is married and a mother of three (3) children. Her husband has been unemployed for the last few years also helps with the business. The growing business makes it possible for Mrs. A. to meet the family's needs. The exceptional quality of the bread she sells has brought her many loyal customers. Bread retailers come in great numbers for their own supplies. However, she cannot meet the market needs because she is limited in the production of the bread. She is thus looking to build a new oven and increase the daily production. Unfortunately, her income does not enable her to cover all the expenses of this undertaking. She is thus asking for a loan of $850 to build a second oven. This will, in turn, increase the family income and improve their living conditions.\r\n \r\n<p> <b>Translated from French by Ivana Kostic, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nLe pain est l\u2019une des denr\u00e9es alimentaires les plus consomm\u00e9es au Togo et particuli\u00e8rement \u00e0 An\u00e9ho (Pr\u00e9fecture des Lacs).

Ask Safina, she will tell you. You bake them! <p>\r\n\r\nActually, the first thing you do is find a plot of land where there is an adobe (a natural building material mixed from sand, clay, and straw) quality to the soil. Then you make a wooden mold in which you will wet the earth, making mud and slopping it into the molds. When the mold is dry enough to keep its form, you release the bricks from the mold. You let them dry enough to be stacked. Create a 2ft x 2ft hole at the bottom of the stack . This is where you will build your fire.

She is 45 years old, and her husband is a police agent.  They have three children ages 9, 21 and 23.  Two of her kids are still in school, while the oldest is now working.  Celia has five years of experience running her grocery store, a business she started after losing her previous job at the Managua mayor\u2019s office.  All her capital was invested into the sale, which was good since now she has something of her own for support.  Sales are good, and sometimes the persons who deliver her products let her have the merchandise on credit for the next day but she doesn\u2019t have the capital at this time to pay.  With this business, she can also see to caring for her family.  Her request for this loan is to invest in her enterprise, buying a variety of daily use products to offer to her customers.  Her long-term aim is to make improvements to the family\u2019s home and provide an education for her children. <p>   <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Mary Lynn Malaby, Kiva

C. is 58 years old, partnered, and has three sons (ages 38, 36, and 32) who are all married and self-employed. His partner runs a small restaurant in their home. German's goal is to provide proper maintenance for his truck to give his customers high-quality service. He would also like to upgrade to a larger and more modern vehicle so that his customers are more comfortable. His dream is to have a pool hall, which would generate greater income for his family. As a pool hall is in great demand from young people, he would have a large clientele and he would be able to pass on the business to his sons so they would have adequate support.\r\n<p>\r\nFor forty years, German has offered transportation between the city and rural areas. He began his business in Managua, using his own money. Previously he had sold products such as picture frames, vases, and appliances. That business was difficult to maintain because he often was unable to sell all his merchandise.

Desde su infancia estuvo dedicado a los cultivos agr\u00edcolas, ya que sus padres sembraban numerosas hect\u00e1reas de tub\u00e9rculos como la papa y el olluco en terrenos de la comunidad. En esos terrenos que la comunidad les brindaba, a cambio, ellos retribu\u00edan en los trabajos para la  comunidad. Por ello que cuando form\u00f3 familia lo primero que hizo fue inscribirse como comunero, para que de ese modo pueda seguir haciendo uso de los terrenos de cultivo, ya sean de regad\u00edo o temporales. Macario en todo este tiempo viene sembrando papas y alverjas, asimismo cr\u00eda animales, y hace 2 a\u00f1os puso una bodega en su casa para que su esposa se dedicara a ella. Todos estos negocios, le causan gran satisfacci\u00f3n y complacencia, por ello pese a las dificultades de las plagas que acechan a sus cultivos sigue muy motivado de invertir y trabajar con mucho cari\u00f1o en sus siembras, las cuales por muchos a\u00f1os le han brindado comodidad y bienestar a su hogar. Macario es el presidente de su banco comunal, donde conduce con mucha serenidad los diversos dilemas entre los integrantes. Este es su 7mo pr\u00e9stamo con MFP, y da ejemplo de puntualidad.

Since childhood he has worked in agriculture as his parents sowed tubers such as potatoes and ulluco on many hectares of community land. In areas where the community offered them land, they reciprocated by working for the community. As such, the first thing the family did was to register as commoners with joint tenure of the land so that they could continue cultivating it, whether irrigated or temporary. The whole time, Macario has been planting potatoes and peas, and at the same time rearing animals. Two years ago he put a grocery shop into his house so that his wife could run it. All of these businesses give him great joy and satisfaction so, despite the difficulties of pests threatening his crops, he remains highly motivated and dedicated, sowing his seeds with much care. For many years his crops have provided comfort and wellbeing for his family. Macario is the president of his community bank, where he promotes diplomacy during the various dilemmas amongst the members. This is his 7th loan with MFP and he is an example of punctual repayments. The money that he is asking for now is to buy insecticides to control the pests on his potato and broad bean crops.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Lara Francis, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":304967,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy insecticides","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-04-19T11:50:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":650,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Macario","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-03-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":650}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":650,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2010-01-18T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:10:28Z","rounded_local_amount":2018.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118123955}],"funded_date":"2009-04-19T13:53:17Z","paid_date":"2010-02-15T12:10:28Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lara Francis","image":null}},{"id":106400,"name":"Eric","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Eric O. is a 46-year-old married man and father of three children, one of whom is a boy.

She lives in a house she owns along with her husband Humberto, 40, and their two children, Edson, 18, and Yesica, 15, who are the motive for all her efforts. Although she knows that being an auto mechanic is hard work, she does not shy away and works arduously to make headway for her business, which has provided the necessary income to support her family. With a lot of effort, Nelida has given her auto repair shop a good name in her area, and as a result it gets a lot of business. What she likes most about her job is working with cars and helping fix them, something she has been doing for six years. The thing she considers the most difficult is loading the heavy parts needed to make the repairs. In the future, she hopes to expand the size of her workshop so she can be able to serve more customers at a time. This is Nelida's first loan with Kiva partner MFP, and she knows that she has to make all her payments on time and is prepared to do so. She is a very responsible member of her community bank and is always active in the meetings. With the loan of 1,000 soles she is requesting, she plans to purchase more auto parts with the hope of providing a better service for her customers' cars.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Marty Greenstein, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":468996,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Auto Repair","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"Purchase car parts","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Juliaca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15.5 -70.133333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-01-14T01:50:12Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nelida","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-12-14T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2010-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2010-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2010-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2010-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2010-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":165}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2010-01-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:10:24Z","rounded_local_amount":169.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118124434},{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2010-02-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:48:57Z","rounded_local_amount":169.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123960175},{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2010-03-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:32:51Z","rounded_local_amount":169.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128993019},{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2010-04-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:37:22Z","rounded_local_amount":169.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136717805},{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2010-05-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:39:26Z","rounded_local_amount":169.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144751480},{"amount":57.75,"local_amount":165,"processed_date":"2010-06-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:02:38Z","rounded_local_amount":167.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151933947}],"funded_date":"2010-01-14T10:03:36Z","paid_date":"2010-07-15T10:02:38Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Marty Greenstein","image":null}},{"id":172259,"name":"Consorcia's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Consorcia G.'s main source of income comes from making and selling general household furniture to local businesses and community members.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling a variety of different products in the local community. Litas has been engaged in her business for over 5 years and earns approximately 8,000 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Litas joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.

Litas is requesting a new loan of 14,900 PHP which will be used to purchase new items to expand her store's product offering. This loan will be the 4th loan taken out by Litas from PMPC.

Dalaguete in Cebu Province. She earns her living by operating two businesses: fishing and a food vending business. Her husband, Eduardo P., who is 30 years old, works as a bill collector to earn his living. They have two children; one child is 8 months old and the other is 8 years old.\r\n<p>\r\nRosemarie joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2005, because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 11 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Rosemarie has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 19,000 PHP helped her earn a monthly profit of 12,000 PHP, raising her family's standard of living. This time, for her twelfth loan, she is borrowing 17,000 PHP to add to her working capital in order for her to continue saving for the future education of her children and the acquisition of assets. Rosemarie P. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.\r\n<p>\r\nAbout NWTF: <br>\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than 1 USD a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She earns her living by operating 2 business ventures:  Sari-sari (general) store and ready to wear - direct selling business. Her husband Jonathan C., who is 41 years old, works as carpenter for a living.  They have 3 children, ages 11 to 18. <p>\r\n\r\nJerima joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2005 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 10 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Jerima has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 14000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 34000, improving the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 11th loan, she is borrowing PHP 20000, with which she intends to purchase more stock to sell, so she can continue to save for house renovations in future. <p>\r\n\r\nJerima C. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. About NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.
