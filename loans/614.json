Her husband is in the business of fattening and selling cattle.  Hadicha would like to take out a loan towards the purchase of several rams for her husband.  She explains that her husband would never have come to MicroInvest, so she took it upon herself to assist him with this. Since the price of cattle in the marketplace is currently low, she would like to increase her husband's herd. In her free time, Hadicha helps her husband to feed the cattle.  She lives in the remote village of Kashka in the Garfurov region.

Therefore, Mary is bracing herself for this season by purchasing the latest designs of female outfits like dresses, skirts, blouses and trousers. \r\n\r\nMary is happily married with 3 children between the ages of 8 and 0.7. Two of them go to primary school. Her husband sells electrical goods. One of her greatest dreams is to independently import her own stock of clothes from overseas and sell them on a wholesale basis. This will enable her to comfortably support her husband in seeing their children through school.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":233071,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"To purchasing the latest designs of female outfits like dresses, skirts, blouses and trousers.

They live in a small rural community in Costa Rica called \u201cLas Delicias de Upala,\u201d  located in the province of Alajuela.   This is where they develop their economic activities like commerce, raising cattle (for both meat and milk), and farming basic crops like rice, beans and corn.  For the past 8 years Luis has worked raising cattle for meat and for milk.  He sells his products to his neighbors, who are very satisfied with the quality of his products.  In his particular case, the demand for his products is greater than what he can currently offer.  Luis believes that, thanks to the progress of this project, he and his family have improved their living conditions.  They have also become active in developing their community, which is frecuently affected by unemployment and bad weather conditions.  Today Luis is hoping to receive a loan for \u00a2570,000 colones, which he will repay over 24 months.  He will use the loan to buy 3 more cows in order to increase his production.  He knows that having more animals means more sacrifice and more work, but his desire to be a successful small-business owner and help his family move forward motivates him to keep working with great strength.  Luis is a member of the Community Credit Bank \u201cDatraban,\u201d  one of the 100 member organizations of EDESA in Costa Rica.

Four years ago she started her own business, and with the help of some money her husband saved, she was able to buy the sewing machine she needed to open her business. Shahnozakhon specializes in \r\nwomen's national dresses. Her workshop is in her home and she works Monday through Sunday from 8:00 am until 7:00 pm. She would like to take out a loan of $600 USD for the term of 10 months to be able to purchase new, modern fabrics for her business.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <p>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

A. is 53 years of age, married to Ana Mar\u00eda Araya and the father of two children.  He lives in a rural community in Costa Rica called Mollejones de Platanares, in the Canton of P\u00e9rez Zeled\u00f3n.  Mollejones is a community located 150 kilometers (94 miles) south of San Jos\u00e9 Province, the capital of Costa Rica. It is 850 meters (2,800 feet) above sea level.  They grow vegetables and coffee here and are also developing other activities such as raising and fattening pigs.  There are also projects involving organic farming and hydroponics.  In addition to agriculture, the community has mechanical workshops, a supermarket, some small restaurants (coffee bars) and a furniture-making shop.  Don Reinaldo works at farming, particularly growing coffee with which he has 25 years experience.  He says that during that time he has had some periods when he has done well, and others when he has had to cope with problems such as low crop prices or natural occurrences that damaged his crops.  Nevertheless, he feels that the coffee market, one way or another, is always good and so the necessity of this loan which he will use to renovate an area which will be used for growing coffee and thus ensure that the yield will be optimal and the coffee of excellent quality.  This will be the factor which determines the success of the project.  Presently Don Reinaldo is requesting a microcredit loan of 500,000 Colons to purchase fertilizer and build seed beds in order to plant a hectare (2.5 acres) of coffee as described above.  With this he hopes to improve his family's finances and to provide better opportunities for his children, especially the son who is currently in secondary school.  Don Reinaldo is a member of the Empresa de Cr\u00e9dito Communal Bank, one of a hundred member organizations of EDESA in Costa Rica.  This will be his second loan and he hopes to continue growing as a small businessman.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Daniel Kvaka, Kiva

She is 27 years old, she is single and she lives in a rented room, together with her only son, Alberth, who is 3 years old. She wants so much to improve her life and to be a success. Her business is selling children's clothing including jumpsuits, pants, jackets etc. in the San Jose market (the market is a large market in the city of Juliaca). She offers good deals that are accessible to everyone, and since she likes sales, she always sells out her merchandise. The hardest part of her work is to bring the clothing for sale to her stand - it is very physically taxing and other transportation is very expensive. Candy has been running this business for the past 7 years and she hopes to increase her stocks of clothing. She knows this is the only way she will be able to improve her finances and therefore provide her son with an education.

She has 4 children and has her own home.  She is a very loving wife and mother and also treats her crops with a lot of care.  She knows that with dedication and attention, they will give her favorable results.  She gets up very early every day to make breakfast for her children and husband, who comes home to eat breakfast after working very early in the fields.  Around 9 a.m., they both go out to the fields.  Maria tells us that every day she thanks God for her fields because with his blessing, the land will be very fertile.  She feels very proud of being a farmer because she employs all of the techniques that she has learned over the years.  She sells her products (coffee and bananas) at the markets in Lima, where according to the variation in prices, she can sell them for 6 PEN per kilo.  She is earning better profits, which let her visualize a better future.  This is her third loan with Microfinanzas Prisma.  During her previous loans, she has been very responsible with her payments.  In the same way, she promises to be responsible this time.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Edilberto lives with his wife and two daughters. Like many member of the Los Chiles community, Edilberto is a farmer. He dedicates his time to the planting and harvesting of various subsistence crops including chili peppers. Edilberto is always busy. He organizes his day so that in the morning he wakes up early, eats breakfast and then tends to his chickens. At night, when he has finished working in the fields, he puts in a few more hours at the corner store, which is a part of his house. \r\n\r\nThis loan will be used to finance the production of Habanero chili peppers.  Specifically, Edilberto will use this money to purchase seeds, fertilizer, tools, pesticides, and other materials\/ingredients necessary to the production of chili peppers. All labor and transportation tasks will be carried out by Edilberto and his family. Edilberto dedicates part of his time as a hired hand on a nearby farm. He worries about the coming harvesting season and hopes that he will be successful this year.  Edilberto\u00b4s goal is to maintain stability in his family, achieve higher production rates, improve his economic situation and offer a better standard of living to his family. A major difficulty and limitation for Edilberto has been his lack of working capital. He hopes to use this loan effectively to improve life on the farm for everyone.\r\n\r\nPiper and Capiscum Processors Compa\u00f1\u00eda Agr\u00edcola Industrial, or, PROPICA is an international buyer and seller of chili pepper and ground pepper products.

PROPICA acts as a guaranteed client for small agricultural producers in the area of Los Chiles, thus ensuring that their products will reach market. The collaboration of Fundaci\u00f3n Mujer and PROPICA, represents a unique opportunity to Edilberto, his family and community. By offering a source of start-up capital and a guaranteed client to purchase what is produced, this is a chance to improve family and community standards of living. Above all, Edilberto wants to take advantage of the current opportunity that has been presented. He wants to profit from this collaboration and see improvements in his neighborhood. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1175,"image":{"id":573606,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To purchase seeds and nutrients for the production of chili peppers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CR","country":"Costa Rica","town":"Los Chiles","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"10 -84","type":"point"}},"partner_id":151,"posted_date":"2010-07-23T21:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1175,"lender_count":41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Edilberto","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"CRC","disbursal_amount":600000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":1175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":95914.87},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":97513.45},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":99138.67},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100790.99},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102470.84},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104171.18}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":187.83},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":190.97},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":194.14},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":197.39},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":200.67},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":204}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":174.19,"local_amount":88946.9,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-19T07:47:11Z","rounded_local_amount":89708.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":222221629},{"amount":1000.81,"local_amount":511053.1,"processed_date":"2012-11-01T06:59:59Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-16T10:26:44Z","rounded_local_amount":515426.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315614319}],"funded_date":"2010-07-25T04:00:52Z","paid_date":"2012-11-16T10:26:44Z","journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":221628,"name":"Mario Ivan","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Mario de 45 a\u00f1os, vive en la Perimetral de Guayaquil (zona periurbana, rodeada de un estero salado) el tiene una peque\u00f1a tienda en la parte delantera de su casa. \n\nMario comenz\u00f3 vendiendo arroz, bebidas y otros v\u00edveres para poder mantener a sus dos hijos y esposa que le ayuda en el negocio.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n<p>\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She earns a living selling pigs.  She has a small stable where she raises them and when they've been fattened, she sells them at a local livestock market.  Jazmina gets up every morning, very early, to feed her animals.  She feeds them 3 times a day in order to get the best price for them because well-fed pigs fetch more money.  For the future, Jazmina is thinking of selling more pigs, a plan that will require her to expand the stable where she raises them.  This is her first MFP loan and she's very glad to be able to help herself and to be considered for membership in her community bank.  The money that she's applying for will be used to buy siding, bags of cement, bricks and framing to improve her stable.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jere Wiseman, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":304277,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Improve pig pen for livestock business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"HUANCAYO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.066667 -75.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-04-17T22:30:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jazmina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-03-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":325}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":325,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:56:41Z","rounded_local_amount":1012.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103842102}],"funded_date":"2009-04-18T00:40:46Z","paid_date":"2009-12-15T13:56:41Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jere Wiseman","image":30736}},{"id":106076,"name":"Juana","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Juana es socia del Banco Comunal Desarrollo.\nJuana es casada, tiene 29 a\u00f1os y 3 hijos, Juana junto a su esposo fabrican ladrillos de manera artesanal, para lo cual cuentan con un horno a le\u00f1a, sus ventas los realiza en el mismo lugar.\nJuana necesita un pr\u00e9stamo de 1200 soles dinero que ser\u00e1 invertido en la compra de tierra.\nLos sue\u00f1os de Juana son mejorar su negocio y construir el segundo piso de su casa.\n","en":"Juana is a member of the Desarrollo (\"Development\") Community Bank.

Hog fattening is raising piglets for three to four months. After those months, the pigs have grown and they will be sold. Profit from this kind of business is double the amount of its capital. Piglets bought for Php 1,500 to Php 2,000 can be sold to Php 4,000 to Php 6,000 after four months. Norma started by raising two piglets. After that, the loans she accessed from ASHI were used for growing her later business. Profits she made from the hog fattening were re-invested in her variety store business. <P>\r\n\r\nSomeday, Norma hopes to have bigger pig pen to raise many pigs for a bigger profit. Her ambition of growing her business and having more profits is because of her desire to have savings for her unemployed husband and herself in case of emergency, for she doesn't like her children to be financially bothered about them. She and her husband have been living alone together for many years since their children have had their own families.

She is 32 years old. Cecelia is the group leader of a ten-member group loan offered by ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nCecelia is married and has four school-aged children. To make a living, she owns and operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising pigs for fattening and sale. She is just starting this business.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Cecelia joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase livestock feed and other supplies.\r\n\r\nCecelia is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP which again will be used to purchase livestock feed and other supplies. This will be her 7th loan from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated to improve her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful micro-finance institutions in the Philippines. It has 38 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

She lives with her spouse and their two-year-old son.  They live together in her parents\u2019 house with her parents and her grandparents.  \r\n\r\nIda\u2019s work consists in selling fish.  She goes out early in the morning to look for fresh fish in the city\u2019s Bellavista market.  From there she takes the products to her spouse\u2019s father\u2019s house, a place with lots of passersby.  She sets up a table there to sell this seafood and waits for customers to come by looking for fresh fish.  She\u2019s been doing this work for a year and to date has been doing it alone because her spouse works in another department of Per\u00fa; he sends her a bit of economic help.\r\n\r\nWhat she likes about her work is that it leaves her with time to be at home doing other things during the afternoon and also because every day she earns good income because her work produces good profits.  She hopes to be able to support herself and perhaps later on open a grocery store at home.\r\n\r\nThis will be her second MFP loan.  She did well with the previous one and was responsible with her payments.  She is very grateful for the opportunity she\u2019s being given to increase working capital because that will lead to higher profits.  She will use the requested 1000 soles to buy fresh fish as well as a few trays and materials to be able to sell her fish more comfortably.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":907568,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish Selling","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy more fish and trays.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-10-30T20:10:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ida ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":144.12},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":159.34},{"due_date":"2012-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":158.56},{"due_date":"2012-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":172.69},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":179.92},{"due_date":"2012-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":185.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.05},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.75},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.46},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.76},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.47},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.51}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":54.05,"local_amount":144.12,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:42:53Z","rounded_local_amount":146.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244621886},{"amount":59.75,"local_amount":159.34,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:51:19Z","rounded_local_amount":161.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250835961},{"amount":59.46,"local_amount":158.56,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:17:55Z","rounded_local_amount":160.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257245719},{"amount":64.76,"local_amount":172.69,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:31:52Z","rounded_local_amount":175.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263385755},{"amount":67.47,"local_amount":179.92,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:29:25Z","rounded_local_amount":182.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270098849},{"amount":69.51,"local_amount":185.37,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T10:31:32Z","rounded_local_amount":187.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276712976}],"funded_date":"2011-10-30T21:52:08Z","paid_date":"2012-05-15T10:31:32Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":356912,"name":"Madina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Madina lives in Kampala, Uganda.

He is a married man and lives with his wife and 3 children, aged between 9 and 16 years, in the municipality of Soledad where he has a restaurant. He sells meals, set meals and fast food among the other delights of Caribbean cuisine. He started out as an entrpreneur selling fish which he brought from Sucre, a municipality he used to live in before, to sell at the public market in the city of Barranquilla where he sold it at his brother-in-law's stall. Gradually he built up a large clientele and for this reason decided to move to Soledad, where he bought a plot of land and built his own house, looking for a way to not have to travel so much and pay more attention to his family. There, together with his wife, he started making meals and this is what he currently does and with which he has managed to take care of his family. Currently he is applying for his first loan with the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo with which he will buy ingredients to make his food in larger quantities. He will also repair his industrial oven, looking to get it in excellent condition for the end of year, a season of  great commercial activity in the food sector as families celebrate and buy ready made food instead of making it themselves. His main customers are his neighbours and a few people who work in companies and usually come to savour the delicious sancochos (traditional, regional type of stew), prepared at the small rneighbourhood restaurant of Ciudadela Metropolitana and which are now well known. His investment will be successful because he will receive discounts for bulk purchase buying and cash payments and because it will increase his working capital and earn him a bit more than usual.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":939930,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Restaurant","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy ingredients to make his food in larger quantities and also repair his industrial oven.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Soledad Atl\u00e0ntico","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2011-12-11T14:00:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":525,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Cristo  ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-12-06T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":73173},{"due_date":"2012-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":74880},{"due_date":"2012-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":76627},{"due_date":"2012-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":78415},{"due_date":"2012-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":80245},{"due_date":"2012-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":82117},{"due_date":"2012-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":84033},{"due_date":"2012-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":85994},{"due_date":"2012-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":88001},{"due_date":"2012-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":90054},{"due_date":"2012-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":92155},{"due_date":"2012-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":94306}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.42},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.31},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.23},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.16},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.13},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.11},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.12},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.15},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.2},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.28},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.38},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.51}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":38.42,"local_amount":73173,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T10:21:13Z","rounded_local_amount":74027.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257188780},{"amount":39.31,"local_amount":74880,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:35:18Z","rounded_local_amount":75754.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263324985},{"amount":40.23,"local_amount":76627,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T09:30:03Z","rounded_local_amount":77521.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270039046},{"amount":126.41,"local_amount":240777,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:36:26Z","rounded_local_amount":243588.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294338319},{"amount":89.26,"local_amount":170027,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:03:42Z","rounded_local_amount":172012.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301394902},{"amount":46.2,"local_amount":88001,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-18T08:24:53Z","rounded_local_amount":89028.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308774738},{"amount":47.28,"local_amount":90054,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T13:18:06Z","rounded_local_amount":91105.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315386728},{"amount":97.89,"local_amount":186461,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T13:51:45Z","rounded_local_amount":188637.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322993624}],"funded_date":"2012-01-13T17:11:06Z","paid_date":"2012-12-15T13:51:45Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Maria Blyth","image":null}},{"id":373300,"name":"Adnan","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Adnan is a 30-year-old young man, and he is a father to two sons and two daughters.

Most of them live in monogamous families in Lafiabougou - one of the urban districts of Sikasso (the third largest administrative region of Mali). They are seeking their second loan with the Soro Yiriwaso microfinance institution, in order to satisfy their customers' demand. The previous loan was fully repaid. AWA - standing second on the left in the photo - is a spice trader in the BENKADI group of women. With this loan, she intends to purchase: 2 baskets of cauliflower, 1 basket of tomatoes, 1 bag of onions, 1 bag of kitchen salt, 1 basket of fish (dried and smoked), half a basket of pepper, 1 bag of okra ('gombo') and 1 box of Maggi cubes. She buys her supplies from wholesalers in the Grand March\u00e9 in Sikasso town. \r\nShe retails them from a fixed stall at the market, and through her family connections, to a customer base made up of men and women - for cash.

She is currently helping her son in polishing the furniture. Her husband is a construction worker and her other child is a blue-collar worker. The family\u2019s income, as a result, has become much more stable. Mrs. Hoa is very interested in borrowing loan and paying it back in a certain period of time because it has helped her better manage the family\u2019s finances. She and other members in her group have fully paid back the loans in the first round. In the next round of loan, other members in her group include:\r\nMr. Nguyen Van Tai, aged 46, would like to borrow 5.152.000 VND to make and sell rice.\r\nMrs. Nguyen Thi M., aged 50, would like to borrow 4.704.000 VND to raise poultry.\r\nMrs. Man Thi Luyen, aged 29, would like to borrow 4.704.000 VND to make and serve breakfasts for customers. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Vietnamese

Cuando aument\u00f3 el volumen de clientes, hizo cr\u00e9ditos a prestamistas de la calle, para diversificar el negocio ofreciendo  refrescos, fritos y mekatos, esta financiaci\u00f3n le resultaba onerosa y  muchas personas en su barrio, le hablaron de la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, fue entonces que inici\u00f3 su relaci\u00f3n con esta entidad, y con su primer cr\u00e9dito reemplaz\u00f3 los pasivos costosos. Actualmente se encuentra tramitando un segundo cr\u00e9dito, el cual va a usar para surtir con refrescos dulces y productos derivados de la harina de trigo sus estantes y va a mejorar la infraestructura su negocio con una cubierta, porque en invierno se moja y no tiene tiempo de recoger sus  muebles y enseres.  Sus principales clientes son los operarios de los talleres industriales que funcionan en este sector comercial que es altamente concurrido.\n\nFernando todos los d\u00edas agradece a Dios  por el amor de la familia y el apoyo de  instituciones y de todas las personas que han cre\u00eddo en \u00e9l.

He is originally from Polonuevo-Regencia, a community in the department of Bolivar. He finished high school with support from his parents. He is grateful to his parents and 5 siblings for the material and emotional support they provided him after he suffered polio when he was 4 years old. He was left with difficulties that prevent him from moving very quickly. He now has his own family with his wife and three children.\n\nFernando is an enthusiastic and optimistic man. He started a business selling sweets and cigarettes with money lent to him by his sister and it has grown, little by little. When he increased his number of customers, he took loans from street lenders to diversify his business of selling soft drinks, fried foods, and sweet breads. This type of financing turned out to be onerous and many people from his neighborhood told him about Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, and that was when he began his association with this institution. With his first loan he repaid his previous, expensive loans. He is now requesting a second loan to purchase soft drinks, sweets, bread products, shelving, and he will improve the infrastructure of his business by putting a covering over it, because during the rainy season things get wet and he doesn\u2019t have time to put away his furniture and other belongings. Most of his customers are workers in the industrial workshops that fill this busy commercial area of town.\n\nFernando thanks God every day for the love of his family and the support of the institutions and all of the people who have believed in him. For the future, he hopes to continue being the pillar of strength for his household and, along with his wife, to provide a good example for his 3 children and to give them an education. \n<br

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from these services. Miguel has been engaged in his business for over two years and earns approximately 5000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Miguel joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Miguel has successfully repaid a previous loan of 15,000 PHP from GDMPC. Miguel is requesting a new loan of 15,000 PHP which will be used to repair existing vehicle for better service. This will be the tenth loan taken out by Miguel from GDMPC. He plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of his family. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.
