She is 38 years old and is a resident of Tanza, Cavite City, Philippines. Her husband is Benjamin, a security guard.  Aiden is a mother of three children, two are studying in elementary school while one is still staying at home. She, together with her children, manages their own household while operating her business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nAiden operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, PHP5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns profit by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and  people in the local community. She earns a minimum of Php 350 in sales every day.  Aside from this, Aiden also sews rugs for added income. \r\n\r\nTo help continue the operations of her business, Aiden is requesting a loan of Php 10,000. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, beverages and other products needed in her business. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nAiden hopes to be able to expand soon and dreams of being able to give her children a good and high quality education through all her hard work in her business.

He works as a solar lamp distributor in Mali.\n\nPrior to becoming a distributor for NOTS, Daniel studied agriculture and engineering and worked as a farm manager at a Malian textile company.   Upon learning about the work of NOTS Mali, he was very motivated to become a distributor because he knew solar lamps would be a great benefit to people living in the rural areas where he lived and worked.  \n\nDaniel sells solar lamps directly to farmers and through small retailers and individual entrepreneurs in Sikasso, the southern-most region in Mali.   Most people living in this area work in agriculture and about 80% of the population does not have access to electricity.  They rely, instead, on kerosene, flashlights and candles for light and they must walk long distances and pay to charge their mobile phones.  On top of being harmful to the environment, time-consuming, and damaging to users health (inhaling kerosene fumes is like smoking 2 packs of cigarettes a day), these energy sources are expensive, costing a family about $110 per year - $80 for kerosene and $30 to charge a mobile phone.   \n\nA solar lamp that provides up to 16 hours of light, can charge a mobile phone and has a lifetime of about 5 years costs just $35.  Purchasing a solar lamp is a win-win - families benefit because they save time, money and they are safer and healthier and the environment benefits from less toxic waste and reduced CO2 emissions caused by kerosene use.  \n\nThe funds from Kiva investors will allow Daniel to purchase 570 solar lamps and sell them to cotton and sesame farmers on credit.  These lamps will impact almost 4,000 lives.  Harvest season starts in September, so it is a good time for Daniel to sell lamps as the farmers will have some money to pay for the lamps.  It is difficult, however, for them to pay in one lump-sum payment, so Daniel will collect payments in installments.  This way farmers can access solar light without so much financial strain on their household.\n"}},"status":"deleted","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1432179,"template_id":1},"video":{"id":2881,"youtubeId":"YpzycAZDKJ4","title":"Kiva Borrower Daniel from Mali","thumbnailImageId":1432179},"activity":"Goods Distribution","sector":"Wholesale","themes":["Green","Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy solar lamps that he will sell to cotton and sesame farmers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sikasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.316667 -5.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":332,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":20050,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Daniel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-12-15T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":9828160,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":20050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":9828160}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20050}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Janessa Karawan","image":1204200}},{"id":751688,"name":"Soeurng's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Soeurng,40, is a local famer residing in Battambang province.

The main source of income for the business comes from selling baked goods in the local community. Lotu has been engaged in this business for more than six years and earns approximately 250 WST a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2006, Lotu joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Lotu has successfully repaid a previous loan of 2250 WST from SPBD. This previous loan was used to purchase raw ingredients needed to make products for sale. Lotu is now requesting a new loan of 1000 WST, which will also be used to purchase raw ingredients needed to make products for sale. This will be the fifth loan taken out by the borrower from SPBD.  Lotu plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business  to improve\/expand his business.\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\n\r\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self-esteem.\r\n\r\nNote: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

She is 32 years old. Letecia is separated from her spouse and has two young children. To make a living, Letecia owns and operates a business making and selling food. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling snacks and other delicacies in the local community. Letecia has been engaged in her business for more than two years and earns approximately 3,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Letecia joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Letecia is requesting a loan of 5,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase raw ingredients needed to make products for sale. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Letecia from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement the income of the family. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

C. lives and does business in Baclaran - a commercial district between the cities of Paranaque and Pasay City.  She is 55 years old and lives with her two children.\r\n<p> \r\nLeticia owns and manages a bakery which is open to customers twenty-four hours a day (24\/7).  She also has a general store where she sells banana cue and coconuts.  She opened her bakery a few years ago with only an assistant working at the oven.  Now her bakery employs nine bakers who rotate as store attendants as well.  She earns at least P30,000 a day from the combined operations of the bakery and the general store. \r\n<p>\r\nShe has just finished repaying her previous loan with the Center for Community Transformation (CCT) Credit Cooperative.  The easy-to-pay and low-interest loans provided by the cooperative allow her to purchase bakery supplies and store merchandise in bulk amounts, saving her a lot of time and money.  She has currently applied for a new loan in the amount of P48,000 to use as additional capital for her businesses.  \r\n<p>\r\nLeticia believes that education would be the best gift she could give her children, so she works hard to better improve her businesses.  She finds fulfillment in that from her profits and savings, she is able to send her children to reputable schools.  \r\n<p>\r\nAbout CCT\r\n<p>\r\nThe Center for Community Transformation (CCT) is an organized Christian response against poverty and social injustice.  This is carried out through the fusion of social development initiatives and evangelical mission in a uniquely Filipino context.  It serves urban and rural poor communities throughout the Philippines, in pursuit of its desire to see changed lives, strong families, and transformed communities centered in the Lordship of Jesus Christ.  \r\n<p>\r\nCCT is a member of the Five Talents family.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1025,"image":{"id":433842,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bakery","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To

She is starting a business venture, selling pancakes (fried flour pancakes flavored with lemon or coconut jam).  Petimani needs a loan of WST $1000 to buy flour, flavoring, sugar, and plastic bags.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 195 tala or US $81 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Petimani joined SPBD.    This is her 1st loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Petimani's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Petimani E. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.89 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.66 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2.1 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/www.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

She's the mother of two school-attending children. The couple lives with their children. Zinatou and her husband support the family expenses together.\r\n\r\nTo help with the family expenses, Zinatou's main business consists in selling corn and rice, as well as soaps.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She has a 19 year old son who attends university and her dream is to see him complete his studies and succeed in his career.\r\n\r\nAna has been working with \" Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo\" since 2002.  She knows when it's the best time to request loans because she is well aware of how much she earns and how much she should save.  She began her relationship in order to increase her inventory of articles of clothing, and be able to deliver within her neighborhood and at a furniture store, where she is currently employed.\r\n\r\nShe is requesting this loan in order to be able to make improvements to her bathroom and repair the walls around her patio to improve the security of her home.  She was able to make other improvements with the money from her past loans and her goal is to continue making improvements until her home is adequate.  She is asking for a loan of 1,200,000 COP ($625).\r\n\r\nAna lives in a commercialized zone, located in the southwest of the city, very near religious communities dedicated to community development and supported by international organizations.  They have helped improve her neighborhood and made it possible for many other people to study, start businesses, and improve their family relations; in other words, improving lives.\r\n<br

Together they have four children and live in the regional center of Orhei.  Ruslan has been worried for some time about not being able to provide for his family and realized the only way to make a sustainable future for his family was to start his own business.  Ruslan comes from an agricultural background yet he has no land to start a farm.  After studying different possibilities he has decided to start growing mushrooms.  Growing mushrooms requires very little land and the initial investment is reasonable which makes it an ideal micro business startup for any entrepreneur.

N.

She also makes and sells tortillas, the major staple in the everyday diet of the people of Guatemala. Guatemalans don't prefer the machine-made type but rather the ones that are made by hand by patting freshly milled corn dough and cooking them to perfection on a hot metal plate. She makes about 65 tortillas a day and sells them for about US$0.12 for 6 hand-made tortillas. Making the tortillas has been challenging for her lately because several months ago she fell at a circus and badly broke her arm and lost almost all movement of her hand. The break is evident from the 6 inch scar on her upper arm. Making tortillas can sometimes be very painful. But on the worst days she is happy to be working with a partner who helps her get through the day. <p>Ana is single and lives with her mom and her 5 other brothers and sisters.

Mariya is 50 years old and comes from a large and humble family. She is a widow and has two children. Her father's hard and demanding character showed her, from the time she was young, the significant value of work and therefore she has been successful in various activities throughout her life. Now Mariya dedicates herself to raising and selling cows. The income she generates provides a better quality of life for her family. She is asking for a loan of $1200 US in order to buy calves to later sell when they are fully grown. With this investment, Mariya will be able to substantially increase her earnings and improve her quality of life. \r\n<p>\r\nLet\u2019s support this dedicated mother's proposal. \r\n<p>\r\n<b>More about Tajikistan and IMON International:<\/b>\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its epic mountain passes and its rich history which includes its place as a key post along the Silk Road and events at the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has produced famous thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. A civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged an already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural productivity and the manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent viable business prospects. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He learned about Hluvuku through the head of his neighborhood.  This is his second loan.

She is very grateful to everyone who made this loan possible so that she can continue working.  Laxmi says her Communal Bank is one of the most organized groups.  In addition, all the members are punctual when submitting their payments.  She plans to invest the money she requested in the purchase of a large quantity of spare parts so that she can restock her business and offer better service to her customers.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":525741,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Spare Parts","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Purchase spare parts to increase her inventory","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Chanchamayo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.05 -75.316667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-04-19T22:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":725,"lender_count":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Laxmi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-04-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":725}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":725,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T08:52:22Z","rounded_local_amount":2054.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195886332}],"funded_date":"2010-04-20T16:09:22Z","paid_date":"2011-03-24T08:52:22Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ronan Reodica","image":498323}},{"id":197909,"name":"John","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"A determined and hardworking K.

Donakhon is 29 years old. She is married with three children. For 12 years, Donakhon has worked as a market vendor. She is selling the plates and dishes of the oriental style in the central local market. This kind of goods is of popular demand among the population. This kind of china is widely used for the dowry of the girls and also for the family celebrations. \r\n\r\nThe love for her children is the biggest reason for Donakhon to make an effort to provide what they need. Now Donakhon is planning to enlarge the range of goods. With this purpose, she requests 10,000 Somoni. \r\n\r\nDonakhon has been an active and strongly motivated client of IMON since 2006. Her credit history makes her eligible to receive new and larger loans. Donakhon and her children are sincerely grateful for your support. \r\n\r\n<b>More about Tajikistan and IMON International<\/b>\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a being key post along the Silk Road, and for the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

In addition to his business, he builds houses as a mason.  He works on construction projects based on when his services are required.

Today, BRAC has emerged as an independent, virtually self-financed paradigm in sustainable human development. It is one of the largest Southern development organizations employing over 100,000 people, 61% of which are women, and working with the twin objectives of poverty alleviation and empowerment of the poor. Diagnosing poverty in human terms and recognizing its multifaceted nature, BRAC approaches poverty alleviation with a holistic approach.\r\n<br><br>The successes of BRAC in the international development arena have stimulated a series of discussions, both with African delegations, who have visited BRAC programs, and with donors who work in Asia and Africa. Both the African countries and the donors have encouraged BRAC to join the development campaign in Africa to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and more recently to join the campaign of \u201cending poverty\u201d, which is an area where Africa represents the greatest global challenge.\r\n<br><br> In Uganda, BRAC registered as a Non Government Organization (NGO) in January 2006 to undertake programs in Education, Health, Water & Sanitation, Agriculture & Livestock and Microfinance. The Microfinance and Education are the pioneer programs launched in Uganda and, as of July 2007, had served 21,273 borrowers and enrolled 1,155 adolescents in its education

The organization is devoted to the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through microfinance as a practical way to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets; thus, they are deemed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and hence poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.

Most of its members are new, and live in the same neighborhood. They are very enthusiastic to work hard and take advantage of the opportunity offered to them in this loan cycle. There are about 5 returning group members who are taking out new loans. Some group members sell cosmetic products (Yanbal, Esika and Avon brands), one is a laundress, and others sell drinks and\/or food (lunch or dinner). There is a lot of competition in these fields, since every day more and more people are taking up informal commerce, but each group member makes a notable effort to pay off each loan installment on time. The group members will invest their loans in a variety of different things: those who sell cosmetics will use the money to fill their personal orders; one client will buy plastic tables and chairs for her small restaurant, and most of the remaining clients will invest the money in their respective businesses and jobs in order increase revenue. The returning group members have previous experience at other similar financial institutions, while others are taking out a group loan for the first time. Returning clients have been invited back due to their demonstrated commitment to paying off their loan installments on time and complying with Fundaci\u00f3n Agrocapital's standards.\n<br

His son is completely dependent upon Miguel.  They live together in Apopa.  \r\n\r\nHe is a very responsible man who works as a builder.  He has been doing this work for 30 years.  That makes him a complete expert at repairing different things.  Miguel very much wishes to get ahead and offer his family everything they need.\r\n\r\nThat is why he is requesting a loan from Integral.

BRAC and BRAC Uganda<\/b><br><br>\r\nBRAC (Building Resources Across Communities) is a development organization that began operations in Bangladesh as a small-scale relief and rehabilitation project in 1972 to help the country overcome the devastation and trauma of the liberation war and focused on resettling refugees returning from India. Today, BRAC has emerged as an independent, virtually self-financed paradigm in sustainable human development. It is one of the largest Southern development organizations employing over 100,000 people, 61% of which are women, and working with the twin objectives of poverty alleviation and empowerment of the poor. Diagnosing poverty in human terms and recognizing its multifaceted nature, BRAC approaches poverty alleviation with a holistic approach.\r\n<br><br>The successes of BRAC in the international development arena have stimulated a series of discussions, both with African delegations, who have visited BRAC programs, and with donors who work in Asia and Africa. Both the African countries and the donors have encouraged BRAC to join the development campaign in Africa to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and more recently to join the campaign of \u201cending poverty\u201d, which is an area where Africa represents the greatest global challenge.\r\n<br><br> In Uganda, BRAC registered as a Non Government Organization (NGO) in January 2006 to undertake programs in Education, Health, Water & Sanitation, Agriculture & Livestock and Microfinance. The Microfinance and Education are the pioneer programs launched in Uganda and, as of July 2007, had served 21,273 borrowers and enrolled 1,155 adolescents in its education program."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1800,"image":{"id":102340,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Products

Sofia has used profits from her colmado (small corner store) to build this house, a significant achievement and proof of an expanding business. El Puerto is not an easy place to live: few medical facilities, large distances to nearest towns, little access to electricity, and no potable water access can cripple a population. Despite these difficulties, Sofia and her group have found stability in their loans and look forward to continuing to develop their businesses and community.\r\n\r\nSofia will be using this loan, her ninth with Esperanza International, to buy additional merchandise for her store, including bread, juices and soft drinks. She said that before having loans, it was easy for her and other group members to fail in their businesses because they did not have enough cash flow.

Janeth has been engaged in her business for over ten years and earns approximately 5,000 PHP a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Janeth joined Kiva partner HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Janeth has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional products to sell. Janeth is requesting a new loan of 8,000 PHP which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This loan will be the second loan taken out by Janeth from HSPFI.

This made it possible for Burmabubu to build a house and contribute to the marriage of her daughters. With the loan, she will buy calves to increase the number of their cattle. In the future, Burmabubu plans to save money and contribute to her sons' weddings.\r\n\r\nDamira B. is 59 and is married. She has three sons and three daughters.

First and foremost, it means sacrificing nighttime sleep, doing without respite hours and not having enough time for family. That was the exact experience M. Dan went through before he called it quits and started his five-year-old business selling chapati (unleavened flatbread, similar to tortillas) in Amber Court Market in Jinja.\r\n\r\nFor this single 24-year-old, it was time to cast his mind to the future. Dan knew he had to extricate himself out of this problem. His decision to take up this business was based partly on the fascination Ugandans have with chapati rolled egg omelets and the fact that he needed to find a stable and more convincing livelihood. \r\n\r\nFor the last five years, Dan has shown resilience in stemming the tide of financial and other challenges to his fledgling business that have cropped up. His hard work has been paying dividends as he has been making profits close to 30,000 shillings a week. With his determination the future looks promising.\r\n\r\nDan is planning on expanding his business through the purchase of more bags of chapati baking flour with the assistance of this loan.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1500,"image":{"id":550987,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To purchase more bags of baking flour to make more chapatis","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Jinja","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.583333 33.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":84,"posted_date":"2010-06-09T00:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1500,"lender_count":53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Dan","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Connie","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Christine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Moses","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Benedict","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Noelina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mathius","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sarah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Betty","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Grace","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Susan","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-06-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":3400000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":1500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":212500},{"due_date":"2010-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":212500},{"due_date":"2010-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":212500},{"due_date":"2010-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":212500},{"due_date":"2010-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":212500},{"due_date":"2010-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":212500},{"due_date":"2010-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":212500},{"due_date":"2010-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":212500},{"due_date":"2010-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":212500},{"due_date":"2010-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":212500},{"due_date":"2010-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":212500},{"due_date":"2010-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":212500},{"due_date":"2010-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":212500},{"due_date":"2010-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":212500},{"due_date":"2010-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":212500},{"due_date":"2010-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":212500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.75},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.75},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.75},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.75},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.75},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.75},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.75},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.75},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.75},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.75},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.75},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.75},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.75},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.75},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.75},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":285.42,"local_amount":646950,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-20T07:46:53Z","rounded_local_amount":650755.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":152662541},{"amount":370.83,"local_amount":840550,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:47:07Z","rounded_local_amount":845494.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159689318},{"amount":463.48,"local_amount":1050550,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:48:13Z","rounded_local_amount":1056729.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166903475},{"amount":380.27,"local_amount":861950,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-16T09:15:43Z","rounded_local_amount":867020.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172296950}],"funded_date":"2010-06-15T20:17:37Z","paid_date":"2010-10-16T09:15:43Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jeff Avery","image":233371}},{"id":210230,"name":"Gifty","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Gifty is very welcoming.

With the help of her past four loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Ruffa has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow.

Otherwise, demand normally plummets during planting season when many people consume more of their own green vegetables and less meat.\r\n\r\nWhat has made his business have an advantage during the aforementioned good seasons is the fact that he normally has lots of goats to sell. Through revenue from his side farming business, he is able to purchase more goats to add to what he already has. In this way, he can meet the heavy demands of clients.\r\n\r\nThe fact that Christopher is an optimist and a good planner is not only his winning calling card for now, but also is likely to be in the future.
