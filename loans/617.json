She has been growing potatoes and vegetables for 20 years.\r\n\r\nWhat she likes the most about her work is being able to see how the plants develop.  Selling all of her productions depends upon the growth of her plants.  She usually sells in the market in her city.  As a hard-working woman, she manages her money very well.  \r\n\r\nHer goal is to buy hectares of land in order to be able to plant potatoes and vegetables.  That way she will have stock for the customers she usually has in the capital.  That is where she travels to sell her production.  She is currently employing techniques to increase her sales.  Therefore, she hopes for support from each one of you so that she can carry out her proposal of buying farmland.  That way she will get greater income, which will allow her to provide her children with the quality of life that they deserve.\r\n\r\nShe belongs to the Los \u00c1ngeles de Llanco Communal Bank.  This is her seventh loan with MFP.  She hopes to get a small loan in order to meet her objectives.  She pledges, once again, to make all of her payments as she has done with the previous loans she has had.  It pleases her to be part of her communal bank because all of the members are responsible and very supportive people.  She will use the requested money to buy sacks of organic fertilizer to spread amongst her plants.  That way she will get a good production.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":793095,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Green"],"use":"to buy sacks of organic fertilizer.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-06-20T16:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":450,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nora ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-05-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1200,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":1200}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":450}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":450,"local_amount":1200,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:17:59Z","rounded_local_amount":1242.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257245252}],"funded_date":"2011-06-20T18:23:55Z","paid_date":"2012-02-15T11:17:59Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ginny Kalish"}},{"id":311992,"name":"Salome","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Salome is 32 years old.

Thi Bay, 35 years old, joined the TYM Fund in 2006. Born in the rural area, she understands that she would face financial problems if her family only relied on farming. Right after she was married, she discussed with her husband to find a business that would stablise their family's economy, and they decided on selling pork. Everyday, her husband goes to the town market to buy pork which her sells at home whiL. Mrs. Bay then sells in the village market, bringing back a daily profit of 150,000VND (about 10USD). Since joining the Fund, her family has had more capital so their business has been even more smooth. Besides, she still has a source of income from farming and raising livestock. This time, she would like to borrow 9,000,000VND (550.00USD) to further invest in her business. Her family's average monthly income is 6,000,000VND (about 400USD).\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Vietnamese by Pham Yen Thanh, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\nCh\u1ecb L\u00ea Th\u1ecb B\u1ea3y 35 tu\u1ed5i.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling cooked food in her carenderia and she also had her sari sari store in the local community. Sherlina has been engaged in her business for over 12 years and earns approximately 5000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Sherlina joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Sherlina is requesting a new loan of 5000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the 2nd loan taken out by Sherlina from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand the borrower's business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines.

She always enjoyed working and wanted to start another business.  Now her customers include her friends, relatives, and neighbors.  She goes to their homes to boost her sales by advertising whenever she has new products.  However, she considers her greatest challenges to be the location of her business because it is not visible from the outside, the lack of space, and insufficient capital.  To resolve these issues, her goal is to have a larger store in her main room that provides more space and is more visible from the street.\r\n<p>\r\nMuriel is currently requesting a loan of 2,000,000 COP.  Half of the money will be invested in the purchase of products for her business.  The other half will be used to improve her home by raising the ceiling because it is quite low.  Although this is her second loan, her husband has been associated with the Foundation for several years.  During this season, the two of them plan to acquire more supplies, attract more customers, and continue making more sales.  In addition, they hope to build a kitchen and add another room to their home.  Later on, Muriel dreams of completely remodeling her house and also providing her children with an education so that they can finish both high school and college.

She is 54 years old. Delia is the leader of a 5-member loan group sponsored by ASKI. Although each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are collectively responsible for repaying the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is Delia A. Group.\r\n\r\nDelia is married and has 3 adult children. To make a living, Delia owns and operates a general store where she sells a variety of different products in the local community. Delia has been engaged in her business for over 20 years and earns approximately 4,000 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Delia joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Delia has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Delia is requesting a new loan of 13000 PHP to purchase new items to expand product offering. This loan will be the fifth loan taken out by Delia from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve her family's living conditions.\r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 29 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1350,"image":{"id":527913,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

This time, for her tenth cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 15,000, which she intends to use to purchase raw materials for her food vending business. Her goal is to continue to save up for the future, specifically toward children's education and her family's needs. Anita P. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, the Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon, a Hiligaynon word that means \"honorable.\" Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass their dreams.

His children and wife live with him in his house.  His wife does catalog sales of makeup and shoes.  To help his wife out with the finances and to be a little more free with their expenses, they have their house payments deducted from Juan Hermilo's paycheck.  This is the second time they are seeking a loan with this organization.  They are very honest and hardworking people.

With his previous loan he was able to buy two cows at a time, and he would like to expand his business even further to generate more income. The other group members operate different types of businesses. Saidu has a small local restaurant, Mohamed B. buys and sells cows, and Hassanatu B. and Alphajor B. own small grocery stalls in the market. All would like to expand their businesses. They are requesting loans of approximately $275 US per member. Group members guarantee each other in case of failure to repay the loan by any member, and the group already has some savings and are saving additional money weekly."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1375,"image":{"id":150605,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Conflict Zones"],"use":"Capital for expanding several businesses:  livestock, restaurant, and grocery stalls","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SL","country":"Sierra Leone","town":"Kabala","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"9.583333 -11.55","type":"point"}},"partner_id":57,"posted_date":"2008-04-18T10:20:12Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1375,"lender_count":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ibrahim","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Saidu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mohamed","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hassanatu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alphajor","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-05-02T18:55:18Z","disbursal_currency":"SLL","disbursal_amount":4000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":1375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":400000},{"due_date":"2008-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":400000},{"due_date":"2008-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":400000},{"due_date":"2008-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":400000},{"due_date":"2008-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":400000},{"due_date":"2008-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":400000},{"due_date":"2008-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":400000},{"due_date":"2009-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":400000},{"due_date":"2009-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":400000},{"due_date":"2009-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":400000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2008-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":138,"local_amount":401454.55,"processed_date":"2008-06-02T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:57:14Z","rounded_local_amount":403236,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":225701},{"amount":138,"local_amount":401454.55,"processed_date":"2008-07-02T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:58:42Z","rounded_local_amount":403236,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":255042},{"amount":138,"local_amount":401454.55,"processed_date":"2008-08-02T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T01:00:21Z","rounded_local_amount":403236,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283771},{"amount":138,"local_amount":401454.55,"processed_date":"2008-09-02T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-09-09T02:22:59Z","rounded_local_amount":403236,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":313923},{"amount":138,"local_amount":401454.55,"processed_date":"2008-10-02T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-03T07:13:44Z","rounded_local_amount":403236,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":345269},{"amount":135,"local_amount":392727.25,"processed_date":"2008-11-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T04:04:47Z","rounded_local_amount":394469.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5345792},{"amount":137.5,"local_amount":400000,"processed_date":"2008-12-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T02:48:13Z","rounded_local_amount":401775,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9968352},{"amount":137.5,"local_amount":400000,"processed_date":"2009-01-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:03:01Z","rounded_local_amount":401775,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14884762},{"amount":137.5,"local_amount":400000,"processed_date":"2009-02-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T20:53:32Z","rounded_local_amount":401775,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20434231},{"amount":137.5,"local_amount":400000,"processed_date":"2009-03-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:43:35Z","rounded_local_amount":401775,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27128592}],"funded_date":"2008-04-18T18:55:18Z","paid_date":"2009-04-15T21:43:35Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":48937,"name":"Hagar","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Hagar A. prepares food for sale and also sells plastics and provisions.

A temprana edad quedo hu\u00e9rfana de madre, era la mayor de 4 hermanos por lo que se hizo responsable de ellos, trabajando en la chacra de sus vecinos quienes le pagaban en productos (papa y ma\u00edz) que los compart\u00eda con sus hermanos. En vista de que le faltaba dinero se propuso criar cerdos y luego vend\u00eda la carne a sus vecinos. Al pasar los a\u00f1os, a base de mucho trabajo, compr\u00f3 sus propias tierras agr\u00edcolas, en ellas sembr\u00f3 papas y arvejas, algunas veces le result\u00f3 muy rentable, como tambi\u00e9n tuvo p\u00e9rdidas, pero jam\u00e1s desisti\u00f3 en su trabajo.

Espirita atiende su bodega mientras va conversando con sus clientes y brind\u00e1ndole un buen trato, puesto que valora la preferencia que le tienen, lo que le permite acumular dinero para cubrir la educaci\u00f3n superior de su hijo mayor, con los anhelos de que sea un buen profesional. Mientras tanto, Espirita sigue trabajando hasta terminar de educar a su hija menor a quien tambi\u00e9n ama mucho. Este es su cuarto cr\u00e9dito con MFP, durante los ciclos pasados demostr\u00f3 puntualidad en cada una de sus cuotas. En una oportunidad en que a su hermano le faltaba dinero para cubrir sus cuentas (ambos pertenecen al mismo banco comunal) ella pag\u00f3 la diferencia, lo que muestra que a\u00fan sigue pendiente de sus hermanos menores. El dinero que ahora viene solicitado es para la compra de fertilizantes para sus cultivos y en mayor parte para adquirir cuadernos y papales para su mini librer\u00eda. ","en":"Espirita is 52.  She is a very hard working woman, and she is a single mother.  She lives in her own house with her 18 year old son and her 11 year old daughter.  They are the motivation for her efforts.\r\n\r\nAt an early age she was left as an orphan without a mother.  She was the oldest of four siblings, so she became responsible for them.  She worked on the neighbor\u2019s farm, and they paid her in products (potato and corn), which she shared with her siblings.\r\n\r\nIn light of the fact that she did not have money, she set out to raise pigs.  She later sold the meat to her neighbors.  As the years passed, and after much work, she bought her own fields to cultivate.  She planted potatoes and peas.  Sometimes it was very profitable.  There were also losses.  But, she never stopped worked.  That was how she was able to build her house and set up a store in it.  As of nine months ago, she also has a small bookstore, which her daughter takes care of in her free time.\r\n\r\nEspirita takes care of her store while she chats with her customers.  She treats them well, and she appreciates them.  This allows her to accumulate money to cover her son\u2019s high school expenses.  The goal is for him to be a professional.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Espirita will continue working until she finishes educating her young daughter, who she also loves very much.\r\n\r\nThis is her fourth loan with MFP.  During the past loan cycles she has demonstrated punctuality in all of her payments.  One time her brother did not have the money to cover his accounts (they both belong to the same community bank), and she paid the difference.  This shows that she still watches over her younger siblings.\r\n\r\nThe money that she is now asking for is to buy fertilizers for her crops. The larger part of the money is to buy notebooks and paper for her mini bookstore.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1150,"image":{"id":343813,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bookstore","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Increase merchandise and buy fertilizers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-06-27T15:30:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1150,"lender_count":38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Espirita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-06-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":1150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":3500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1150}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":1150,"local_amount":3500,"processed_date":"2010-04-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:37:20Z","rounded_local_amount":3513.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136717163}],"funded_date":"2009-06-27T18:18:39Z","paid_date":"2010-05-15T11:37:20Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ginny Kalish"}},{"id":122684,"name":"Ephraim Plus Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Henriette B. est vendeuse des haricots, \u00e9pices, et divers devant sa maison dans la partie nordique et la plus peupl\u00e9e de Kinshasa.

He is noted for being a very simple and hard-working father.  He lives in his own home together with his wife, 57 year-old Julia, and his three dependent children who he looks after with a lot of dedication.\r\n\r\nIgnacio's arduous workdays on his farm have helped him to improve his family's economic situation.  He and his wife are responsible for looking after their children's well-being and so they work as hard as they can, growing potatoes, peas, beans, corn and other vegetables.  They then take their produce to sell in the wholesale market in the city of Tarma.\r\n\r\nWhat Ignacio most enjoys about his work is caring for his crops since he knows that healthy produce fetches a better price.  He has been in this business for 12 years and he considers the hardest part of his work to be having to climb the steep hills of Antabamba which is where he has his farmland.\r\n\r\nIgnacio has support from his wife who buys and sells cattle.  She fattens them up and then sells them on for a higher price.  In the future, Ignacio hopes to improve his farm and sow all of his land.\r\n\r\nIgnacio is a member of the \"Los Pinos de Antabamba\" (The Pine Trees of Antabamba) community bank and this is his sixth loan from MFP.  He hopes for a small loan which will enable him to reach his goals.  For his part, he pledges once more to make his repayments on time, as he has done with his previous loans.  Ignacio enjoys being a member of his community bank because all the members are responsible and very supportive people.\r\n\r\nIgnacio will invest the money he has requested in buying a bag of pea seeds, 20 sacks of Yungay potatoes, organic manure and natural fertilizers.

They live in traditional families with their husbands, generally their husbands\u2019 other wives, and their children in Djinina, a village in the Fana subprefecture, Dioila prefecture, Koulikoro Region, Republic of Mali. They all have small businesses that consist of selling food items, clothing, charcoal, fruits and vegetables, etc. They are primarily united by the fact that they live in the same village. Benkadi has been working with Soro Yiriwaso for four years and has obtained eight group loans which were all repaid in full. The group members who sell charcoal generally buy it in other villages and then sell it for cash on market days to business clients from Bamako or S\u00e9gou. The other women buy their condiments in Fana and then sell them retail in the village. With this loan, the women of the Benkadi group from Djinina, Fana hope to each earn a monthly profit of 10,000 CFA francs, which will be mostly used to pay off the interest on the loan and resolve some financial problems.

When the seeds are ready to be planted, the rows must be tilled, then the seeds must be planted and buried. Then you must wait until they germintate, then once the plants get buds, you fumigate them until the flowers are mature. The most gratifying part for her is the price she is able to sell them for in the months of May and October, when the holidays of Mother's Day and the Day of the Dead occur, respectively, when a bouquet can be sold for 80 soles. When these seasons have passed, the price goes down to half of that, but the loss does not matter as long as she can be in the land--she could take or leave the mature flowers for the process of just growing the seeds. \r\n\r\nThe seeds cost a lot and are sold for about 150 soles for a sack, but the benefit is being able to grwo gladiolas. Haydee is new to the lender, MFP, and she and others have formed a new comunnal bank with the commitment of paying all of the payments back by the time indicated and according to the instructions of the loan consultant. The money that she asks for will buy 10 sacks of fertilizer for her flower farm, with the point of reference that a sack will cost 95 soles and with which she will have more than enough to also prevent flies.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Misty McNally, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":261605,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy fertilizer and insecticide","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-01-27T01:20:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Haydee","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-07T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":325}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":325,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2009-07-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:39:46Z","rounded_local_amount":1035.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63210860}],"funded_date":"2009-01-27T02:36:25Z","paid_date":"2009-08-15T16:39:46Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Misty McNally","image":77472}},{"id":89932,"name":"Maria Cristina","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Maria Cristina inici\u00f3 el negocio  por la necesidad de tener un ingreso que le permitiera salir adelante y de ser una mujer independiente, sin miedo a los retos y trascender como persona y como madre, realizando lo que le gusta que son las ventas y obteniendo un ingreso para sostener a sus hijas ya que quedo viuda.

Because of the demand for Internet access, she decided 2 years ago to start a business providing public Internet booths.  For this, she outfitted some space that her in-laws provided inside their home.  Soledad tends to her business each and every day in order to generate the necessary income for the household, renting her computers out on an hourly basis.  Her business has been fruitful so far, as it is the only such service in her area.  This motivates her to continue to progress and upgrade her machines so she can offer a better and faster service.  This is her first loan with MFP, and her first experience in a cooperative bank.  Regardless, Soledad has a great desire to work in a team environment with all of her colleagues.

She has always characterized herself as being a very charismatic and cordial woman, which is the secret to her business. She is dedicated to selling wallets, purses, caps, and other accessories in the market of the district of Puente Piedra in the city of Lima.\r\n<p>\r\nHer job gives her lots of pleasure, because she can make recommendations to her clients about what goes well with them, and it keeps her busy through the long day. Although she has four years experience in this work, which makes her able to do her job, we cannot say that it is easy, because she dedicates practically her whole day to it. Karina works from eight in the morning until nine at night on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, since on Tuesdays and Thursdays she does her job at a market closer to her home.\r\n<p>\r\nIn the future she would like to have her own clothing store exclusively for kids, because she loves kids a lot. Furthermore, she thinks that this market will be more profitable, because there is more variety in colors and designs and she wouldn't have competition because there are no stores in her area dedicated to this market. This is her first individual loan with Microfinanzas PRISMA, having previous experience in community banks, but due to lack of time to attend group meetings, she has opted for this choice. With the money that she is requesting, she will buy more novel wallets and purses to increase her sales and come closer to realizing her dreams.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jay

Tiene 12 nietos: 10 ni\u00f1os y 2 ni\u00f1as. Ella tiene varios negocios peque\u00f1os: trabaja como costurera, vende queso, y compra y vende ropa y art\u00edculos para el hogar (baldes, tinas, s\u00e1banas, etc.). Trabaja en Jipijapa y tambi\u00e9n en Guayaquil; es costurera para una f\u00e1brica de pl\u00e1sticos industriales en Guayaquil, y confecciona ropa para mu\u00f1ecas. Tiene la facilidad de hacer el trabajo de d\u00f3nde quiera, entonces por lo general trabaja desde su casa en Jipijapa, donde tiene varias m\u00e1quinas de coser y viaja a Guayaquil para entregar los trabajos. Ya lleva 18 a\u00f1os trabajando en eso, y dice que le encanta la costura. Tambi\u00e9n hace trabajos para particulares, m\u00e1s que nada ternos y vestidos para mujeres. Las ventas de queso hace de la siguiente forma: compra unos 50-70 libras de queso a la vez a $1.30 la libra, despu\u00e9s lo divide en paquetes de 1 libra y lo revende a $1.80. \n\nEst\u00e1 pidiendo un cr\u00e9dito  para comprar m\u00e1s mercader\u00eda, sobre todo art\u00edculos para el hogar, como s\u00e1banas por docenas.

Nunca ha tenido problemas serios para pagar sus deudas; a veces se ha atrasado un poco pero siempre paga el 100% de su pr\u00e9stamo al fin del ciclo. \n","en":"Nancy is 52 years old, she is married, and has 5 adult children who have their own families. She has 12 grandchildren: 10 boys and 2 girls. She has several small businesses: she works as a seamstress, sells cheese, and buys and sells clothing and household items (buckets, washtubs, sheets, etc.). She works in Jipijapa and also in Guayaquil; she works as a seamstress for a plastics factory in Guayaquil and makes clothes for dolls. She can do the work wherever she likes, so she generally works from her house in Jipijapa, where she has several sewing machines. She travels to Guayaquil to deliver her work. She has been doing this for 18 years and she says she loves to sew. She also does work by request, mostly suits and dresses for women. She sells cheese in the following way: she buys around 50 to 70 pounds of cheese at once, at $1.30 per pound, and then divides it into one-pound packages which she re-sells at $1.80. \r\n\r\nShe is requesting a loan to buy more merchandise, especially household items such as sheets by the dozen. She sells her merchandise on credit. Her goal for the future is buy a piece of land in Guayaquil and build a house so she can live there.\r\n\r\nNancy is a member of the \u201cNuevos Horizontes\u201d (New Horizons) communal bank, which meets every 2 weeks in Jipijapa, Manab\u00ed, near the Ecuadorian coast. It is a big group because it has been working with the foundation for a long time. The members get along together very well. Nancy has been with the communal bank for three loan cycles; she had been a member previously, and she decided to participate again because someone stole one of her sewing machines and she wanted to buy another one. She is glad she came back to the communal bank and she plans to remain a member for a long time. She has never had serious problems in repaying her debts; a few times she has gotten a little behind, but she always pays 100% of her loan by the end of the loan cycle. \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jennifer Day, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":363518,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Products Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"For the purchase of more merchandise, especially household items, such as sheets by the dozen.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Jipijapa","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1050,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":" Nancy Narcisa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-07-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1045,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":1050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":130.63},{"due_date":"2009-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":130.63},{"due_date":"2009-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":130.63},{"due_date":"2009-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":130.63},{"due_date":"2009-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":130.63},{"due_date":"2009-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":130.63},{"due_date":"2009-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":130.63},{"due_date":"2009-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":130.59}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131.26},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131.25},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131.26},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":131.25},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":131.26},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":131.25},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":131.26},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":131.21}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":262.51,"local_amount":261.26,"processed_date":"2009-09-08T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T17:41:45Z","rounded_local_amount":262.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87035137},{"amount":131.26,"local_amount":130.63,"processed_date":"2009-09-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T17:42:55Z","rounded_local_amount":131.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87035138},{"amount":131.25,"local_amount":130.63,"processed_date":"2009-10-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T21:24:12Z","rounded_local_amount":131.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96947393},{"amount":131.26,"local_amount":130.63,"processed_date":"2009-10-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T21:30:50Z","rounded_local_amount":131.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96947394},{"amount":131.25,"local_amount":130.63,"processed_date":"2009-11-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T12:29:40Z","rounded_local_amount":131.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103789240},{"amount":131.26,"local_amount":130.63,"processed_date":"2009-11-17T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T12:30:05Z","rounded_local_amount":131.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103789241},{"amount":131.21,"local_amount":130.59,"processed_date":"2009-11-26T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T12:30:50Z","rounded_local_amount":131.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103789242}],"funded_date":"2009-09-03T07:13:56Z","paid_date":"2009-12-15T12:30:50Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jennifer Day","image":null}},{"id":130908,"name":"Mwinda Plus Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Mbeli I. 60 ans, est dirigeante d\u2019un groupe d\u00e9nomm\u00e9 \u00ab Mwinda Plus \u00bb qui veut dire \u00ab Light \u00bb en anglais, qui est compos\u00e9 de 27 membres micro-entrepreneurs tous unis solidairement pour recevoir des pr\u00eats de Kiva dans le but de d\u00e9velopper leurs activit\u00e9s.\nMbeli est vendeuse des boissons et des courges devant sa maison dans la partie du sud-ouest de la ville de Kinshasa.

Balut sells every night, as it\u2019s a huge Filipino favorite. Francisca profits nicely in her balut business, a great help in augmenting her rice and dried fish income.\r\n<p>\r\nBefore her children entered college, Francisca sustained her enterprises through loans available through ASHI with all profits going to her children\u2019s support. Now, however, with the greater expenses of college, Francisca must work harder to increase her profits, especially since she is widowed and with no other source of income. She has determined that once her children have finished their studies, she will save her income for both family emergencies and her businesses. \r\n<p>\r\nFor now, she is requesting from ASHI a loan

She is 38 years old, has eight children, and her husband is a security guard.  Her eldest son is 17 years old, the youngest is three, and all but the youngest are in school.  She has been running her business for 17 years.  She began with about $100 that she received from her husband.  She sells sugar, Omo soap, rice, etc.  She displays her merchandise in the central market of Virunga.  This loan will allow her to increase her turnover by purchasing ten bags of rice, five bags of Omo soap, etc.  The biggest challenge is that she sells in the national currency (Congolese francs).  Because this Congolese currency is not stable, she is subjected to more and more inflation, which leads to a loss in exchange with foreign currency (dollars).  She is like many Congolese who fear the Congolese franc and instead keep their savings in dollars.  She would like to buy a small plot of land on which to build for her children.  As a client, Mauwa M. thanks Hekima for its actions to help the poor citizens who are excluded from traditional banks.

Despite her young age, she managed to run the business for several years now. She found out about the loan from Kiva and was happy to tell her fellows about it. Odinakhon is single and lives with her parents, brother and a sister-in-law. Her mother is actively involved in agriculture, her father is a construction worker and her sister-in-law is a kindergarten teacher. Odinakhon says she inherited a strong and persistent personality from her mother. At the age of 17 she already knew best techniques for cultivating land and ways to get a rich harvest. At this moment Odinakhon is preparing the small piece of land that her family owns for sowing. She really hopes on good weather this year, because last year\u2019s long winters and late spring destroyed most of her cultivation. The outcomes led to a poor harvest in fall, which raised only small amount of funds. She\u2019s learned her lesson, and this year she will try to be more careful and follow the weather predictions. The history of the land goes far back to a period of fall of the Soviet Union back in 1991. During privatization, the family was given this land, which has become a major source of income for the entire family. This year she plans to sow seeds of cotton. Therefore she gathered her fellows and applied for this loan. \r\n\r\n       --- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance (MBF), a young, ambitious and socially-focused Microfinance Institution in Kyrgyzstan. \r\nMBF is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development and upholds the triple bottom line \u2013 People (building human capital and taking care of its customers as well as society), Planet (keeping environmentally friendly) and Profit (earning revenue to expand autonomously).

Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 500 PHP in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operation of her business, she is requesting an 8,000 PHP loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, beverages and other products to expand her inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nYolanda hopes to grow her business and give her child a good and high quality education through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

is 47 years old and originally from Mozambique's capital city, Maputo. Alfredo is married with 3 children, who all live and study in Xai-Xai, in the Gaza Province. On top of supporting his wife and children, Alfredo helps his mother, in-laws and also a few other members of the family.\r\n<p>\r\nAlfredo completed secondary school and has been a teacher since 1985. He currently teaches at the Instituto Pedagogico of Boane daily from 7:00am to 10:30pm and earns a monthly salary of MTn 5,000. His salary will be increased by 11% next month due to the government's annual salary adjustment. Alfredo is an endless learner and dreams of attaining a master degree one day. He is currently in his second year at the University of Maputo, pursuing a Biology degree. Alfredo studies from 12:30pm to 5:20pm daily and takes a public transport of 40min to Maputo (30Km away from Boane). Alfredo explained that the university fees are dependent on the person\u2019s capacity to pay and profession. With Alfredo\u2019s base salary and teacher\u2019s diploma he pays only MTn 100 per subject at university. This semester Alfredo is taking 5 different subjects. \r\n<p>\r\nAs the government provides housing for teachers, Alfredo has always lived in the school at which he teaches. He has been living at the Instituto for more than 10 years now. Alfredo\u2019s dream is to build his own house and provide comfort for his family. He is almost there. With this first loan of MTn 18,500 Alfredo will buy aluminum-roofing, cement to finish the floor and install some missing windows. Alfredo estimates that one or two more loans will be necessary to finish the house and move in. He heard about Hluvuku during a conversation with some colleagues who advised him to approach the institution after hearing him complain about the slow progress of his house\u2019s construction.\r\n<p>\r\nIn the future Alfredo would like to build a small henhouse in his backyard where he will be able to raise chickens and have a steady business, already planning for retirement when the day comes."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":161526,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Construction","sector":"Construction","themes":null,"use":"Buy

village, about three miles from Magburaka town, in northern Sierra Leone. MCA Primary school is the only school in Massegbeh village. The school was established in 2004 by the Missionary Church of Africa. Currently, it has ten staff and a total of 182 pupils. \r\n\r\nThese teachers, like many of their counterparts in Magburaka and other parts of the country, have applied for a loan from SMT\/Kiva in order to invest in something meaningful. And gradually, out of their monthly salaries, their school bursar repays SMT on a monthly basis on behalf of the teachers.\r\n\r\nAs teachers\u2019 salaries are usually small in Sierra Leone, needless to say that SMT\/Kiva loans are of a great importance to these teachers. Some of them will use this loan to either purchase a piece of land in order to build a house, or complete a house building project they have started. Some will use theirs to buy pieces of furniture, like a bed, chairs etc.  Some will use theirs to pay school fees either for themselves pursue further studies or for their children. While others will use theirs to invest in businesses in order to supplement their meager monthly salaries.\r\n\r\nAbdul K. (back row second from left) is the head master at the school. Abdul is 47 years of age. He was born in Yoni village, about 40 miles from Massesebeh village. He is married to a businesswoman and they have four children. One of their children is in Senior Secondary School III (SSS III), the other in Junior Secondary School III (JSS III), one in class six and the other in class one.

This group has ten members. They are beginning their first loan cycle.  They have a lot of hope to grow their businesses since an institution that has confidence in their capacity and their desire to expand and move forward backs them. The majority of the members sell products such as clothes, fish, vegetables, breakfast, potatoes and prepared food. For example, the president sells fruit. She is in her stall in the Bolivar Market most of her time. Some of the time she is also caring for her children in her stall, as she doesn\u2019t have anyone else to care for them. She hopes to proviD. her children with a good education so that they can have a good future. It is because of this that Mrs. Carolina works so hard each day. She has to support her young ones and maintain her home. In the competitive sense, she would like to mention that the members ought to have good quality products to offer to their customers. For this reason they are asking for a loan to increase their working capital and increase their inventory with competitive products. Other members would like to invest in the repair of their stalls in order to give their customers a more comfortable experience. These members sell breakfast. The remaining members want to offer a greater variety of products in order to increase their earnings. Because of the competition, many members have had to stop selling certain products. With effort and dedication the members know how to move forward and bring the bread home each day to their families.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Esther Levandoski, Kiva

Marylou is requesting a new loan of 11000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional inventory & working capital. This will be the 3rd loan taken out by Marylou from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

He is married and lives with his youngest son, daughter in law and granddaughter.\r\n\r\nSarsembai was born in 1953 in a simple family of a farmer with many children (five sons). His father was doing agriculture and animal husbandry and his mother was a homemaker. After finishing the tenth grade Sarsembai enrolled in college to become a driver of trucks and tractors. After finishing his studies he got a job in his hometown's collective farm as a driver. In 1973 being twenty years of age Sarsembai went to serve in the army and continued working in the collective farm after he returned. In 1977 Sarsembai got married and a year later his daughter was born. At first Sarsembai and his wife and daughter lived with his parents and brothers. But some time later the collective farm where he worked had provided him with a plot of land in his home village for building a house where in time Sarsembai has built his home and all the necessary annexes. In 1980 his second daughter was born and five years later his son was born and then another daughter two years after that. His family was growing and Sarsembai continued working as a driver as well as breeding cattle and doing agriculture. In 2006 Sarsembai was able to save some money and buy a truck ZIL which he uses to transport agriculture products and in free time provide services to his neighbors by transporting freights. Additionally he annually rents out about ten hectares of land where he grows sugar beets, barley and clover.

They all live in the city of Villarrica.\r\nIn the photo, Jorge is on the left side of the second row.  He is standing and wearing a white t-shirt.  He makes his living selling second-hand men's women's and children's clothing.  For the last two years he has worked out of this garage.  He sells his merchandise three days a week, on Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays.  During the rest of the week, he repairs furniture, sells handbags and is preparing to start a new business chopping firewood.  Because Villarica is a tourist area, which is favorable, Jorge rents his house to toursits during the two months of the summer season (January and February).  He makes more money from the rental than from his businesses.  With this loan, Jorge will purchase second-hand household linens in the city of Santiago, specifically sheets and curtains.\r\nJorge worked for 20 years in commerce, running a distribution company.  Regretably, his business went bankrupt.  Nevertheless, in spite of that bad experience, his dream is to once again have a confections distribution company, which would afford him job stability.  Consequently, he is motivated to continue with his businesses, since that is the way to obtain the greatest earnings and have a better quality of life.\r\nJorge lives with his wife and his 22 year-old daughter.\r\nHe is very grateful to Fondo Esperanza.  He really enjoys participating in the meetings, especially because he is the president of the communal bank and the leader of the entrepreneurs, who he supports and advises.\r\nWith regard to the financing he is receiving from Fondo Esperanza, it will be a great support to his business.

Her greatest struggle is working to provide her seven-year-old daughter Tatiana with a bright future; Tatiana is severely handicapped and was born with paralysis. Alexandra lives with her children, her 55-year-old mother Elva, and her 30-year-old husband Richard. \r\n\r\nAlexandra lives and works in the Santo Domingo canton of Santo Domingo de los Ts\u00e1chilas. Santo Domingo de los Ts\u00e1chilas is one of the largest cities in Ecuador, with 500,000 inhabitants, but you'd never guess the size of the city from its tranquil pace of life and easy-going inhabitants. Santo Domingo de los Ts\u00e1chilas is in a tropical, humid area of Ecuador, renowned for its natural beauty, its huge markets, and its trade in livestock--the largest in the country.\r\n\r\nThis is Alexandra's first Kiva loan. She will use it to buy more chickens and feed. Alexandra works eight hours a day, with help from her mother Elva, and she uses her spare time to sell other products.\r\n\r\nHer dream is to own her own home, and for one day to see her daughter walk. She hopes her Kiva loan will help her increase her income, so she can gain access to more expensive medical treatments for her daughter."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1175,"image":{"id":840217,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy chickens and feed.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Santo Domingo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":190,"posted_date":"2011-08-09T15:00:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1175,"lender_count":35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alexandra","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-07-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1162.04,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":1175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":80.81},{"due_date":"2011-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":89.59},{"due_date":"2011-11-05T07:00:00Z","amount":90.65},{"due_date":"2011-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":92.97},{"due_date":"2012-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":94.2},{"due_date":"2012-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":96.03},{"due_date":"2012-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":98.66},{"due_date":"2012-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":99.8},{"due_date":"2012-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":102},{"due_date":"2012-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":103.71},{"due_date":"2012-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":105.85},{"due_date":"2012-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":107.77}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.71},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":90.59},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.66},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":94.01},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":95.25},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.1},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":99.76},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100.91},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":103.14},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.87},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":107.03},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":108.97}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":81.71,"local_amount":80.81,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:01:52Z","rounded_local_amount":81.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232797132},{"amount":90.59,"local_amount":89.59,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:13:31Z","rounded_local_amount":90.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238608238},{"amount":91.66,"local_amount":90.65,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-21T08:52:52Z","rounded_local_amount":91.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244562580},{"amount":94.01,"local_amount":92.97,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:02:47Z","rounded_local_amount":94.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250773670},{"amount":95.25,"local_amount":94.2,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T10:15:59Z","rounded_local_amount":95.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257182217},{"amount":196.86,"local_amount":194.69,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:28:32Z","rounded_local_amount":196.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263316871},{"amount":100.91,"local_amount":99.8,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:34:43Z","rounded_local_amount":100.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276645016},{"amount":103.14,"local_amount":102,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T15:29:48Z","rounded_local_amount":103.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283134274},{"amount":104.87,"local_amount":103.71,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:03:22Z","rounded_local_amount":104.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287092630},{"amount":107.03,"local_amount":105.85,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:32:08Z","rounded_local_amount":107.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294334429},{"amount":108.97,"local_amount":107.77,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:56:27Z","rounded_local_amount":108.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301390385}],"funded_date":"2011-08-09T18:56:39Z","paid_date":"2012-09-15T09:56:27Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":328453,"name":"Elizabeth","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Elizabeth is 47 years old and lives in Blancia Molave Zamboanga del Sur.

The loan amounts have gone from 50,000 francs CFA for the first loan to 100,000 francs for the fourth loan.  All the preceding loans have been correctly repaid.  The current loan will be used to buy sacks of grain (fonio, beans, pearl millet, corn, etc.) in different markets in surrounding villages from producers and sometimes locally in T\u00e9n\u00e9.\r\n\r\nThey sell these products to merchants from big cities, such as San, Koutiala, Bla, S\u00e9gou, and Bamako (capital of Mali), and generally in cash at the retail level and on credit at the wholesale level.  \r\n\r\nDue to the high turnover and sizable profit margins, the women intent to realize an average profit of 100,000 francs CFA per cycle that will serve to cover the loan interest and to cope with typical family expenses. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":223237,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"To buy different goods to resell them ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Koutiala","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2008-11-07T20:40:17Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":775,"lender_count":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Bana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Massitan","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatoumata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hawa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-10-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":400000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2008-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2009-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2009-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2009-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2009-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":66666.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":129.17},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":129.17},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":129.17},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":129.17},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":129.17},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":129.15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":129.17,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2008-11-08T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T02:47:54Z","rounded_local_amount":66720.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5350989},{"amount":129.17,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2008-12-08T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:27:18Z","rounded_local_amount":66720.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9974088},{"amount":129.17,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2009-01-07T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:26:52Z","rounded_local_amount":66720.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14889461},{"amount":129.17,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2009-02-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:12:27Z","rounded_local_amount":66720.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20440254},{"amount":129.17,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2009-03-08T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T22:08:08Z","rounded_local_amount":66720.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27135622},{"amount":129.15,"local_amount":66666.65,"processed_date":"2009-04-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:28:34Z","rounded_local_amount":66720.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36033423}],"funded_date":"2008-11-10T02:44:05Z","paid_date":"2009-05-15T23:28:34Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Daniel Kuey","image":669418}},{"id":77676,"name":"Delia Patricia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Delia forma parte del Banco Comunal \u201cMujeres de Grandes Retos\u201d del distrito y provincia de Huaraz, departamento de Ancash.\n\nTiene 42 a\u00f1os de edad, es casada y tiene 3 hijos.

She is 56 years old. Virginia is married and has 7 adult children. To make a living, Virginia owns & operates a business venture in the agriculture sector, raising crops. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from planting & harvesting rice for sale. Virginia has been engaged in her business for over 10 years and earns approximately 3,000 PHP a month for these activities.<P>\r\n\r\nIn 2000, Virginia joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Virginia has successfully repaid a previous loan of 12,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to to purchase fertilizers such as manure. Virginia is requesting a new loan of 15,000 PHP which will be used to pay for services to increase crop yield. This will be the 12th loan taken out by Virginia from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. <P>\r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:<P>\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao.

She lives in her own house together with her two younger daughters and what she wants most is to improve their quality of life.\r\n<p>\r\nHer business is cultivating potatoes, corn, and peas.  Every day early in the morning, she works on her farms, since she knows that the money that she earns from her crop sales will depend greatly on the quality of her products.  She sells her crops in the city market, where they pay her the best.  What she likes most about her work is harvesting her lands, as she feels that then her months of work pay off.  She has been in this business for 28 years and considers the most difficult part to be spraying her lands, as there is always the danger that the chemicals can make her sick.  In the future, she will plant more on her lands to increase her production.\r\n<p>\r\nThis is Lucia\u2019s ninth loan with MFP and the loan money will help her greatly to progress in her work.
