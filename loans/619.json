H. lives in Yavan. He is 55 years old, is married and has seven children. He has a secondary education. He has his own business \u2013 he raises livestock. He buys young calves, feeds them for 40 to 45 days and then sells them in the same market.  He has a shed where he keeps his calves. He has been in this business for 15 years. Raising livestock is a common business in rural areas. Currently, it is the season to buy calves and Faysilla wants to purchase additional calves, which will increase his turnover and bring additional income. Since he doesn\u2019t have enough money to purchase additional calves, he applied for a loan. He plans to repay his loan within 9 months. \r\n\r\n<p><b>Translated from Russian by Jamilya & Keith Leitich, Kiva Volunteers. <\/b><p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\u0425\u0430\u0441\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432

In fact, if you are a regular lender on kiva.org, you may be tired of reading about kuku. Who or what are \u2018kuku\u2019, you may ask. Kuku is Swahili for chickens, and raising them for sale is popular for a number of reasons. <P>Firstly, they require little start-up capital. You can start with one or two, and either add to them as you go, or wait for them to multiple naturally! Secondly, they require little space, so sometimes you can just let them run around in your garden or compound. Thirdly, while they are growing they produce eggs, which can either be sold to provide a supplementary source of income, or eaten to provide a supplementary source of protein. I\u2019m sure there are hundreds of other reasons  raising kuku is so popular (maybe they are friendlier than other animals? Prettier?), but this is all time and space will allow."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":183613,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To purchase additional chicks and feed.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Dar es Salaam","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-6.8 39.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-07-22T11:00:13Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":275,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Frida","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-08-05T18:14:07Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":300000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2008-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2008-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2008-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2009-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2009-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2009-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2009-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2009-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2009-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":30000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":28,"local_amount":30545.45,"processed_date":"2008-09-05T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-09-20T07:26:29Z","rounded_local_amount":32603.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":317210},{"amount":28,"local_amount":30545.45,"processed_date":"2008-10-05T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-17T07:21:57Z","rounded_local_amount":32603.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":348961},{"amount":26.5,"local_amount":28909.1,"processed_date":"2008-11-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T03:31:23Z","rounded_local_amount":30856.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5347893},{"amount":27.5,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2008-12-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:07:18Z","rounded_local_amount":32021,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9970466},{"amount":27.5,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2009-01-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:12:20Z","rounded_local_amount":32021,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14886683},{"amount":27.5,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2009-02-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:01:37Z","rounded_local_amount":32021,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20435945},{"amount":27.5,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2009-03-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:54:03Z","rounded_local_amount":32021,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130249},{"amount":27.49,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2009-04-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:22:40Z","rounded_local_amount":32021,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027082},{"amount":27.5,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2009-05-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:12:26Z","rounded_local_amount":32021,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613122},{"amount":27.51,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2009-06-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:00:31Z","rounded_local_amount":32020.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010205}],"funded_date":"2008-07-22T18:14:07Z","paid_date":"2009-07-16T00:00:31Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":61757,"name":"Beatriz Del Carmen","description":{"languages":["es"],"texts":{"es":"<p>Beatriz has been making hammocks for 10 years now.

Since their capital for the business is quite small, they do not make much profit. They hope to expand the business as the capital allows.\r\n<p>\r\nEven though they always want to save their small profit to reinvest in their business for expansion, they can\u2019t save any money for later due to the large expense of the family of five. Ganbaatar says, \"It would be like a dream come true if my family could live on land that we own. Hopefully, I will be able to send at least one of my children to a university.\" He requests a loan to buy more second-hand clothes and thus to increase their business capital.\r\n<p>\r\nTsetseghand,

She earns her living by selling the furniture made by her husband, a carpenter, and also by selling fish. Cadiz is a coastal city with a vibrant fishing industry, and many women have small businesses selling dried fish.\r\n<p>\r\nAlicia\u2019s husband Jose Jimmy is a carpenter. They have five children from 13 to 22 years old, three of whom are working and help their parents with their household needs and two of whom are currently in school. All of them help their parents with the business as part of their daily chores.\r\n<p>\r\nAlicia joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2002 in the hope that she would be able to help her husband improve the quality of life of their family. With the help of her loans from NWTF-PD she has been able to earn an average monthly income of PHP 16,000 from her business activities. \r\n<p>\r\nAlicia is a member of good standing. Her previous loan of PHP 16,000 was used to fund the operations of her furniture and fish vending. It had a positive impact on both the business and the family\u2019s living conditions. Now she is taking out her 14th loan, for the amount of PHP 18,000, which she intends to use to buy supplies for her furniture-selling business, and also to maintain operations in her fish vending business. Alicia is working hard to achieve her dreams and aspirations for her family, which are to provide them with a brighter future and a more comfortable life.

He has been in this business for 12 years and he enjoys watching his plantations of bananas, coffee, citrus fruit and other native products grow.  It is difficult having to weed his plantations often.  He doesn't like cutting or pulling weeds because he says that his arms ache from carrying out this work every day.  For this reason, he prefers planting, fertilizing and harvesting.  He puts into practice the techniques that his father taught him.\r\n\r\nIn the future, Juan would like to continue planting more coffee and bananas as these are products that are very much in demand in the market.  He would also like to build his own home and set up a grocery store where his future wife can work.\r\n\r\nJuan is a member of the \"Los Progresistas\" community bank and this is his third loan from MFP.

Furthermore, she carries out work for schools, institutions and municipalities in her area; making tables, chairs, scaffolding, closets, desks, and other things.\r\n\r\nShe has three helpers, who are responsible for finishing off the job. She feels very committed to her work. Her motto for the jobs entrusted to her is \"deliver the work on time.\" That's why she has more customers. However, she doesn't like inhaling the sawdust from the wood, and for this reason, she receives medical treatments in the health clinics from time to time.  \r\n\r\nHer problem is not having enough capital to be able to buy more wood. Therefore, she is turning to MFP for her 15th loan, so that she can buy pieces of  wood that will be of great use to her in continuing to provide services to her community."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":883312,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Carpentry","sector":"Construction","themes":null,"use":"To buy pieces of wood for carpentry.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-10-01T04:50:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1100,"lender_count":28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Irene ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-09-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":3000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1100}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":1100,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:30:19Z","rounded_local_amount":3047,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270098710}],"funded_date":"2011-10-02T02:30:15Z","paid_date":"2012-04-15T10:30:19Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jeff & Sandi Goldie","image":92452}},{"id":345363,"name":"Kampala One Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Paulo, who is in his late 40s, is married and has six children.

Dari penjualan babi penggemukan sejumlah 4 ekor selama 6 bulan diperoleh keuntungan sebesar Rp.300.000,- per bulannya.

Because of the demand, she recently began selling pre-paid electronic load credits for mobile phones.  Business is brisk and she consistently makes more than $365 net income per month.

She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 260 tala or US $108 per week) to make improvements to her house.\n\nIn 2008, Ela joined SPBD.    This is her 2nd loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Ela's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\n\nAbout SPBD\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\n\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

She uses unique recipes taught to her by her mother. This allows her bakery to stand out from other bakeries by its special taste quality. Anargul has worked out strategies of cost cutting and a more efficient production, which makes her bread affordable and allows her to acquire competitive advantage. Anargul thanks her friend, whose advice she followed. \r\n\r\nA monthly income of 4,000 soms allowed her family to purchase an automobile, which helps Anargul\u2019s husband start cab driving. She plans to use the loan as an investment in the business. For the generated profits she would like to build a small grocery store.  \r\n\r\n         --- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance (MBF), a young, ambitious and socially-focused Microfinance Institution in Kyrgyzstan. \r\nMBF is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development and upholds the triple bottom line \u2013 People (building human capital and taking care of its customers as well as society), Planet (keeping environmentally friendly) and Profit (earning revenue to expand autonomously).

This business is the economic means by which she is able to pay her bills and other household expenses. However, she dislikes the physical fatigue, as she has to get up very early in the morning to prepare for the day. Nevertheless, this does not discourage her and she continues with her business. She is currently planning to expand her business and to improve her roof so that she can more comfortably tend to her customers. This will be her tenth loan through Microfinanzas Prisma. She is hoping for your help so that she can cement her plans. She also says that she is comfortable with her communal bank and considers her fellow members to be responsible people.

She moved to the small community of Momjor, just outside of Puerto Plata just several months ago, where she lives alone selling clothing on the streets.  She made the move, leaving behind her two children to live with their grandmother, so that she would be able to find a way to pay for their education.  When asked if she would like them to come and join her here in the Dominican Republic, she quickly responded, \u201cNo\u201d.  While not many complete the education system in Haiti (for lack of funds), it is a far superior education to that of the public schools in the Dominican Republic.  Panilus has left everything she knows to fulfill her dream of putting her children through school in Haiti.  The money from this loan will be used to buy more pants, shirts, and shoes to sell on the streets of Momjor.

In this time he has gained much experience and a love for the land. He began cultivating his land through his own efforts and has gradually gotten ahead in life. He has been growing such crops as wheat, onions and potatoes. Each year he has produced a yield sufficient for both the family to consume and for Kholmamat to sell in the market. \r\n\r\nThe business is his main source of income. While it generates a stable income, it also requires considerable funding. This is especially true because Kholomamat wants to grow the farm. He currently has an orchard and dreams of building a workshop so he can process fruits and vegetables. \r\n\r\nToday he is asking for a loan of 700 Somoni ($225 USD). Kholmamat would like to use this loan to buy supplies for the harvest and to improve production. This will allow him to increase the quality of his yield and his earnings at the time of sale. The loan will be repaid in 6 months. \r\n\r\nKholmamat and his family are counting on your help.

She started this business with the goal of helping her family. She is 42 years old, living in the Villa Reconciliacion neighborhood with four children, two of whom are older and working. Her husband works as a conductor, ** and this is why she wants to build her inventory - because her husband's salary is low and everything is expensive. She has received 11 loans from Kiva partner Afodenic, and with this one she will purchase clothing for children, women, and men, as well as purchase silver pieces, which are selling well. Through this, she hopes to earn more income and attract more customers.\r\n\r\n**Translator's note: The meaning of the word \"conductor\" is slightly vague.

For the last two years, she has had a small booth where she sells a variety of cellphones. Although she does not have a fixed location to sell from, her business generates profits regularly. Graciela works alongside her husband who is in charge of cellphone repairs and of selling replacement parts for the phones. Also, Graciela sells bakery goods to the people who live in her area, a business sideline that she has been working on for 8 months and which is going very well.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New Western culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Mirtha is 31 years old and has two children, ages 12 and 7.  She resides in Maica Centra Parada Seis, which is a canton of the city of Cochabamba that is located twenty minutes away from downtown.  Mirtha lives alone with her children and her sister-in-law.\r\n<p>\r\nShe is a responsible person and a hard worker.  Mirtha is the only daughter of four children.  After her parents divorced, she went to go live with her grandmother since her mother abandoned them and her father already left town.  Mirtha started working as a young girl by helping her grandmother collect milk.  She continues in this same line of work and now has three dairy cows that provide 60 liters per day that she uses to make fresh cheeses that are sold in the market.  The income she earns goes toward her children\u2019s education and the care of her grandmother since she is in delicate health.  Mirtha says she owes so much to her grandmother, so she has to help her live longer.\r\n<p>\r\nMirtha is requesting a loan to buy soybean husks to feed to her cows so that they can produce more milk.  This will allow her to make more cheese, which means she will have more income to help her children with their schooling and enable them to earn a degree in the future.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated

Juan Carlos works making hats.  It is a very difficult job that requires a lot of manual labor, time and effort.  He now lives alone, following a separation from his wife not that long ago.  He is still dealing with the problems of their separation, as it was difficult for him, but he is trying to keep going.  In his workshop he has many products ranging from supplies to finished products.  He learned this trade many years ago as an apprentice until starting his own workshop that was very well-received.  He will use the loan money to buy supplies to make hats, as there are currently a lot of parties and celebrations in his area and he has orders for hats.

Her first loan will be in the amount of 2000 BOB and used for buying wool.  She will also buy coca leaves since her family has a side business selling medicinal leaves (an infusion of coca leaves can be used to cure stomach aches and headaches caused by altitude sickness since the city of El Alto stands at more than 3,500 meters above sea level).  \r\n<p>\r\nWhen asked what she likes most about Pro Mujer, Sra.

She makes her home here in a simple house with her eight children and her long-time partner. She says that her most difficult challenge is to raise and provide for her family. She plans to continue enjoying being with her children.\r\n\r\nMarta is excited to be taking out her 10th loan with Esperanza after having successfully repaid her previous loan and expanded her business. She has had her business for over six years, starting after the first loan she received from Esperanza Internacional. She plans to use this loan to invest in her business by buying pants, shirts, underwear and shoes. She will use the profits to pay for a lot that she acquired.\r\n\r\nThis Esperanza associate began with us because she needed to start up a business; a group was formed in her community and she was invited. Her story is representative of her group and of Esperanza's Haitian and Dominican clients generally (many of whom recently emigrated to the DR from Haiti).

To earn a living, Mrs. Tep sells breakfast to the people living in her commune from small a store behind a pagoda. From this business, she generally earns about $3.50 per day to cover her primary daily expenses. She is very diligent in her work to pursue a comfortable living. \r\n\r\nPresently she owns two hectares of farmland, on which she has grown some types of potato crops.

Today, BRAC has emerged as an independent, virtually self-financed paradigm in sustainable human development. It is one of the largest Southern development organizations employing over 100,000 people, 61% of which are women, and working with the twin objectives of poverty alleviation and empowerment of the poor. Diagnosing poverty in human terms and recognizing its multifaceted nature, BRAC approaches poverty alleviation with a holistic approach.\r\n<br><br>The successes of BRAC in the international development arena have stimulated a series of discussions, both with African delegations, who have visited BRAC programs, and with donors who work in Asia and Africa. Both the African countries and the donors have encouraged BRAC to join the development campaign in Africa to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and more recently to join the campaign of \u201cending poverty\u201d, which is an area where Africa represents the greatest global challenge.\r\n<br><br> In Uganda, BRAC registered as a Non Government Organization (NGO) in January 2006 to undertake programs in Education, Health, Water & Sanitation, Agriculture & Livestock and Microfinance. The Microfinance and Education are the pioneer programs launched in Uganda and, as of July 2007, had served 21,273 borrowers and enrolled 1,155 adolescents in its education

This is 48-year-old Joyce S. from Mwanza. She is married with four children, between the ages of 10 and 17. Joyce has been running a kuku farm since 2008.\r\n<P>\r\nRaising kuku is a popular micro-business in Tanzania, especially amongst SELFINA clients. Kuku means chickens in Swahili, and raising them for sale is popular for a number of reasons. First, they require little start-up capital. You can start with one or two, and either add to them as you go, or wait for them to multiply naturally! Second, they require little space, so you can sometimes just let them run around your garden or compound. Third, while they are growing they produce eggs which can either be sold to provide a supplementary source of income or eaten to provide a supplementary source of protein.\r\n<P>\r\nJoyce works at this kuku business for eight hours per day, seven days per week. Joyce currently earns about 200 USD from her business. She is requesting a loan of 400 USD in order to buy 200 chickens. In the future, she plans to further increase the number of her chickens. Joyce thanks you for your support!\r\n<P>\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of microcredit in Tanzania. The organization is devoted to the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through microfinance as a practical way to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets; thus, they are deemed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and hence poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":225029,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To purchase more chickens to raise","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mwanza","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.516667 32.9","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-11-18T23:40:18Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Joyce","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-11-26T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2008-12-26T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:14:02Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9970767},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-01-25T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:15:30Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14886984},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-02-24T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:03:55Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20436244},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-03-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:56:39Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130516},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-04-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:24:56Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027313},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-05-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:14:00Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613331},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-06-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:01:56Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010414},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-07-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:38:35Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63232725},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-08-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:52:38Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73664541},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-09-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T02:46:12Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87105272}],"funded_date":"2008-11-19T03:49:04Z","paid_date":"2009-10-16T02:46:12Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jason Groce","image":null}},{"id":78224,"name":"Dionisia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Dionisia is a member of the Amor y Esperanza (\u201cLove and Hope\u201d) Village Bank.

story is representative of her group and of Esperanza's Haitian and Dominican (many of whom recently emigrated to the DR from Haiti) clients generally. Her group is located in Hato Mayor, a poor, agricultural area where running water (none of which is potable) and electricity are unreliable. She makes her home here in a simple structure with her long-term partner and their child.\r\n\r\nMaria is excited to be taking her seventh loan with Esperanza after having successfully repaid her previous loans and grown her business.

She is married and has one child, aged 7. In 2005, she established her cow-raising business. Working seven days a week and five hours a day, she supports her family.  \r\n\r\nShe has already received and successfully repaid two loans from Patan BPW and will use her most recent loan to buy a young, milk-giving cow.  \r\n\r\nIn the future, Indira plans to uplift the economic condition of her family. She thanks you for your support. \r\n\r\nDairy cows are an important source of nutrition and income in Nepal. Cows are never raised for beef, but for their milk, from which curd (duy) and fresh cheese (paneer) are made. Jersey cows are the preferred breed for milking. On average, a dairy cow in Nepal will produce about 10 liters of milk each day. In the local market, a liter of milk sells for about USD $0.50. In addition to producing milk, cows provide dung that is used in home construction, as fuel for fires, and can be captured in methane storage tanks. The purchase of a dairy cow, made possible through a Kiva loan, is an investment that will repay itself many times over.  \r\n\r\nThis loan was administered by Kiva's local partner MFI (microfinance institution), Patan Business and Professional Women. Patan BPW became Kiva's first field partner in Nepal in 2007.  Patan BPW operates throughout the Kathmandu Valley, offering microcredit and business training programs to low-income women. In addition to providing economic opportunity to their clients, Patan BPW seeks to empower Nepali women within the home and community. \r\n\r\nFor more information about Patan BPW, visit our <a

She is also happy and sociable. She lives in her own home with Victor, who is a painter, and their three beloved daughters ages 9, 20 and 24. Dora runs a grocery store in her home using money that she and her partner had saved up. She invested this money in the business, and constantly rotates her products. This way, her business is growing and she has a good customer base. She has been in business for 18 years and is happy. Her daughters help out with the business when she is out. She enjoys her business because it allows her to be close to her family. It also gives her free time for other activities, and her income supports her partner with the household costs. However, she does not like it when her customers are late with payments, but she knows that this should not affect her obligations to MFP.\r\nFurthermore, since her business is popular, she wants to continue it and keep it up.

P. makes lunches every day for the workers at a factory in her town. Each day she and her business partner (another member of the same Friendship Bridge women's group) prepare hot food for the men and then set up outside the factory gates when the men start to break for lunch. They sell a good, simple, hot lunch for about US$1.00. On a normal day they'll sell about 24 lunches. Felipa started the business just 6 months ago with her first Friendship Bridge loan. As before, she'll use the loan as working capital to buy the food she needs to prepare the lunches.<p>Felipa is 41 and is married with six kids aged 3 to 23. Her husband is an electrician. The kids that should be are all in school, but Felipa never went, and can't read or sign her name, so she signs the loan papers with a thumbprint. The family's health is generally good, but her husband has enormous headaches that keep him from work some of the time. Felipa's simple dream is that she wants to prosper more so she can support the kids and keep them in school.\r\n<p>The pictures shows Felipa with her youngest daughter.
