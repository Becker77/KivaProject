She earns her living by operating three business ventures: a general store, pig fattening and selling Avon products.  \r\n\r\nNenita joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2000 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 19 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Nenita  has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 16,000 Philippine pesos (PHP) helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 20,000, thus uplifting the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 20th loan, she is borrowing PHP 17,000,which she intends to use to purchase more stock for her general store and feeds for her pigs so that she can continue to save up for the future and their household consumption. \r\n\r\nNenita F. is a Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means \"honorable\") woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\n<b>About NWTF:<\/b>\r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon.

She earns her living by operating three business ventures:   a general store, farming and pig fattening.  Her husband Rodolfo, who is 49 years old, works as a farmer to earn his living and helps in his wife's business activities.  They have seven children who are 9 to 25 years old. Luzminda joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2006 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 10 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Luzminda has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 18,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 9,600, thus uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 11th loan, she is borrowing PHP 20,000 to buy products to sell so that she can continue to save up for the future expansion of her business. Luzminda is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

has a business making Lontong. Lontong is rice cake wrapped in banana leafs, and usually eaten with lamb curry, soto soup, sate meat shewers, etc. With a capital of Rp100,000 (about US$11) Suhartatik buys rice, banana leaf, etc, that she then processed into lontong. Everyday from 8:00 AM to 5:00PM Suhartatik could produce 20-30 packages of lontong. These lontongs would then be delivered to foodstalls. The profit she made for Rp50,000 (about US$5.50) was used to support her husband to pay for hosuehold expenses, electricity, water of about Rp70,000(about US$7.70)\/month. Suhartatik and her husband lives in a simple house built by themselves from beton and cement floor. All three children have their own family, and live on their own. Loan from DINARI will be used to increase her capital, with the hope that her income would increase.\r\n<p><b>Translated from Bahasa Indonesia by Gwan Liong Ang, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\nSuhartatik mempunyai usaha membuat lontong. Lontong adalah nasi yang dibungkus dengan daun pisang yang biasanya dimakan dengan gule kambing, soto, sate dan lain-lain.. Dengan modal Rp. 100.000,- Suhartatik membeli beras, daun pisang, dan sebagainya yang kemudian diolah menjadi lontong. Setiap hari dari jam 08.00 wita sampai jam 17.00  wita Suhartatik dapat membuat 20-30 bungkus lontong. Lontong-lontong itu kemudian diserahkan ke warung-warung.

She has a son and together they live in her parent's house where Yessi has her business.  Since she was little, Yessi has helped her parents in the fields and since she decided to form her own family, she has dedicated herself to agriculture.  At the same time, she also attended to her store which she has run for the last two years since her parents transferred it to her.  Yessi tried to increase the merchandise in the store, including acquiring more drinks and groceries which has resulted in better sales and profits than just groceries alone. Yessi loves this business because money is constantly in motion and this encourages her to keep with the business. For this reason she opens the store before 6 am every day and stays until 10 pm (at which time she cares for her plants). At the same time, she helps her mother graze cattle. Yessi's hops for the future are to increase the inventory in her store, plant peas, and sell more products in greater quantities so that she can become a prosperous businesswoman. Yessi is very active in her village bank, called \"Campo Verde\", where she is the treasurer.

Anasthasie was born on April 14, 1965 in Cotonou, the economic capital of the Republic of Benin.  She is married to LABITE Lucien, a customs agent, and is the mother of three children who are all in school.  She attended classes up to high school. Then, she had office secretarial training, received her certificate, and worked in a private organization for nine months.\r\n\r\nAnasthasie consciously decided to abandon secretarial work to get started in the commerce of various goods:  candies, cookies, canned foods (milk, sardines, tomatoes), sugar, pasta, laundry detergents, dish soap, and bath soap, batteries, candles, etc. and also mobile phone recharge cards. \r\n\r\nAnasthasie has already benefited from an ALID\u00c9 loan and has repaid it.  She has need of funding to diversify her business by selling staple foods, corn to be exact.  She's therefore requesting a second loan from ALID\u00c9 to buy sacks of corn.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":339731,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Market","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To buy six 100-kg sacks of corn ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BJ","country":"Benin","town":"Cotonou Agence principale","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"9.5 2.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":104,"posted_date":"2009-06-23T05:30:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":275,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Anasthasie","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-07-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":120000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2009-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2009-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2009-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2009-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2010-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2010-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2010-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":15000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.38},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.38},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.38},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.38},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.38},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.38},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.38},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.34}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":34.37,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-20T07:44:10Z","rounded_local_amount":16211.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63126481},{"amount":34.37,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2009-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T10:51:15Z","rounded_local_amount":16211.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73549907},{"amount":34.37,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T11:16:19Z","rounded_local_amount":16211.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":86983698},{"amount":34.37,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2009-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T12:12:04Z","rounded_local_amount":16211.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96896067},{"amount":34.37,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T11:08:45Z","rounded_local_amount":16211.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103735647},{"amount":34.37,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T11:27:11Z","rounded_local_amount":16211.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110623158},{"amount":34.37,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T10:14:19Z","rounded_local_amount":16211.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118019863},{"amount":34.41,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T08:21:53Z","rounded_local_amount":16211.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123858357}],"funded_date":"2009-06-23T11:09:29Z","paid_date":"2010-03-15T08:21:53Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Daniel Kuey","image":669418}},{"id":121073,"name":"Natividad","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Natividad H., 48, a separated mother of two, runs a store with her married daughter where she sells charcoal, firewood and mineral water.

All the milk that is produced is delivered daily to a local company that manufactures all types of dairy products.  Her husband passed away less than 2 years ago, and he was the one who worked with the milking cow.  But when he passed, she and her daughters had to start taking care of the cows.\r\n\r\nThe loan will be used to purchase another milking cow in order to increase the milk production that they have, and that way they will increase their earnings and consequently their quality of life.  Virginia hopes to be able to increase her earnings to the point when she can hire someone to help take care of the cows, so she does not have to depend on her daughters.  This way they can dedicate more time studying and succeeding in school with good grades, attend a university, and complete the dream of her husband.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by

After she finishes making empanadas, she takes advantage of the time to pursue other activities to earn more income.

Cherryl has successfully repaid a previous loan of 3,000 PHP from PMPC which was used as additional capital for her business. Cherryl is requesting a new loan of 14,000 PHP which will be used to redeem her pawned rice field. This will be her second loan from PMPC. \n\nAbout PMPC:\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\n\nNote: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

She earns her living by operating one business venture: a used clothing  business.  Her husband Alfredo P., who is 53 years old, works as a driver to earn his living and also helps in his wife's business activities.  They have 6 children who are between 23 and 29 years old. \r\n\r\nGina joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1999 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 18 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Gina has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 29,500 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 15,000, uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 19th loan, she is borrowing PHP 30,000, which she intends to use to buy more used clothes to sell so that she can continue to save up for future home repairs. Gina P. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\n\r\n In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

His business is located in the busy town of Kakamega, which is in the region of Kenya known for production of sugarcane and is usually well known as the sugar belt region. He and his wife have one child to whom they hope to be able to offer a good education to the university level. \r\n\r\nStephen has been in this business for the last two years and reports that his business is profitable.

She lives with her husband and their two little children in a house inherited from her parents. Since her childhood, she has worked in the fields. Her parents and her husband support her in this work. Thus she has now also planted potatoes, corn, and greens such as spinach, products that are sold in the city. In the same way, she stores part of her crops for their own consumption. As it is an arduous and slow work, in which she has to wait a considerable time until she can harvest, she meanwhile takes advantage of this time to sell articles of clothing to her regular customers, who are generally people whom she already knows and are very responsible in their payments. She confirms that she likes to do these jobs because she has at hand the foods for their own consumption, in addition to the future earnings from the sale of the products she harvests. Therefore, she will continue with this activity for a long time. This will be the third time that she has had a loan with MFP, and she feels that going through the communal bank was a very successful experience that helped her acquire the habit of saving and the responsibility of controlling her bills well. At this time, she will use the loan she is applying for to invest in the purchase of seed potatoes and sacks of fertilizer.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":731114,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy seed potatoes and sacks of fertilizer","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"HUANCAYO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.066667 -75.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-03-17T04:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1100,"lender_count":41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ingrid ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-03-04T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":3000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1100}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":1100,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:51:43Z","rounded_local_amount":3044.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250835271}],"funded_date":"2011-03-17T09:47:59Z","paid_date":"2012-01-15T10:51:43Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Pam McMurry","image":null}},{"id":285824,"name":"Zaheyya","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Zaheyya is a young woman from Ramallah, married and a mother of one daughter and three sons.

This is her fourth loan with Hluvuku in the amount of 15,000 meticals, which she will use to buy construction materials (cement, sand, doors, windows, etc.) to continue improving her home.  The previous loans were in the amount of 8,000 and 15,000 meticals and were used for her home.\r\n\r\nShe promises to make her payments on time so she can take out additional loans in the future.  She hopes to request new loans to finish her home.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":777965,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing

This town is known for its traditional culture and for the fact that it is located just a few minutes from two of the best beaches in the province: San Jacinto and San Clemente.\r\n\r\nHere we meet 34 year-old Lorena who is separated but has three children from her relationship.  Her children are aged 17, 11 and 1.  Her 11 year-old son is in school and her eldest son works.\r\n\r\nTogether with her son, Lorena sells seafood.  Our friend tells us that they used to go round the streets of town selling their products but since she became pregnant with her youngest child she now only sells from home.  Her son is the one who now drives a motorcycle that he owns through the streets of the town and the nearby countryside selling their products.

She\u2019s sold bread since she was a little girl because her mother was also in this occupation.\r\n\r\nThe dates when she sells most is when there are weddings, baptisms or the Day of the Dead because orders are placed three days ahead of time.\r\n\r\nShe requested the loan to buy more ingredients to make bread like: flour, eggs, shortening, yeast and Royal baking powder.\r\n\r\nShe is very grateful to her mother because she taught her this business and she\u2019s very proud of herself for being able to manage it and because her customers are very happy for the good service she provides and because the bread she makes is so delicious and made by an indigenous person who wants to improve herself.\r\n\r\nShe feels happy because when it is vacation season people come to the town and buy bread from her and buy it at wholesale to take it back to where they came from so other people can taste it.\r\n\r\nShe thanks the Fundaci\u00f3n for the support it\u2019s provided and for the interest it shows for her fellow group members.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2000,"image":{"id":886054,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bakery","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy bread baking supplies.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2011-10-11T16:50:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2000,"lender_count":66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Felicitas","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Raymundo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dolores ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Carmen ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juliana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mariana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Margarita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Donaciana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Sixta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Candido ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Tomasa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-09-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":28000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":2000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":2800},{"due_date":"2011-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":2800},{"due_date":"2011-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":2800},{"due_date":"2011-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":2800},{"due_date":"2011-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":2800},{"due_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":2800},{"due_date":"2011-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":2800},{"due_date":"2011-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":2800},{"due_date":"2012-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":2800},{"due_date":"2012-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":2800}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":200}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":600,"local_amount":8400,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:22:42Z","rounded_local_amount":8409.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238618970},{"amount":600,"local_amount":8400,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:03:49Z","rounded_local_amount":8409.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244573215},{"amount":400,"local_amount":5600,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:12:45Z","rounded_local_amount":5606.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250784927},{"amount":400,"local_amount":5600,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T10:27:39Z","rounded_local_amount":5606.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257193494}],"funded_date":"2011-10-15T18:32:38Z","paid_date":"2012-02-15T10:27:39Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":347319,"name":"William","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"William is a farmer and a father of 7 children with the last three still in school.

She is a primary school teacher and a wife of a chauffeur, but their income is insufficient to meet their living costs.

Every morning, Mirna wakes up early to make breakfast and brings her children and grandchildren to school.  She is very happy. <p>\r\n\r\nThe next loan will be paid back in 4 months. She will buy 2 cylinders of fuel to transport her timber.  One-third of the loan (S\/. 600) will be used for transport costs.  She will also buy 1 power saw and the rest will be invested in various timber (Quinilla, Cedar, and a bit of mahogany). <p>\r\n\r\nMirna is very grateful to Manuela Ramos since it has been the means for the loan to be granted to her.

She is a wife and mother of three children. Currently all the children are in school. Selling for the past ten years, she has gained lots of experience in her business. She treks to farming communities to buy her stock of maize from the farmers. This saves her from middlemen who buy from the farmers and resell to her at a higher price.

He is 64 years old and married. Don Pedro has four children, all of whom are married and live on their own. His life partner works as a seamstress in their one-room house, since both of them wish to do humble but dignified work. Don Pedro's goal is to keep his business stable even though the price of fuel fluctuates and causes instability for his family. His dream is for his children to have another source of income so that in the future this fluctuation doesn't cause them any problems. For himself and his partner he dreams of having enough money to provide for his family's needs, since purchasing basic staples has become more expensive. This makes life more and more difficult and obliges him to struggle to support his family.\r\n\r\nHe earns a living as a taxi driver. He's had his business for 27 years. Don Pedro began the business in order to create a source of income for his family, since he needed to provide for their day-to-day needs. Through a friend he managed to acquire the route rights with money loaned to him interest-free by a relative, and with the profits the business generates he'd repay the loan. So from that moment he became an enterprising person, having four children to take care of and prepare for the world of work. Over the past 27 years Don Pedro has changed vehicles four times, as required by the cooperative with which he is associated, in order to offer better service to his clients. He seeks financing to pay for vehicle repairs, for which he'll have to look for parts in Managua, since they can be found at more affordable prices there.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Andrea Rosenberg, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":256554,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Taxi","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"vehicle repairs","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Leon","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.435556 -86.879444","type":"point"}},"partner_id":96,"posted_date":"2009-01-18T15:10:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Pedro Sergio ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-14T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":7000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":875},{"due_date":"2009-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":875},{"due_date":"2009-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":875},{"due_date":"2009-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":875},{"due_date":"2009-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":875},{"due_date":"2009-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":875},{"due_date":"2009-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":875},{"due_date":"2009-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":875}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":46.88},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":46.88},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.88},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.88},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.88},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.88},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.88},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.84}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":46.87,"local_amount":875,"processed_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T08:41:01Z","rounded_local_amount":936.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20399986},{"amount":55.48,"local_amount":1035.67,"processed_date":"2009-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T18:38:27Z","rounded_local_amount":1107.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27091984},{"amount":38.26,"local_amount":714.33,"processed_date":"2009-04-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T16:38:33Z","rounded_local_amount":764.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35985368},{"amount":46.88,"local_amount":875,"processed_date":"2009-05-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T23:09:30Z","rounded_local_amount":936.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44445984},{"amount":46.88,"local_amount":875,"processed_date":"2009-06-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T20:39:29Z","rounded_local_amount":936.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52956625},{"amount":140.63,"local_amount":2625,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T13:59:47Z","rounded_local_amount":2808.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63174052}],"funded_date":"2009-01-18T16:23:29Z","paid_date":"2009-08-15T13:59:47Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Andrea Rosenberg","image":603074}},{"id":88321,"name":"Alima","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Alima G., 45, is married and has five children in high school.

It is due to his hard work and determination that he was able to set up this shop, having worked in daily markets with no store of his own from which to sell his own goods.

Together with her family, she has lived for the past 15 years in the house that she and her husband were able to acquire together.  Shortly after their wedding, she opened a store in their house, which has grown more successful over the years. Beginning only by selling basic staple products, today she has installed a book store section in a part of her store, in which she displays folders and other school items.  Her success is the result of the work that she carries out every day from 6 in the morning to 7 at night, time during which she must attend to both her customers and her family.  None the less, the space that she has is very small and is in need of some repairs, so she wishes in the future to install a proper storefront.  Doing so would enable her to increase her sales and offer products to her neighborhood that, for the most part, are difficult to obtain on account of the far distance of the markets and malls.  This is her thirteenth loan with MFP.  She has been with the group for approximately 7 years, during which time they have helped her to improve her position both socially and with regard to her business.  The 2000 soles that she requests is what she requires to improve her small book store, which is in need of various pieces of school furniture and school supplies, all of which are highly demanded by her customers.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Kevin Lenhart, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":320085,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Incremento de mercader\u00eda","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-05-19T23:20:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":675,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-04-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":301.27},{"due_date":"2009-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":309.17},{"due_date":"2009-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":323.56},{"due_date":"2009-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":340.24},{"due_date":"2009-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":354.44},{"due_date":"2009-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":371.32}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":101.68},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.34},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":109.2},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":114.83},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":119.62},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":101.68,"local_amount":301.27,"processed_date":"2009-05-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T00:56:16Z","rounded_local_amount":308.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44596258},{"amount":104.34,"local_amount":309.17,"processed_date":"2009-06-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:42:28Z","rounded_local_amount":316.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52990536},{"amount":109.2,"local_amount":323.56,"processed_date":"2009-07-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:43:59Z","rounded_local_amount":331.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63211647},{"amount":114.83,"local_amount":340.24,"processed_date":"2009-08-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:24:51Z","rounded_local_amount":348.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73641168},{"amount":119.62,"local_amount":354.44,"processed_date":"2009-09-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:38:15Z","rounded_local_amount":363.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87080608},{"amount":125.33,"local_amount":371.32,"processed_date":"2009-10-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:11:23Z","rounded_local_amount":380.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96996733}],"funded_date":"2009-05-20T02:46:13Z","paid_date":"2009-11-16T03:11:23Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kevin Lenhart","image":null}},{"id":112897,"name":"Chan","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"The two people shown in the picture are Mrs. Chan S. and her husband.

She has been selling shoes there for two years and during that time she has managed to gain many loyal customers who visit her every day, as she offers lower prices than her competitors. In order to increase her sales, she starts already at 9 a.m. and works until 6 p.m. She buys some merchandise in the city center, although most of it comes from merchant friends in other cities, where shoes of a very high quality are produced at a low price. Thus she can earn more money and yet offer good quality to her customers.\r\n<p>\r\nNow Kar\u00edn is planning to expand her stall and offer new brands of shoes. As a member of a community bank, she particularly enjoys the commitment and effort of her group members. During the 13 loans she has had so far with Microfinanzas Prisma, she went through many difficult situations that she managed to overcome. She will invest the 3000 nuevos soles of her loan in the purchase of a showcase for the new shoes that she will buy.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Robert Mouris, Kiva

El negocio de Nelva es el alquiler de cabinas de Internet, ella brinda este servicio desde muy tempranas horas, su local es muy concurrido, sobre todo por los j\u00f3venes de su barrio, quienes al ver el buen trato que reciben y la comodidad de las cabinas, no dudaron en hacer de este lugar su preferido. Lo que m\u00e1s le gusta de su trabajo es atender bien a sus clientes, ya que sabe que de ellos dependen sus ingresos. Lleva 2 a\u00f1os con este negocio y considera que lo m\u00e1s dif\u00edcil es tener que permanecer todo el d\u00eda dentro de su local, ya que no le da mucho tiempo para salir a pasear con sus queridas hijas, por eso espera que en el futuro su negocio crezca y le genere mejores ingresos.

She lives in a rented house with her husband Roger and their twin daughters, Tanya and Erika, who are 7 years old.  She hopes to give them both a good life.  Nelva manages an Internet caf\u00e9.  She offers her services starting in the early morning hours because her location is very popular among the young people in the neighborhood.  They enjoy being treated well and the convenience of the cubicles, so they don\u2019t hesitate in making her business one of their favorite places to visit.  What Nelva likes most about her job is serving her customers, because she knows her income is dependent on them.  She has been in business for 2 years and the hardest part of her job is having to be present at her business the entire day, which does not give her much time to spend with her daughters.  She hopes that her business continues to grow in the future and generate more revenue.  \r\n<p>\r\nThis will be Nelva\u2019s fifth loan with MFP.  Since she wants to access more loans in the future, she is eager to make her payments on time and without any delays.

Nino, Tukuran, ZDS. She is 38 years old. Felisa is the group leader of a 2-member group loan offered by PMPC. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nFelisa is married and has 3 school-aged children. To make a living, Felisa owns & operates a business venture in the retail sector operating a clothing business. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from providing shirt making services to local community members. Felisa is just starting this business.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Felisa joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and to have the ability to engage in business activities. Felisa has successfully repaid a previous loan of 11,000.00 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to invest in expanding the business. Felisa is requesting a new loan of 13000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional fabrics & materials. This will be the 5th loan taken out by Felisa from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to financially support immediate members of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":478429,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cloth &

She is married to Prudencio A. Jr., a company supervisor, and they are blessed with five children. She helps her husband support the family so that they can have a better life.  She has been selling door-mats and rags for ten years. She also sells cosmetic products.\r\n\r\nAnita has been a regular member of Center for Community Transformation* (CCT) for more than four years now. She regularly attends their weekly fellowship meetings and pays her weekly dues consistently. Due to her good repayment performance with her previous loans, she has been able to borrow 15 times in CCT\u2019s Cooperative.  She is consistent in paying her dues because she used the money she borrowed as additional working capital for her business. She earns a profit of PHP 15,000 per month.  \r\n\r\nNow, with your help, she would like to apply for a PHP 50,000 loan.

C. experiences immense satisfaction when she says that her business has made it possible for her family to support her daughters\u2019 education so that they can become professionals.  She learned her trade from her husband, who has a family tradition of preparing delicious empanadas, cariba\u00f1olas (dumplings made of cassava and potato dough, stuffed with meat and vegetables), and finger foods.  Her family also sells meats, fish entrails, chicken, as well as harvested fruits.  She now hopes to buy an electric mill and plastic containers for grinding corn.  The task of milling and grinding is the chance to start another micro-enterprise since people are willing to pay for this service.  Therefore, she wants to buy all the primary materials to get started.  Nayibe also plans to buy cassava in bulk to grind into flour to fulfill orders.  For this reason, she is requesting her second loan in the amount 1,100,000 COP.  She says that after receiving her first loan, she was able to complete her customers\u2019 orders more easily because she didn\u2019t have to buy supplies every day and always had enough to address emergency situations.\r\n\r\nNayibe lives in the Loma Fresca neighborhood in southwestern Barranquilla with her husband and two children.  Her oldest daughter is finishing her college degree and the younger one is studying for a technical degree.  She now dreams that her children will successfully finish their studies, so that she and her husband can see the fruits of their hard work.  Her greatest challenge is working in a small space from which to develop her business.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva

They all live together in a rented room within her mother-in-law\u2019s house.\r\n\r\nFor the past six years she and her husband have farmed peas and potatoes which are the items in highest demand and that sell for the best prices in the city of Tarma\u2019s markets.  In her free time she hires herself out to work other farmers\u2019 fields where the daily salary is 20 soles.\r\n\r\nWhat she enjoys most is harvesting potatoes and peas but what is the heaviest work is having to water her plants at night fighting against the cold and even against the rains.\r\n\r\nTogether with this activity, she also raises calves, pigs, bulls and asses for subsequent sale during festive occasions or to have a reserve in case of some unforeseen economic need.  \r\n\r\nShe owns several hectares of farmland but even so would like to have a spacious piece of property in the city to build her house so that her children can live in comfort.\r\n\r\nThis is her 6th loan with MFP.

After that, and thanks to her husband's hard work, they were able to invest in a variety store.

She lives in  Brgy. Cansusi, Dalaguete, Cebu. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2006 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her general store business, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of 12,000 PHP. Meriam is borrowing 26,000 PHP so that she can continue to purchase more stock to sell. This will be her 10th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of 29,000 PHP, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Meriam aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She is single and lives comfortably with her mother, father and brother, 25 years old, in her parents\u2019 home. Giannina is a nurse practitioner, working in a health center, but seeing that her income was not enough, decided to break in to the business of selling women's clothing. For this, she has the support of an aunt who lives in Lima, who is the one who sent the clothes to be sold to her customer through orders. What she likes about this activity is that it will generate extra income for personal expenses, distract her and socialize with colleagues and friends. On the other hand, what she does not like about this activity would be the lateness of the payment of credits granted, but that does not discourage her and she plans to look for responsible customers that will guarantee payment for their purchases. This will be the loan number 2 with the institution MFP therefore she hopes the small loan with meet her goals. On the other hand, she is committed to being punctual with the repayment of fees as in the previous loan.

She has 4 grown children.  In 2003, she joined the organization to help her invest in buying livestock in which she raises at home.  From a small investment, she is able to expand her business after 5 seasons.  Presently, she is able to increase her business by raising a variety of farm animals; cows, pigs and chickens all in large amount. Every month, she is able to retain a steady income and her family finance has since been stable.  Besides raising livestock, she was able to purchase cows from other countries to breed.  All of her children all grown and have job stability.  Every month they are able to contribute some of their earnings to the family business.  The family past income has gone from being average to a dramatic increase with the business success.  This time, she is asking for a loan of 15.000.000d to buy more chickens and cows to raise.  A small portion of this loan will be use to buy animal food in bulk at a wholesale price.  Her income is 3.500.000d\/month.\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Vietnamese by Lynn Nguyen, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\nCh\u1ecb Nguy\u1ec5n Th\u1ecb C\u1ea3nh n\u0103m nay 55 tu\u1ed5i.

Currently she is in charge of a school kiosk, in which she has put a lot of effort so that it is well-stocked with products.  Her kiosk is very popular among the children during recess, and she attends to them with a lot of patience and care.

He needs this loan in order to buy three young bulls to fatten up and sell at a profit.\r\n\r\nHe has been doing this for a long time and began growing the basic grains only during the winter months with the help of his wife, who also helps him doing other important things around their home.\r\n\r\nHe currently continues farming and raising livestock and would like to be able to do this year round, as his principle work is farming in the winter and raising livestock in the summer, which gives him another source of income.\r\n\r\nMiguel has had eight previous loans for this type of activity and he has been working with Ceprodel for the past five years.

- t\u1ec9nh B\u1eafc Ninh.  She is married and has 2 school-aged children.  To make a living, Th\u01b0 owns & operates a business making & selling food.  The main source of income for the business comes from selling rice products in the local community.  She has been engaged in this business for over 11 years and earns approximately 3,600,000 VND a month.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Th\u01b0  joined SEDA to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,600,000 VND from SEDA, which was used to purchase raw ingredients needed to make products for sale.  She is now requesting a new loan of 6,496,000 VND, which will be used for the same purpose.  This will be Th\u01b0\u2019s 4th loan from SEDA.  She  plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business  to improve and expand it.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout SEDA:\r\n\r\nThe mission of SEDA (Center of Small Enterprise Development Assistance) is to provide microfinance services to the low income and disadvantaged people in rural areas of Hanoi and the Northern provinces of Vietnam.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in Vietnamese while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":579071,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

With the credit that she is requesting, she will finish construction on the floor of the room that she will rent out next. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Anne Rodriguez, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":586961,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Hotel","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"To finish construction on the floor of the room that she will rent ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-08-20T20:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":725,"lender_count":27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-07-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":164.8},{"due_date":"2010-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":171.62},{"due_date":"2010-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":180.98},{"due_date":"2010-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":186.21},{"due_date":"2010-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":195.66},{"due_date":"2011-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":203.49},{"due_date":"2011-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":211.63},{"due_date":"2011-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":220.09},{"due_date":"2011-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":228.9},{"due_date":"2011-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":236.62}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.74},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.21},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65.61},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":67.5},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.93},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":73.76},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.72},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.78},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.98},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.77}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":59.74,"local_amount":164.8,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:39:39Z","rounded_local_amount":167.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166887512},{"amount":62.21,"local_amount":171.62,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:25:54Z","rounded_local_amount":174.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172154514},{"amount":65.61,"local_amount":180.98,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T15:13:35Z","rounded_local_amount":183.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177449825},{"amount":67.5,"local_amount":186.21,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T14:59:53Z","rounded_local_amount":188.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182588521},{"amount":70.93,"local_amount":195.66,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T14:04:33Z","rounded_local_amount":198.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188725030},{"amount":73.76,"local_amount":203.49,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T04:39:27Z","rounded_local_amount":206.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191463133},{"amount":76.72,"local_amount":211.63,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T08:51:22Z","rounded_local_amount":214.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195886559},{"amount":79.78,"local_amount":220.09,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:37:59Z","rounded_local_amount":223.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201326895},{"amount":82.98,"local_amount":228.9,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:32:21Z","rounded_local_amount":232.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206195495},{"amount":85.77,"local_amount":236.62,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:42:16Z","rounded_local_amount":240.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211269278}],"funded_date":"2010-08-21T00:05:02Z","paid_date":"2011-06-15T11:42:16Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Anne Rodriguez","image":null}},{"id":228484,"name":"Dina","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Dina, de 62 a\u00f1os, vive en su casa que es propia en compa\u00f1\u00eda de su esposo Jos\u00e9 de 65 a\u00f1os y de sus 4 hijos mayores, de los cuales 2 son casados, pero aun viven con ella.

Two of her children are married even though they still live with her.  Dina earns her living by selling beauty products and accessories of a well-known brand for the past year.  She remembers that her business was difficult to get established at first.  Now she generates a steady stream of income from her regular customers who place orders with her on a frequent basis.  She extends credit to her customers and likes those occasions when they pay on time.  What she does not enjoy is having to attract new customers since there have been several instances when she did not get paid and accumulated heavy losses.

For her it is difficult work due to the fact that she must carry heavy pots to her place of business that is located in the door of her house.  With the income that she earns she maintains and pays for the studies of her two children.  A short time ago her husband passed away and left her a widow.  Now, the loan will allow her to buy a car to be able to work in public transportation and thus to improve her income.

He lives in the city of Malambo where he works selling a variety of merchandise such as oil paintings, fried snack foods and prepared lunches. He began his business experience seven years ago with a shop, but he extended credit that in many cases was unrecoverable, and had to change the business so he could achieve alternatives which were more profitable and less risky. Thus, with the support of his two younger children, they began to sell products through specialized guides to which they later added sandals, costume jewelry and the making of oil paintings.  Efrain is always looking for income opportunities to bring in money every day. He began selling fried snacks on a daily basis and lunches on the weekends. \r\n\r\nHis goal is to progress in his business little by little, and be able to set up a shop, and stock it with all the merchandise he sells. His greatest challenge is to be able to offer a quality education to his children. This Kiva credit is his first loan with the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo. With it he will purchase five dozen pairs of sandals, seven oil paintings, handicrafts, ceramics, costume jewelery and a large volume of basic ingredients for making fried foods and the lunches he sells weekly. Currently his customer base is growing day by day, and, as he makes his dream come true, he continues on diligently to bring in a family income by means of his business, in which he achieves a profitability of no less than 51%. \r\n\r\n      "}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":778033,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy five dozen pairs of sandals, seven oil paintings, handicrafts, ceramics, costume jewelry, clocks and a large volume of basic ingredients for making fried foods.

from Tanzania!  This is 49 year old Rebecca N. from Mwanza. She is married with three children, between the ages of 25 and 28 years old. She is also responsible for supporting a dependant, a child whose parents could not look after. Rebecca N. has been running a Duka business. She owns a small duka or neighborhood shop in the city. She has been selling common household and grocery items since 2004. Rebecca's business is doing well. She works at her business for 13 hours a day, 7 days a week and currently earns about 144USD. She is requesting a loan of 400USD in order to buy more supplies of her shop like breads, soaps, sugar, biscuits, lotions, and cakes. In the future, she plans to expand her business. Rebecca thanks you for your support!\r\n\r\nABOUT SELFINA!\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":256700,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To buy more supplies of her shop like breads, soaps, sugar, biscuits, lotions, and cakes ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mwanza","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.516667 32.9","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-01-18T15:00:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rebecca","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-30T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-04-29T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-05-29T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:04:45Z","rounded_local_amount":104000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20436434},{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-03-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:57:31Z","rounded_local_amount":104000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130706},{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-04-29T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:26:53Z","rounded_local_amount":104000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027503},{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-05-29T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:15:35Z","rounded_local_amount":104000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613504},{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-06-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:02:46Z","rounded_local_amount":104000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010583}],"funded_date":"2009-01-18T15:35:17Z","paid_date":"2009-07-16T00:02:46Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Dave Gibbons","image":608904}},{"id":88353,"name":"Dembagnouma Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Les membres du groupe  Dembagnouma sont mari\u00e9s, \u00e2g\u00e9s de  25 \u00e0 51 ans, m\u00e8res de 5 enfants en moyenne et vivent dans des familles traditionnelles \u00e9largies dans le quartier Ganabougou de la pr\u00e9fecture de Yanfolila (troisi\u00e8me r\u00e9gion administrative de la r\u00e9publique du Mali).\nCes femmes qui font le commerce des articles divers,  sont partenaires de Soro Yiriwaso  depuis 3 ans .Elles sont \u00e0 leur cinqui\u00e8me pr\u00eat de groupe.

Despite her young age and of being single, she works very hard day to day to earn the necessary money for her and her mother. At the store she sells bottled juices, snacks and also makes pupusas (a typical Salvadoran dish made with corn or rice and mixed with pork rind, cheese and beans in a tortilla). Her mother helps her with the business, and both give a lot of effort because it is the only source of income they have. Because the sales are quite acceptable, Morena is requesting a loan to have the necessary capital to purchase the ingredients to make pupusas since that is the best-selling product. Morena wishes to improve her sales to increase her earnings and have more economic stability.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Marty Greenstein, Kiva

He is requesting his sixth loan from AFODENIC to buy zinc to put a new roof onto his house, since his current roof is in bad shape and leaks in the winter. He has also invested his previous loans in his home (for example, to build walls and to paint). He doesn't receive financial help from anyone else, since his two children are college students. Hector is a cooling system technician, and on weekends he repairs dental equipment and refrigerators, which earns him about 5000 cordobas (US$340) per month to help pay for his children's education. With his previous five loans, Hector has shown himself to be reponsable with repayments; he has an excellent credit history. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Cynthia McMurry, Kiva

They do not own their own home, since they live in her mother's home, but manage all their expenses independently. Luz tells us that the loans, which she has received thus far, have allowed her to catch up with her debts and invest in her own business selling fruits and grains.  This is a business she has had for 21 years.  Currently, Luz works Monday to Sunday (from 7 a.m. to 6 p.m.) in a market.  With the funds she receives from this loan, she plans to purchase papayas, pineapples, oranges, peas, corn, etc. and will supply her business.

That is not true for Kyrgyzstan. The most necessary food supplies like meat, fruits, and milk products are a luxury for a typical rural family. The government regulations fail to efficiently allocate locally-made products, while most of it goes for cheap export. Local citizens purchase goods at quite a high price.\r\n\r\nBurulcha N., 53, is a leader of this group. She is a junior nurse in a sanitary-epidemic hospital in the small town of Toktogul. She is a widow and has four grown children. She worked hard her entire career in a hospital but still could not provide a good life with the salary of a social worker. She did a tremendous job in satisfying all the needs of her children, and now it is her children\u2019s turn to bring some fresh air into their mother\u2019s life. \r\n\r\nBurulcha\u2019s youngest son spent his salary to purchase cattle. Together, they managed to gradually increase the number of cattle. The biggest challenge for this family is to find capital for conducting business, because the input prices rise every year and sometimes it gets hard to cover production costs. Burulcha has organized a group of people, each of whom has unique financial hardships. Burulcha is asking for a loan of 10,000 soms so that she can buy additional cattle and make general repairs on her house. \r\n\r\n --- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance (MBF), a young, ambitious and socially-focused microfinance institution in Kyrgyzstan. \r\nMBF is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development and upholds the triple bottom line \u2013 People (building human capital and taking care of its customers as well as society), Planet (keeping environmentally friendly) and Profit (earning revenue to expand autonomously).

But also she has learned to create strategies to make the best out of difficult times in sales. Because of this she wants to have additional working capital to buy and the opportunity to sell in the same sense, because even though with the sale she gets a profit margin of 50%, she wants to make it grow. \r\n\r\nHer customers are recommended and with them the agreed payment system is no more than two months to recover the investment and utility quickly.

children, two of whom are younger than 15. They all live in a two-room apartment in the Tumuku Belo subdivision. Comfort made up her mind to join GHAPE in 2009 when she saw her friends doing well because of loans from GHAPE. She received her first loan of 50,000 XAF, which she used for her provisions store.\r\n\r\nComfort is requesting a second loan to expand. She needs the loan to buy kerosene for 8,000 XAF,  garri (a popular West African food made from cassava tubers) for 21,000 XAF, groundnuts for 9,500 XAF, goats for 27,500 XAF and corn for 14,000 XAF. Comfort knows that her business is going to succeed since it's located in a good site and she buys at good prices. Her business has helped to improve the living standards of the people in her community. The lone difficulty she suffered from in life was when her child was desperately sick. The profits from this loan will help to boost Comfort's business and to take care of the family's health. Comfort prefers GHAPE for trust and their training.\r\n\r\nAbout GHAPE \r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon.  GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach.  Every client is trained in business management, basic health, life skills, financial management, profits and losses, and family values.  Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement.  GHAPE instils a sense of family and community within its clients and staff and has developed a strong bond of trust between the organization and its clients.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":789751,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Market","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy corn, garri and beans for resale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CM","country":"Cameroon","town":"Tumuku Belo Sub Division","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"6 12","type":"point"}},"partner_id":40,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":200,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Comfort ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-06-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XAF","disbursal_amount":80000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2011-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2011-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2011-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2011-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2011-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2011-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2011-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2011-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2011-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2011-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2011-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2011-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2012-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2012-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2012-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2012-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2012-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2012-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2012-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2012-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":3333.41}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.33},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.34},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.33},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.33},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.34},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.33},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.33},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.34},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":8.33},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":8.33},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":8.34},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":8.33},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":8.33},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":8.34},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":8.33},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":8.33},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.34},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.33},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.33},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.34},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.33},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.33},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.34},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sharon K-S","image":1103477}},{"id":310460,"name":"53.thieu Trung.

She is 48 and a member of the \u201cCaminando Juntos\u201d [Walking Together] communal bank, a group of 12 members who work in diverse businesses. Sabina has sold food for 8 years. That is, she sells lunches at a factory. This business was started because Sabina wanted to be financially independent and at the same time help her husband with the household expenses as well as feel fulfilled as a woman. Thanks to the example that Sabina has given her children, they opened their own businesses as well. With her hard work and dedication, she has been able to obtain more income and buy things for her home little by little. More than anything, her family has a better quality of life.

History of note includes: it was once a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; the birthplace of the great Persian poet Rudaki; and the birthplace of the most famous Islamic philosopher Ibn Sina (Avicenna). The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p> \r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n<p>\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients have a viable business proposition when they request a loan. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and IMON will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

They each expect to make a monthly profit of 32,250 FCFA,  part of which will be put into savings and to meet the needs of their families, and the rest will be invested in their business.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Shannon Arnold, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":503172,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"to buy various supplies","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sikasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.316667 -5.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2010-03-10T15:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":625,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mariam ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alima","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Korotoumou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Djelika ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-02T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":300000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-08-29T07:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.17},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.16},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.17},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.17},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.16},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":104.17,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T12:14:49Z","rounded_local_amount":50120.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136746534},{"amount":104.16,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T10:03:07Z","rounded_local_amount":50120.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144779075},{"amount":104.17,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T10:03:43Z","rounded_local_amount":50120.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144779076},{"amount":104.17,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:17:03Z","rounded_local_amount":50120.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151961278},{"amount":104.16,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T12:01:47Z","rounded_local_amount":50120.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159699406},{"amount":104.17,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:58:34Z","rounded_local_amount":50120.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166913327}],"funded_date":"2010-03-11T04:08:02Z","paid_date":"2010-09-15T10:58:34Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Shannon Arnold","image":null}},{"id":187547,"name":"Ruby","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ruby T.

She is 38 years old. Juanita is the group leader of a 7-member group loan offered by ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nJuanita is married and has 3 school-aged children. To make a living, Juanita owns & operates a general store. The main source of income for the business comes from selling a variety of different products in the local community. Juanita has been engaged in her business for over 3 years and earns approximately 6000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Juanita joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Juanita has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Juanita is requesting a new loan of 7000 PHP which will be used to purchase new items to expand product offering. This will be the second loan taken out by Juanita from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 29 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still lives in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients can run successful businesses. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.
