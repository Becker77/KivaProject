It was a key post along the Silk Road and is where the rule of Alexander the Great ended. It is famous for its great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets such as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to epic mountain passes, communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n\r\n<p>But, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Ikromjon is a very courageous man who is characterized as someone who can manage tough jobs like raising cattle and agriculture. He's the father of three adult children and has the responsibility of supporting his family and providing them with everything that they need. In spite of his difficult economic situation, and after much time, Ikromjon has been able to get ahead in his business through the purchase of cattle to breed on his property. His greatest goal nowadays is to improve his economic situation and provide a better way of life for his family. It's for this reason that Ikromjon comes to IMON International for loans for the purchase of animals so that he may breed them.    \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He runs a charcoal wholesale store jointly with his wife, Pamela. He has been in this business for ten years, during which he has grown from a retailer to wholesaler.\r\n\r\nVitalis benefited from a previous loan from KADET which he paid well without any difficulties.

She lives in Purok Kakahuyan, Brgy. Daga, Cadiz City, Negros Occidental. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2009 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. \r\n\r\nBy working hard in her  General Store  business, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 7000. Rhea is now borrowing PHP 16,000 so that she  can continue to purchase more stock to sell.   This will be her 5th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of 14,000 PHP, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. \r\n\r\nRhea aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the  Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\n\r\n In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

Hong is the group leader of a three-member group loan offered by Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they all are responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is 34. Thi Tran. Thieu Hoa (12.13.34).\n\nHong is married and has one school-aged child. \n\nTo making a living, Hong operates a family member's business venture in the agriculture sector raising livestock, primarily cattle, for sale. Hong has been engaged in this business for over five years and earns approximately 1,500,000 VND a month.\n\nIn 2011, Hong joined Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women to gain access to financial services to help improve her business and living situation.  Hong is requesting for the first time a loan from Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women. She is now requesting a new loan of 5,787,900 VND, which will be used to purchase baby livestock to raise and sell in the future. The loan will be the 1st loan taken out by the borrower from Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women. Hong plans to use the additional revenue generated from the loan to improve and expand her business.\n\nAbout the other borrowers in the group:\n\n1. Phung Thi Ngan (10) is a 36-year-old woman who is requesting a 5,787,900 VND loan to support her business in the agriculture sector raising livestock.\n\n2. Nguyen Thi Nghia (9) is a 39 year-old female who is requesting a 5,787,900 VND loan to support her business in the agriculture sector raising livestock.\n\nAbout Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women:\nThe mission of Fund for Thanh Hoa Poor Women (FPW) is to provide sustainable financial services to disadvantaged women in rural areas in the Thanh Hoa province.\n\n\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in Vietnamese while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\n\n\nH\u1ed3ng L. th\u1ecb T.

For the past nine years she has had a convenience store that she runs herself, and every day she is mindful of whether she has to restock her business. She sells everything from products of primary need to fruits and meats depending on her capital and the demands of her customers. Her suppliers come to her store with the products that are in highest demand, such as soft drinks, milk and other items. For Angelina, it is an advantage since it eliminates traveling and transporting the products, which she normally picks up in the city center.

She has already received and successfully repaid five loans from Patan BPW and used her most recent to buys a young milk-giving cow.  \r\n\r\nDairy cows are an important source of nutrition and income in Nepal. Cows are never raised for beef, but for their milk, from which curd (duy) and fresh cheese (paneer) are made. Jersey cows are the preferred breed for milking. On average, a dairy cow in Nepal will produce about 10 liters of milk each day. In the local market, a liter of milk sells for about USD $0.50.

She lives with her father's family with her children and other households.\r\nNot having attended school for social reasons (conservative and religious parents), she began to do business with her parents. Her mother sold spices and her father had a store that sold grains. Rich with this practical experience, she changed by herself to run a business selling atiek\u00e9 (couscous made from fermented manioc), potatoes, and spices. She has run this business for twenty-four years and enjoys a large notoriety and customer base. She is very much in demand at the March\u00e9 Ch\u00e2teau.\r\nIn order to cope with the demands of her customers and to make more profits, she is asking for a new loan. She has been in connection with Soro Yiriwaso for sixty-six months, and has had three group loans and four individual loans which were correctly repaid. She is at her fifth individual loan, which she intends to use to buy two tons of atiek\u00e9. She stocks up in Sikasso, Bamako and in C\u00f4te-d'Ivoire. \r\nKorotimi sells for cash and on credit to customers mostly made up of women. With this loan she intends to increase her monthly profit to 200,000 francs. This profit will allow her to repay her loans and to participate in tontines (investment schemes).\r\nHer ambition is to build a house to live in."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":875,"image":{"id":984970,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"to buy atiek\u00e9, a type of couscous made of fermented manioc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"S\u00e9gou","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2012-01-17T16:10:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":875,"lender_count":30,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Korotimi ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-11T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":450000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":875,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-11T08:00:00Z","amount":40909.09},{"due_date":"2012-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":40909.09},{"due_date":"2012-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":40909.09},{"due_date":"2012-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":40909.09},{"due_date":"2012-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":40909.09},{"due_date":"2012-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":40909.09},{"due_date":"2012-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":40909.09},{"due_date":"2012-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":40909.09},{"due_date":"2012-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":40909.09},{"due_date":"2012-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":40909.09},{"due_date":"2013-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":40909.1}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.55},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.54},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.55},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.54},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.55},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.54},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.55},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.54},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.55},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.54},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.55}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":79.55,"local_amount":40909.09,"processed_date":"2012-03-11T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-11T08:20:00Z","rounded_local_amount":40988.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270140096},{"amount":79.54,"local_amount":40909.09,"processed_date":"2012-04-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-21T08:34:35Z","rounded_local_amount":40988.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276757064},{"amount":79.55,"local_amount":40909.09,"processed_date":"2012-05-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T19:01:19Z","rounded_local_amount":40988.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283251823},{"amount":79.54,"local_amount":40909.09,"processed_date":"2012-06-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T10:18:44Z","rounded_local_amount":40988.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287410827},{"amount":79.55,"local_amount":40909.09,"processed_date":"2012-07-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:38:27Z","rounded_local_amount":40988.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294448971},{"amount":79.54,"local_amount":40909.09,"processed_date":"2012-08-08T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T11:39:45Z","rounded_local_amount":40988.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301502741},{"amount":79.55,"local_amount":40909.09,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T11:08:14Z","rounded_local_amount":40988.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308268419},{"amount":79.54,"local_amount":40909.09,"processed_date":"2012-10-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T15:33:53Z","rounded_local_amount":40988.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315498832},{"amount":79.55,"local_amount":40909.09,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T16:38:28Z","rounded_local_amount":40988.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323102885},{"amount":79.54,"local_amount":40909.09,"processed_date":"2012-12-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T15:58:06Z","rounded_local_amount":40988.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331243164},{"amount":79.55,"local_amount":40909.1,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T18:28:58Z","rounded_local_amount":40988.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339624755}],"funded_date":"2012-01-17T20:41:05Z","paid_date":"2013-02-15T18:28:58Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":808704,"name":"Navoye's Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Le groupement   est mis en place depuis le 15 Mai 2009 jour de son inauguration.

Guljahon has a trading place at the central local market of the city of Istaravshan. All of the fabrics are supplied from the neighboring country China. Guljahon is trying to have a wide range of goods, and thus be able to meet the requirements of her customers and their different levels of income.<p>As with all mothers, Guljahon is doing her best for her children to be well-educated and happy. Today, Guljahon is requesting US$600 to purchase new fabrics for the summer season. Guljahon is counting on your help, and you can be an important part of the growth of Guljahon\u2019s business."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":172559,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cloth & Dressmaking Supplies","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To purchase new fabric and increase the range of goods.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Istaravshan","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39.910833 69.006389","type":"point"}},"partner_id":100,"posted_date":"2008-07-04T01:20:19Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":600,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Guljahon","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-07-18T19:36:35Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":600,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":60},{"due_date":"2008-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":60},{"due_date":"2008-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":60},{"due_date":"2008-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":60},{"due_date":"2008-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":60},{"due_date":"2009-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":60},{"due_date":"2009-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":60},{"due_date":"2009-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":60},{"due_date":"2009-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":60},{"due_date":"2009-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":60}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":60},{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":60},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":60},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":60},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":60},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":60},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":60},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":60},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":60,"local_amount":60,"processed_date":"2008-08-06T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T03:42:00Z","rounded_local_amount":60,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":288009},{"amount":60,"local_amount":60,"processed_date":"2008-09-06T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-09-09T02:08:59Z","rounded_local_amount":60,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":318330},{"amount":60,"local_amount":60,"processed_date":"2008-10-06T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-07T07:08:02Z","rounded_local_amount":60,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":350221},{"amount":120,"local_amount":120,"processed_date":"2008-12-18T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-15T23:38:19Z","rounded_local_amount":120,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9943308},{"amount":60,"local_amount":60,"processed_date":"2009-01-18T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T13:10:47Z","rounded_local_amount":60,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":10220396},{"amount":60,"local_amount":60,"processed_date":"2009-02-18T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T09:22:16Z","rounded_local_amount":60,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20409336},{"amount":60,"local_amount":60,"processed_date":"2009-03-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T19:36:03Z","rounded_local_amount":60,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27102387},{"amount":60,"local_amount":60,"processed_date":"2009-04-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T20:35:21Z","rounded_local_amount":60,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35996630},{"amount":60,"local_amount":60,"processed_date":"2009-05-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T00:07:52Z","rounded_local_amount":60,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44579445}],"funded_date":"2008-07-04T19:36:35Z","paid_date":"2009-06-16T00:07:52Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":57369,"name":"Afi","description":{"languages":["fr"],"texts":{"fr":"Born in Ghana in 1968, Mrs. Afi K. is married and the mother of one child.

It was a key post along the Silk Road and is where the rule of Alexander the Great ended. It is famous for its great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets such as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to epic mountain passes, communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n\r\n<p>But Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

Komil is a 49-year-old married man who owns a small farm. He is hard-working and has fought to provide for his family and to educate his children, who today are working adults, thanks to his example. Komil runs a business of raising and selling cattle. He has 15 years of experience in this field. Since cattle raising and selling is a profitable business, Komil has become a very successful businessman in a short time. He works very hard and spends all his time with his animals, cleaning, feeding and pasturing them. Now Komil wants to expand his business and buy more cattle, so he applied for a loan of $800. Komil thanks all lenders for their support.  \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International:\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and its famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n\r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

He is 30; is married; and is the father of 3 children who are 9, 7, and 7 months.  The oldest 2 go to school.  He finished studying only through 5th grade due to his parents' lack of financial resources.  He lives in his own home with his family and doesn't support anyone besides them.  He left Manjacaze for Boane by himself 7 years ago in search of better living conditions.  He has his own business.  He doesn't have any employees and sells kitchen supplies.  He manages to save around 600 meticais a month in his bank account after paying all of his home's expenses.  He has never had a loan with another bank.  He became familiar with Hluvuku through his friends.  This is his 3rd loan, and it is for 12,000 meticais.  He will use it to buy products for his business (pots and pans, thermoses, kitchen supplies, etc.) to respond to market demand.  His previous loans were for 10,000 meticais and 15,000 meticais, and both were used for the same purpose.  In the future, he hopes to request more loans to be able to expand his home so he can provide better living conditions for his family.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Tanya Harper, Kiva

They live in a home they own in the Ayacuchan rain forest located in the town of San Francisco. Alejandra dreamed of getting a degree in agriculture, but she ended up making a living selling food. She was a farmer during her youth, but she opened up her food stand offering typical regional dishes because she always wanted to do something on her own. Of course more than once she suffered terrible setbacks, but she knew how to get back up. She created her own seasoning, made a variety of typical dishes and sold all kinds of meals to her customers, and in this way she steadily grew her business. To her family she was revolutionary, and thus feels happy and satisfied with what she has achieved so far. In general, her stand is run out of her home. That's why she wants to expand her restaurant in the future, with the goal of attracting more customers.

Prior to joining ASHI, Josefina had no access to capital to support her entrepreneurial dreams.\r\n\r\nPositive growth from Josefina\u2019s businesses has helped her fund the education of her children.

Therefore, she is now requesting another loan for the much larger amount of 45,000 PHP to purchase other fishing materials and to support the maintenance of her sari-sari store. This will allow her to grow her businesses further so that her children can fulfill their dreams of completing college degrees and experience a life that\u2019s full of happiness.\r\n\r\nJosefina\u2019s family feels very happy with the loan that improved their lives.

He thanks all lenders for their support. \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International:\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes having been a key post along the Silk Road and having witnessed the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to epic mountain passes, a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC, and communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still lives in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She divorced her husband because of problems with incompatibility.  She has a 7-year-old daughter who she cares for and lives with her mother in the city of Tarma.  Gloria has experience in commerce and sales and has a business selling cheeses, fudge, sweets, Tarma breads, sodas, etc. from a stall at the bus station.  \"On weekends sales are good and the quickest moving items are fudge and cheeses which the visitors take back to their relatives.\", she explains.  Gloria invests quite a bit of money in this activity and buys rounds of cheese for 250 PEN, small trays of fudge for 50 PEN, breads for 60 PEN and varied sweets.  At the end of the day she earns about 50 PEN for her efforts.\r\n\r\n\"The business is profitable, but one must invest in products.  If the customers see there is variety they will come and buy, so I have to have fixed suppliers.\", she says.\r\n\r\nIn the future Gloria would like to open another business in another terminal, so she will keep working to save money.  This is her second loan through MFP and she is committed to paying it back on time.  She has been in her communal bank for two cycles and feels very comfortable and hopeful.  She will use the loan to buy products such as fudge, cheeses, sodas and sweets for her business.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":933777,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To buy fudge, cheeses, sodas and sweets for her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-12-02T09:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":575,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gloria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-11-21T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":211.79},{"due_date":"2012-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":229.47},{"due_date":"2012-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":242.52},{"due_date":"2012-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":259.37},{"due_date":"2012-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":271.07},{"due_date":"2012-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":285.78}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81.19},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.96},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92.97},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":99.42},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":103.91},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":109.55}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":81.19,"local_amount":211.79,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:51:12Z","rounded_local_amount":219.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250836236},{"amount":87.96,"local_amount":229.47,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:31:08Z","rounded_local_amount":238.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263386022},{"amount":92.97,"local_amount":242.52,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:29:42Z","rounded_local_amount":251.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270099112},{"amount":310.42,"local_amount":809.8,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:27:34Z","rounded_local_amount":840.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283202146},{"amount":2.46,"local_amount":6.42,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-16T08:36:47Z","rounded_local_amount":6.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287099087}],"funded_date":"2011-12-21T02:41:18Z","paid_date":"2012-07-16T08:36:47Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sherry Bess","image":833485}},{"id":369666,"name":"Sendeu","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sendeu is a 29-year-old single man who practices maize farming.

Given the extent of the problem, the government does not seem to be in a position to give full support where it is needed in order for this educational sector to flourish. The sector therefore requires initiatives from locally-based associations, which are aware of the need to participate in such undertakings. This is why the Association for the Community Support and Development Initiative of Thiaroye-Sur-Mer \u2013 whose aim is to help increase the availability of preschool education and improve its quality \u2013 has opened a school within the community that is subsidized by the members of the Association. It is therefore out of concern to achieve these objectives that we are asking you for this loan. The loan will enable us to strengthen the activities in this sector. Students pay a monthly contribution, which will allow us to repay this loan, as well as help with other activities. \r\nOur Group has 11 members and the reason we have posted only one photo, that of the Association\u2019s president, is because we were unable to have a photo taken of the entire group. We are therefore listing below the names of the other 10 Association members. \r\n1-Assane Gueye \r\n2-Lamine Samg 3-Salif Diedhiou 4-Astou K Seye \r\n5-Chieckh T Diagne \r\n6-Baytir Sy \r\n7-Dialma Badji \r\n8-Massamba L\u00f4 \r\n9-N\u00e9n\u00e9 Diabang \r\n10-Mamadou Dieng\r\n Translated from French by Sarah Llewellyn, Kiva Volunteer.\r\nLe niveau actuel de couverture des besoins en \u00e9ducation pour la cat\u00e9gorie class\u00e9e  dans la petite enfance est tr\u00e8s faible dans la commune d\u2019arrondissement de thiaroye sur mer.

She has already received and successfully repaid one loan from SELFINA, and now requires a new loan in order to purchase dresses, shirts, and trousers for resale. She thanks you for your support.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>SELFINA is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility, as a practical way to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>SELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-leasing. Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed not-creditworthy by financial institutions as they lack tangible collateral assets. This leads to poor financial support hence poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>SELFINA buys and leases equipment to women. Where a client needs working capital SELFINA buys equipment from said client, extending a loan to her, then leasing back the same equipment \u2013 a process called a sale and leaseback arrangement.<\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":825,"image":{"id":151389,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"To expand her range of clothing","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Kyela","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-9.583333 33.85","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-04-20T17:00:13Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":825,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Christina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-05-05T03:25:05Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":1000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":825,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2008-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2008-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2008-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2008-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2008-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2008-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":82.5},{"due_date":"2008-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":82.5},{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":82.5},{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":82.5},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":82.5},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":82.5},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":82.5},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":82.5},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":82.5},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":82.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":83,"local_amount":100606.06,"processed_date":"2008-06-05T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:35:04Z","rounded_local_amount":101758,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":229066},{"amount":83,"local_amount":100606.06,"processed_date":"2008-07-05T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:38:12Z","rounded_local_amount":101758,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":258175},{"amount":83,"local_amount":100606.06,"processed_date":"2008-08-05T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:42:11Z","rounded_local_amount":101758,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":286928},{"amount":83,"local_amount":100606.06,"processed_date":"2008-09-05T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-09-20T07:26:17Z","rounded_local_amount":101758,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":317184},{"amount":83,"local_amount":100606.06,"processed_date":"2008-10-05T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-17T07:21:45Z","rounded_local_amount":101758,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":348935},{"amount":80,"local_amount":96969.7,"processed_date":"2008-11-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T03:22:06Z","rounded_local_amount":98080,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5347590},{"amount":82.5,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2008-12-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:06:29Z","rounded_local_amount":101145,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9970210},{"amount":82.5,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-01-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:12:05Z","rounded_local_amount":101145,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14886460},{"amount":82.5,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-02-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:01:15Z","rounded_local_amount":101145,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20435745},{"amount":82.5,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-03-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:53:46Z","rounded_local_amount":101145,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130050}],"funded_date":"2008-04-21T03:25:05Z","paid_date":"2009-04-15T21:53:46Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":49193,"name":"Glenda Elizabeth","description":{"languages":["es"],"texts":{"es":"<p>Glenda carries on door-to-door sales of cosmetics (sales on credit).

Over the 4 years of membership, her family has seen a visible improvement in its economy, by investing in pig and duck farming. Currently, her family is raising 8 pigs and 200 ducks. With 200 ducks, the average income of her family is 200.000\u0111. In 2007, the family was able to buy 1 ploughing machine for its own use and to provide ploughing services to other people in the region. The average income every season is 15.000.000\u0111. Her husband still has a job of construction worker. In idle times, he can expect to earn a daily average of 70.000\u0111. With such a regular income, the family was already able to build a spacious house. For this round, the family would like to borrow 9.000.000 to invest further into duck farming. The average income is 6.000.000\u0111 per month.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Vietnamese by Minh Bui, Kiva

Thanks to an increasing demand, she needs the loan that she is asking for to increase her merchandise.<\/p> \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Maria Ramirez-Gregg, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":203948,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Shoe Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Increase the quantity of shoes that she sells to satisfy the demand.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Juliaca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15.5 -70.133333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2008-10-01T07:02:47Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Roberta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-10-15T18:56:18Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2008-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2009-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2009-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2009-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2009-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":166.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.35}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":58.33,"local_amount":166.67,"processed_date":"2008-11-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T00:35:58Z","rounded_local_amount":172.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5336020},{"amount":58.33,"local_amount":166.67,"processed_date":"2008-12-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T01:22:03Z","rounded_local_amount":172.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9957202},{"amount":58.33,"local_amount":166.67,"processed_date":"2009-01-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T14:05:49Z","rounded_local_amount":172.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":10227452},{"amount":58.33,"local_amount":166.67,"processed_date":"2009-02-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T20:05:23Z","rounded_local_amount":172.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20422687},{"amount":58.33,"local_amount":166.67,"processed_date":"2009-03-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:36:37Z","rounded_local_amount":172.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27115910},{"amount":58.35,"local_amount":166.65,"processed_date":"2009-04-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:46:39Z","rounded_local_amount":172.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36010871}],"funded_date":"2008-10-01T18:56:18Z","paid_date":"2009-05-15T21:46:39Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Maria Ramirez-Gregg and fa","image":null}},{"id":69691,"name":"Flavio Jaime","description":{"languages":["pt","en"],"texts":{"pt":"Flavio Jaime M.  \u00e9 Natural de Maputo cidade, tem 31 anos de idade .

He is 31 years old, married and has 3 children -- they are 3, 4 and 6 years old respectively. He is not responsible for anybody else. Flavio went to school only up until the 5th grade because he became an orphan at an young age and could not continue his education because he had to move in with his grandparents. He has always lived in the agricultural region of Massaca where he owns a smallholding and, for the last 13 years, has worked as a farmer. He works a split shift from 6:00am - 10:00am and 4:00pm - 6:00pm and he has 4 employees. He learned this skill by working on others smallholdings around the same area. The smallholding's monthly production may reach approximately 48000,00mt in horticulture trade -- a part of which gets saved away. He lives in his own home. This will be Flavio's second loan request. He previously obtained a loan of 30000,00mt from Pro-Credito. Flavio became aware of Hluvuku through a friend who was already a member. In the future, he wishes to build a loan-sponsored commercial establishment to sell agricultural products. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Bertolt Cantalice, Kiva

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n<P>\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

As a mother she has tried to strengthen herself in order to help her children in their various professions so that she won\u2019t feel like a burden at home as her children live with their own families. Since she doesn\u2019t have the strength needed to do her work with normalcy, she had the idea of renting some rooms as her house is very big. Living alone was something very sad and now she can share her home with her renters, who provide company for her. This is why Mary works to provide better living conditions for her renters, who are happy to live in her home as she treats them with much love and patience, and are timely with their rent payments. But now Mary needs an inversion of capital, as she is planning to build a second story to her home in order to house more people and support herself. This is her 14th loan with Micofinanzas PRISMA. These loans enable her to generate greater income and above all develop her abilities in the communal bank where the members have diverse jobs. With the 2000 soles she will buy construction materials she needs to build the second floor of her home.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Cindy Kendall, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":362503,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":null,"use":"Buy construction materials to add a second story to her home","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-08-06T02:20:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":675,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mary","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-07-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":163.74},{"due_date":"2009-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":168.3},{"due_date":"2009-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":178.69},{"due_date":"2009-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":184.45},{"due_date":"2009-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":195.03},{"due_date":"2010-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":202.11},{"due_date":"2010-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":211.51},{"due_date":"2010-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":224.54},{"due_date":"2010-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":231.8},{"due_date":"2010-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":239.83}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.26},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.8},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.31},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.25},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65.83},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.21},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.38},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.78},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.24},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.94}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":55.26,"local_amount":163.74,"processed_date":"2009-08-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:24:46Z","rounded_local_amount":164.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73641679},{"amount":56.8,"local_amount":168.3,"processed_date":"2009-09-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:38:17Z","rounded_local_amount":168.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87081120},{"amount":60.31,"local_amount":178.69,"processed_date":"2009-10-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:10:14Z","rounded_local_amount":179.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96997270},{"amount":62.25,"local_amount":184.45,"processed_date":"2009-11-19T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:55:27Z","rounded_local_amount":184.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103842614},{"amount":300.45,"local_amount":890.21,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-22T09:38:17Z","rounded_local_amount":892.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734190},{"amount":139.93,"local_amount":414.61,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:38:16Z","rounded_local_amount":415.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136717193}],"funded_date":"2009-08-10T11:29:56Z","paid_date":"2010-05-15T11:38:16Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Cindy Kendall","image":797722}},{"id":131150,"name":"Mary Jane","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mary Jane B. is from the village of Inawaan, Valencia City.

They sell all kinds of products like: rice, sugar, oil and detergents, among other things.  She works every day from 6am until 8pm and sometimes even later.  Besides these products they also sell meat, chicken, fish and school supplies.  They stock up in Portoviejo because they are less expensive there.  Certain products are delivered to her store.

They are in their first loan cycle.  Also, as 'Alfa' means the beginning of something, they gave their group this name.  The group has three members: Ana Carina, Edgar and Amelia.  Each of them has requested their loan for different purposes.  Edgar is the group's representative and he will invest his loan in buying a copier, three consumables and paper for printing different sizes such as letter and legal.  He tells us that he is 27 years old and has been married to Amelia for 7 years.  The couple have two children: one is 12 years old and in middle school, and their youngest is 6 years old and in elementary school.\r\n\r\nEdgar started his business (an Internet cafe) as his children's school expenses are very high.  He has had this business for three years.  He didn't have a stable place for his business but one year ago he finally managed to set up his premises.  His Internet cafe still doesn't have a name and he will continue looking for one.  Up to now, he hasn't had any problems with his business, only when his profits fall which usually happens during the holiday period.  However, he is now getting used to this.  He says that it is normal and therefore it doesn't worry him.  One of Edgar's goals is to be able to lower his prices so that he can attract more customers.\r\n\r\nAmelia requested her loan to buy a printer and toner for her business which is also an Internet cafe.  Ana Carina has requested her loan to buy Fuller-brand cosmetics such as creams, perfumes, etc.  In general, the group is very happy and they are grateful to FRAC for their sincere understanding in supporting them and giving them this loan which they need so badly."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":875,"image":{"id":862426,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Internet Cafe","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to buy a copier, consumables and printing paper","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2011-09-20T00:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":875,"lender_count":29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ana Carina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Edgar ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Amelia Edith","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-08-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":11000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":875,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1265.69},{"due_date":"2011-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1295.48},{"due_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":1325.97},{"due_date":"2011-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1357.17},{"due_date":"2011-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":1389.12},{"due_date":"2011-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":1421.81},{"due_date":"2011-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":1455.27},{"due_date":"2011-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":1489.49}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100.68},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":103.05},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105.47},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":107.96},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":110.5},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":113.1},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":115.76},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":118.48}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":309.2,"local_amount":3887.14,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:12:16Z","rounded_local_amount":3997.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232807742},{"amount":218.46,"local_amount":2746.29,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:22:42Z","rounded_local_amount":2823.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238618842},{"amount":228.86,"local_amount":2877.08,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:04:11Z","rounded_local_amount":2958.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244573082},{"amount":118.48,"local_amount":1489.49,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:12:37Z","rounded_local_amount":1531.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250784792}],"funded_date":"2011-09-21T15:33:04Z","paid_date":"2012-01-15T10:12:37Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Oxnard","image":null}},{"id":340984,"name":"Mama Umoja Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Penina is the facilitator of the Mama Umoja group.

O. is a 35-year old father of three school-aged children.  He lives in one of the slums of Kisumu, Kenya, and runs the longest- standing community pharmacy in his area.  He received his pharmacy certificate after finishing secondary school in 1993, and, for 13 years now, has been working in the same area (pictured).  As a result of the long years of his work, the community knows Patrick personally. The next closest dispensary in the area is far away; therefore, people prefer to go to him for advice and drugs.  Patrick has also been trained as a community health worker, and has been providing home-based care for people living with HIV\/AIDS for the past three years. He sells drugs at lower prices than his competitors, and often gives free drugs to his clients or those in need. His best-selling products are painkillers, anti-malaria and family planning drugs, allergy medications, ulcer, worms and skin infection treatment, and various syrups for children suffering from malaria and upper respiratory infections.

life and in future be able to send his dearest little daughter to school. Farming has been his major source of income. Alimardon produces rice once a year. In spite of the expensive farm inputs, merchants buy their rice at a lower price. Because of this, Alimardon is requesting a loan of 700 USD to support his farming business and to avoid asking for credits from merchants who charge higher interest. <P>\r\n\r\nAlimardon is grateful that he is able to borrow from lenders that offer small interest and create better opportunities in their lives - thus helping their family to be free from poverty. Alimardon said that through prayers and hard work, his dreams can be achieved someday. Providing his daughter with education is one of the important things that Alimardon prioritizes.  <P>\r\n \r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International<P>\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and with its famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to epic mountain passes, communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 percent of the country is mountainous and only 7 percent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\nIMON's History\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She needs a loan to buy thread, scissors, buttons, higher quality fabrics, zippers, embroidery items, as capital investment to get her business off the ground. \nEach woman in the committee devotes herself to her independent activities, while working with the other members to cooperate and lead their group in the correct direction to achieve their shared goals. \n"}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":433205,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Merchandise","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PY","country":"Paraguay","town":"Coronel Oviedo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-25.416667 -56.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":58,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1150,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Graciela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Margarita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Karina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Silvia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dora","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elva","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Patrocinia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tereza","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Martina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Martina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Zoraida","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Francisca","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Angelica","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ramona","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ciria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nicolaza","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lidia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ciria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-10-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PYG","disbursal_amount":5400000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":1150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":450000},{"due_date":"2009-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":450000},{"due_date":"2009-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":450000},{"due_date":"2009-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":450000},{"due_date":"2009-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":450000},{"due_date":"2009-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":450000},{"due_date":"2009-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":450000},{"due_date":"2009-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":450000},{"due_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":450000},{"due_date":"2010-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":450000},{"due_date":"2010-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":450000},{"due_date":"2010-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":450000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":95.83},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":95.84},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":95.83},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":95.83},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":95.84},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":95.83},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":95.83},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":95.84},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":95.83},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":95.83},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":95.84},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":95.83}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":160057,"name":"John","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"John is 40 years old and married with two school-aged daughters.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

I have been in a common law relationship for the last 10 years.  Recently we finished building our own house since we had previously been living in my parent's home.  The four children that I have go to elementary school and there are many expenses because the teachers constantly ask for things that the children need to bring to school.  I make a living by raising sheep.  I am asking for the loan to be able to buy sheep and be able to raise them.  Taking care of the animals is simple for me because I have a corral and I leave them there and only take food and water for them to eat and drink.

He is single, 49 years old, and studied until fifth grade.  He had to stop school because of a lack of transportation, since the school was very far from his house.  He is the father of 12 children, whose ages range from five to 25 years old.  The oldest is already married and the rest go to school.\r\n\r\nJequicene left Inhambane for Namaacha, a town on the border of Swaziland, looking for work.  He began by working as a guard for Franciscan sisters for 12 years.  But because of the rising cost of living, and because he wasn't earning much, he began a business selling earthenware pots and gave up his job to concentrate on more lucrative businesses.  With his business earnings, he managed to build two houses, since he had two wives, and also bought a vehicle to help him with his work.  Now, in addition to selling earthenware pots, he provides informal public transportation services and has a daily income of 200 mtn.  He also raises chickens.  This occupation he learned with the Franciscan sisters (where he would spend 12,000 mtn to raise 200 chicks).\r\n\r\nThis poultry business earns an income of 5,000 mt in every cycle, and it is growing with the loan he had from Hluvuku-Kiva.  These days, raising 500 chicks costs 30,000 MT in each phase, and therefore has a profit of 12,000MT.  And he manages to pay family expenses (caring for his parents who live with him in his house) and his children's studies.  Each month he is able to save 3,000 MT.\r\n\r\nThis is the second loan for Jequicene with Hluvuku and Kiva.  The first 18,000 MT were used to grow his chicken raising business.  He managed to repay it with no problem, and asks for this second loan of 22,000 MT to enlarge the size of his stock.  He is confident that he will repay it ahead of time and and ask for a new loan to grow his business, each time a little more.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Heidi Petersen, Kiva

She is married to Rogelio J., a driver, and is the mother of two children, both of whom are studying. The elder child is in high school while the other is enrolled in elementary. By the grace of God, Norma has managed to support her children's schooling. At this time, she is working hard to be able to send both of them all the way through college. This is a dream for most Filipino parents like Norma as she herself has been a college undergraduate and believes that a college diploma is the best inheritance parents can leave to their children.\r\n\r\nNorma maintains a variety store and a direct selling business. She sells clothing, footwear, undergarments, cosmetics, frozen cuts of meat and other products mostly through the popular direct selling brand, Avon, and a popular local meat brand.  A customer's order is bought in cash by the dealer and then given to the customer with a one-month-to-pay credit. The dealer\u2019s cost price is lower than the price in the catalogue, and these are the profits that dealers earn as their income. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 600 in sales every day from her variety store and direct selling business.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operating her business, she is requesting a PHP 10,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy orders for her customers. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n \r\nNorma dreams of being able to give both her children a good, high quality education through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital and pay microfinance loans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":617969,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To buy orders for her customers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Caloocan City","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2010-10-15T10:00:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":250,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Norma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-09-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":666.62}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":100,"local_amount":4000.02,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T13:20:46Z","rounded_local_amount":4343.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177380507},{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":3333.35,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-16T11:02:18Z","rounded_local_amount":3619.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182816841},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":2666.63,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T12:43:07Z","rounded_local_amount":2895.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188652784}],"funded_date":"2010-10-15T12:18:20Z","paid_date":"2011-01-15T12:43:07Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":242650,"name":"Gred","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Gred es socia del Banco Comunal \u201cCoraz\u00f3n de Jes\u00fas\u201d  ubicado en el distrito Juliaca, provincia San Rom\u00e1n y departamento de Puno, tiene 23 a\u00f1os de edad, de estado civil soltera y no tiene  hijos, la se\u00f1orita continua con sus estudios de educaci\u00f3n superior.\n\nGred viene trabajando con el Movimiento Manuela Ramos desde hace un a\u00f1o, el primer pr\u00e9stamo fue de S\/. 350.00 nuevos soles, dinero que le sirvi\u00f3 para  incrementar el capital de  su negocio venta de salchimote.\n\nLa se\u00f1orita solicitar\u00e1 un nuevo pr\u00e9stamo de  S\/. 700.00 nuevos soles, dinero que le servir\u00e1 para comprar ma\u00edz, pollo y otros insumos m\u00e1s para su negocio de venta de salchimote.\n\t\nSu sue\u00f1o es tener un capital propio, tener trabajo y no tener deudas.\n\nLo que m\u00e1s le gusta de su Banco Comunal es la puntualidad y el apoyo mutuo.\n","en":"Gred is a member of the Communal Bank \u201cCoraz\u00f3n de Jes\u00fas\u201d (Heart of Jesus) which is located in the District of Juliaca, San Rom\u00e1n Province, Department of Puno.

This area always lacks bus services. \r\n\r\n<p>Erdeneselenge is planning to buy a plot of land upon which to build a family house later on. She has started negotiations and she needs to pay the money for the land. She and her husband are going to use their savings to pay for the land, but still need some additional money. Erdeneselenge is requesting a loan to be used as the remaining payment for the land plot.

Starting with the sum of 13,500 som (KGS) Kulsara has been able to expand her herd, which now has four cows and two calves and yields a profit of 7,000 som monthly. An additional source of income this year will also be a three acre plot of potatoes of land which Kulsara is planning to sell in May\/July of next year. To further develop her livestock business, Kulsara has turned to \"Bai-Tushum and partners\" for a loan of 80,000 som (KGS) to purchase four more calves for fattening and sale.

She has been in this line of work for approximately 10 years.  Flor enjoys this job because it has enabled her to have an income for taking care of the household expenses and providing an adequate education for her children.

In addition to selling food in her house, she also delivers orders to those who need them.  In this way, she stays busy all day.  Nevertheless, she is looking for a way to construct a restaurant where she can receive more clients and have the opportunity to give her youngest son a college education.

B. is retired and lives in Vahdat.  He has six children, and his oldest child is now working in Russia.  However, the family still needs money, so Abdujabor raises livestock as a business.  He purchases calves at low prices and sells them on for a small profit.  Since the earnings from his business are not large, Abdujabor has applied for a loan in order to buy another pair of calves.  This will help him increase his sales volume.  In addition, the calves that he sells provide fresh meat for the local population.

She lives in her mother\u2019s house with her younger sister. She has sold essential products, in addition to sweets and drinks, for 5 years inside her house. She likes being able to give a good deal to her clients and to see her business grow day to day. The business is very profitable because it is located in a busy area. The difficult thing for her is that there are often small robberies by inconsiderate people. They enter her business, and, when she\u2019s not looking, they take products in secret. This is her seventh loan with MFP. With the money that she is requesting, she wants to build bars to protect her business. She also wants to supply more products to her business and, later, to have a mini-market. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Avni Shah, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":224180,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To increase her merchandise and to build bars for protection","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2008-11-23T18:20:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":500,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mary","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-10-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":223.25},{"due_date":"2008-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":236.25},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":245.71},{"due_date":"2009-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":253.37},{"due_date":"2009-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":267.13},{"due_date":"2009-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":274.29}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":74.42},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":78.75},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":81.9},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":84.46},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":89.04},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.43}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":74.42,"local_amount":223.25,"processed_date":"2008-11-17T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T00:39:43Z","rounded_local_amount":230.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5336184},{"amount":78.75,"local_amount":236.25,"processed_date":"2008-12-17T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T01:24:04Z","rounded_local_amount":243.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9957599},{"amount":81.9,"local_amount":245.71,"processed_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T14:06:52Z","rounded_local_amount":253.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":10227857},{"amount":84.46,"local_amount":253.37,"processed_date":"2009-02-17T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T20:06:16Z","rounded_local_amount":261.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20423089},{"amount":89.04,"local_amount":267.13,"processed_date":"2009-03-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:37:46Z","rounded_local_amount":275.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27116325},{"amount":91.43,"local_amount":274.29,"processed_date":"2009-04-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:47:22Z","rounded_local_amount":282.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36011273}],"funded_date":"2008-11-23T20:58:37Z","paid_date":"2009-05-15T21:47:22Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Avni","image":null}},{"id":77932,"name":"Ramiro","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El Sr. Ramiro I. trabaja desde hace 5 a\u00f1os en el rubro llantero, dedicandos\u00e9 al inflado parchado y colocado de llantas pinchadas y desinfladas, trabajo que realiza laboriosamente desde muy tempranas horas de la ma\u00f1ana, hasta altas horas de la noche, atendiendo principalmente a transportistas p\u00fablicos, debido a que su negocio se encuentra en la ruta de varias l\u00edneas de buses.

She is a widow and has an adult son. Valieva has a successful flour-selling business at the local market in the town of Isfara, where she sells an assortment of high-quality sorts of flour. Because she buys the flour wholesale, her prices are cheaper than those of her competitors. For this reason, she has many customers who buy her flour straight from her house. Today, there is a great demand for her goods, which is why she wants to take an individual loan. She has requested a loan of $800 to add to her working capital and allow her to purchase more goods. She promises to repay the loan within nine months. Valieva is ready to work even harder, make sacrifices, and push every once in a while to achieve her goals and become a successful entrepreneur. We believe her perseverance and clear vision will become key success factors in her small business.\r\n<p>\r\nMore about Tajikistan\r\n<p>\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes being a key post along the Silk Road and being the location of the end of the rule of Alexander the Great. It is also known for its famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi, and many others. The country, filled with epic mountain passes, is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, and boasts a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 percent of the country is mountainous and only 7 percent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

She has produced potatoes, quinoa, and wheat for 15 years.  She processes the potatoes to dry them and to sell them at a better price.  Her husband is a fundamental part of her work, and she helps him in everything that is necessary.  But during planting and\/or harvest season is when they need more people, so they hire workers, and they have to make a big investment to pay them.  But selling the dried potatoes in the city markets lets them recover their investment.  This motivates Edith to keep planning her future by increasing her prodcution and searching for new selling points.  This is her eighth loan with Microfinanzas Prisma.  She drives unity in her communal bank, and her ninth loan won't be the exception.  The money she is requesting will be invested in the purchase of firewood to cook potatoes that she later dries in the sun.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Tanya Harper, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":150,"image":{"id":354246,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To purchase firewood to process potatoes","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"HUANCAYO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.066667 -75.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-07-19T03:20:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":150,"lender_count":6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Edith","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-06-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":400,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":400}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":150}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":150,"local_amount":400,"processed_date":"2009-10-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:08:39Z","rounded_local_amount":455.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96997141}],"funded_date":"2009-07-19T04:04:57Z","paid_date":"2009-11-16T03:08:39Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tanya Harper","image":783083}}]}
